BEGIN NOW I Dreamed a dream of dreaming. END
BEGIN NOW I saw that dream come true. END
BEGIN NOW That's when I  decided not to dream END
BEGIN NOW And than I woke up on the ceiling! END
BEGIN NOW And I couldn't find my face! END
BEGIN NOW And I fumbled in the feeling and falling and all the realizing in my head! END
BEGIN NOW My toy!! END
BEGIN NOW It seems as though on the anniversary of my birth, the instigators of this miracle of life were too busy to remember their beautiful creation. END
BEGIN NOW We’ve only been through this twenty two times so far. END
BEGIN NOW Why not make it twenty three? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my dark soul. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my dark tormented soul. END
BEGIN NOW And what shall you say when I call and remind you? END
BEGIN NOW Mother? END
BEGIN NOW Will you tell me that you had to sell a cow? END
BEGIN NOW You were too busy selling a cow to call your son on his birthday. END
BEGIN NOW And Father, what shall you say? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you remarried, and you wanted to spend time with your new wife? END
BEGIN NOW Too busy igniting another flame under a keg of sadness and destruction. END
BEGIN NOW You’re gonna drink again, daddy. END
BEGIN NOW You always do when you get remarried. END
BEGIN NOW Your mom sells cows? END
BEGIN NOW How long have you been standing there? END
BEGIN NOW Long enough to know that your mom is a purveyor of bovine and your dad is a perving pyro wino. END
BEGIN NOW It’s my birthday and nobody cares. END
BEGIN NOW Are you having a party? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Well that’s why. END
BEGIN NOW Will you throw me a party? END
BEGIN NOW I’m broke. END
BEGIN NOW I’ll pay for it… END
BEGIN NOW Well… END
BEGIN NOW Here’s $50. END
BEGIN NOW Just don’t tell me when you’re gonna throw it. END
BEGIN NOW Oh…  you want a surprise party… END
BEGIN NOW You sir, know the value of small talk. END
BEGIN NOW I find it fascinating, your turn of phrase, your instinct for finding the right comment, and presenting it at the perfect moment... END
BEGIN NOW Encore, mon-frer. END
BEGIN NOW Encore. END
BEGIN NOW What’s up dude. END
BEGIN NOW Hey man. END
BEGIN NOW What’s up, NAME4. END
BEGIN NOW I heard that the human mind only stays stimulated for one and a half minutes. END
BEGIN NOW I’m testing this by watching clips of Monty Python and timing the skits. END
BEGIN NOW If my theory is correct, their humor is based on this notion. END
BEGIN NOW Bitchin. END
BEGIN NOW If I can learn to utilize this newfound knowledge, if I can just isolate the recurring conundrum, I’ll be able to extrapolate the… END
BEGIN NOW YES! END
BEGIN NOW Nobody even cares! END
BEGIN NOW I mean, isn’t it an important day? END
BEGIN NOW Shouldn’t my loved ones be flocking around me showering me with adoration? END
BEGIN NOW Maybe they died. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe everyone I know died. END
BEGIN NOW Boy. END
BEGIN NOW What a horrible thought. END
BEGIN NOW NAME3 will wander off mumbling to himself about how horrible that would be. END
BEGIN NOW He goes off in the direction of Cheapskate Hill. END
BEGIN NOW The camera takes its place behind NAME2, who gets up and wanders through the room, past NAME4 at the computer. END
BEGIN NOW NAME4 glances up at him. END
BEGIN NOW Hey man. END
BEGIN NOW They used to have a basement. END
BEGIN NOW Right down here. END
BEGIN NOW But in 1993, a cop came to break up a kegger, and they locked him in the basement and covered it. END
BEGIN NOW We still drop leftovers down the ventilation tubes for him. END
BEGIN NOW I heard somewhere that they gave him a homemade lobotomy, just to make sure he wouldn't escape. END
BEGIN NOW THERE'S A FUCKIN HOLE IN MY BRAIN!!!!! END
BEGIN NOW Quickly now! END
BEGIN NOW he's found the food. END
BEGIN NOW We must disappear with all haste! END
BEGIN NOW Oh. END
BEGIN NOW It's just NAME3 and his primal scream therapy. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing to worry about. END
BEGIN NOW              "I'm sad because... END
BEGIN NOW Because there's a big fuckin hole in my brain where faith used to be and there's a dark spot where I find my solace, and the truth is you're just another empty fuckin whisper of a meaningless connection to no one!! END
BEGIN NOW Just another dead fuckin phone call to the godless raging pitiful spit foam death gaaaa!!!!!!!" END
BEGIN NOW Why the crap did you let me sleep in NAME1? END
BEGIN NOW I told you I had a meeting with my counselor! END
BEGIN NOW What’s all this? END
BEGIN NOW It’s a practice interview. END
BEGIN NOW I let you sleep in because you were dreaming! END
BEGIN NOW Your leg was kicking and you were whimpering. END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t whimpering. END
BEGIN NOW And that’s no reason to let me miss my friggin appointment! END
BEGIN NOW I don’t interrupt dreams. END
BEGIN NOW It’s against my belief system. END
BEGIN NOW It’s your mind going through its purging style!! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hey, we gotta use your room for a practice photo shoot with Robin Williams. END
BEGIN NOW You have Robin Williams END
BEGIN NOW Well, no. END
BEGIN NOW not yet. END
BEGIN NOW For now NAME4 is his stand in. END
BEGIN NOW His understudy if you will. END
BEGIN NOW Stay out of my room NAME1!! END
BEGIN NOW We’re still having Band Practice in there tonite!! END
BEGIN NOW So anyways, Robin… END
BEGIN NOW Oooh! END
BEGIN NOW He he… END
BEGIN NOW Here, you left this outside. END
BEGIN NOW What’s with Bob Ross? END
BEGIN NOW He helps me sleep at night. END
BEGIN NOW What the hell are you doing with NAME1? END
BEGIN NOW I’m helping him start his company! END
BEGIN NOW You know he’s delusional! END
BEGIN NOW Why you gotta encourage him? END
BEGIN NOW I dunno. END
BEGIN NOW He’s fun to watch. END
BEGIN NOW He says he’s gonna interview Robin Williams and needs me to be his stand in. END
BEGIN NOW Oh yeah? END
BEGIN NOW What else does he have going on? END
BEGIN NOW Well, he’s got a music video for his Gypsy Dance Tune, You better help with that one. END
BEGIN NOW After all, you’re in the band. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I guess I’ll tag along for that one. END
BEGIN NOW You don’t believe in his whole company thing, though, do you? END
BEGIN NOW No, I don’t think he has the capacity to run a company. END
BEGIN NOW That’s insane. END
BEGIN NOW I think he’s doomed. END
BEGIN NOW But it’ll be real fun to watch. END
BEGIN NOW That’s the spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Well, just don’t drag me into this shit. END
BEGIN NOW I’m already busy with Charlotte and trying to get back into school. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t dream of it. END
BEGIN NOW Can’t waste time making memories. END
BEGIN NOW You got tomorrow to plan for. END
BEGIN NOW And remember, there’s always another tomorrow to start planning for… END
BEGIN NOW Hey NAME1, NAME3 thinks you’re doomed. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you think I’m doomed, NAME3? END
BEGIN NOW You’re trying to make sophisticated art, but in your deepest heart, you’re just white trash. END
BEGIN NOW There’s talk of doom. END
BEGIN NOW And White Trash. END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t expect these vibrations so early in the game. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, they just need…  a show of strength. END
BEGIN NOW Why are you in my closet? END
BEGIN NOW Whatcha doin there, NAME1y Boy? END
BEGIN NOW The company! END
BEGIN NOW We’re gonna document the development of the company as if it were a reality series! END
BEGIN NOW That’s stupid. END
BEGIN NOW That’s fucking stupid, NAME1. END
BEGIN NOW Oh come on! END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be the first person in the closet, doing your fucking Primal Scream shit. END
BEGIN NOW What the hell is that anyways? END
BEGIN NOW It’s purging!! END
BEGIN NOW It’s therapy!! END
BEGIN NOW Not in public NAME3, that’s what we’re trying to avoid. END
