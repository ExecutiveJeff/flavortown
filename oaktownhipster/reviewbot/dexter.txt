FADE IN:
EXT. A CHURCH - DAY
Birds chirp. The sun shines. Blue skies for miles. In
short, a damn fine day to be alive. And then:
A DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE
Jerks to a stop in front of the holy edifice. Out of the
beat-to-shit Carrera convertible climbs:
HANK MOODY
A man in his thirties. A figure in black.
He's good-looking, yeah, but the thing that's always helped
Hank with the opposite sex is the fact that he simply doesn't
give a rat’s ass what anyone thinks about him.
He removes his sunglasses. Winces in disgust.
Hank is not a guy who appreciates the birds and the sun and
tranquility of nature and whatnot.
INSIDE THE CHURCH
Hank saunters in, immediately at odds with the holy vibe.
The place is dark. Cold. Empty.
He snuffs his cigarette in a nearby bowl of Holy H2O. His
footsteps loud as hell as he makes his way down the center
aisle. He arrives at the altar. Looks up. And there he is:
THE MAN HIMSELF
Up on the cross. Hanging out. Doing his thing.
HANK
Alright, big guy. You and me... we've
never done this. But desperate times
call for desperate measures. My name is
Hank --
A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hello, Hank.
Hank reacts, startled, as
A YOUNG NUN
Emerges from the holy green room. Full habit, headdress, and
everything.
HANK
Oh, hey. Sorry about that. I was just
having a little chat with the guy on the
wall up here.
YOUNG NUN
Is there something I can help you with?
HANK
Oh, I wouldn’t want to bother a real,
live person. I was just --
NUN
-- It wouldn't be a bother, Hank. In
fact, that's what I'm here for.
HANK
You're very pleasant, sister. Very
agreeable.
NUN
I think you'll find that I'm very
agreeable indeed.
She smiles. It’s a pretty smile. Some might say sexy.
Which weirds Hank out a little bit. Or maybe it turns him
on. Hard to say.
He gives the Nun a closer look. Pretty eyes, perfect skin.
Despite the holy garb and all that, the girl is attractive.
Who knows? Maybe the holy garb helps.
HANK
Here's the thing. I've been having what
you might call a crisis of faith. Put
simply, I’m an addict.
NUN
(a knowing nod)
Drugs and alcohol.
HANK
A little bit, yeah. But that stuff I can
handle. It’s the sex that’s killing me,
sister. You’re looking at a goddamn
fucking sex addict.
(catches himself)
Sorry about that. I fucked up. Once
again. My apologies.
NUN
Well, normally I would suggest a bunch of
“Our Father’s” and a couple of “Hail
Mary’s,” but I don't think that’s gonna
get it done.
She ponders for a moment. Looks up. Smiles.
2.
NUN
What about a blowjob?
HANK
Come again?
NUN
A blowjob. Would that make you feel any
better?
HANK
A blowjob...? From you...?
The Nun eyes Hank's crotch.
NUN
Something tells me it's not gonna suck
itself, Hank.
HANK
But you're a nun.
She pulls off her headgear. Beautiful blonde hair spills out
all over. Jenna Jameson in a habit. Hank stares, gulps.
HANK
A totally fucking hot nun.
The Nun walks up to him. Close. Unzips his pants. Proceeds
to go down on him. Hank groans...
HANK
Judas Priest...
INT. A BEDROOM SOMEWHERE - DAY
Hank wakes. Simultaneously screaming and cumming. A blur of
flesh and white sheets. A trashy yet indisputably hot young
woman emerges from underneath, wiping her mouth.
This is HEATHER. The nun from the dream. A prototypical
California blonde if ever there was one. Simply stunning.
HEATHER
Bad dream...?
HANK
Yeah. Well... hard to say, really.
HEATHER
You drifted off. And I thought to
myself, “Self, what's the nicest possible
way I could wake up Mr. Hank here?”
3.
HANK
Well, kudos to you, because you
definitely stumbled upon one of the nicer
ways.
HEATHER
You're nice to me, I'm nice to you.
HANK
Very quid pro quo.
(off her look)
Never mind.
Hank grabs a pack of cigarettes off the night stand. Lights
two. Hands one to Heather. They smoke in silence.
HEATHER
Can I tell you something?
Hank is afraid. Very afraid.
HANK
Sure. Anything.
HEATHER
My husband has never given me an orgasm.
HANK
Never?
HEATHER
Ever.
HANK
You’re shitting me.
HEATHER
I shit you not.
HANK
Does he... you know...?
HEATHER
Go downtown? Never.
HANK
Ever?
HEATHER
Well, no, that's not true. He did.
Once. But he made me take a shower
first. And then spent forty-five minutes
trying to find my clit.
HANK
How'd he do?
4.
HEATHER
Not so good. I mean, he came within
spitting distance a couple of times, but
then he veered off in some other
direction. I think he thinks it's on the
bottom.
HANK
Near the vaganus? That's weird.
HEATHER
I thought so.
Hank grins, disappears under the sheets. From the look on
her face, it appears as though he has struck gold.
And then comes the unmistakable SOUND of THE FRONT DOOR
OPENING AND CLOSING. Heather's smile disappears. Hank pops
up --
HANK
What the fuck is that?
HEATHER
That would be my husband.
HANK
Oh, so the guy can't find your clit, but
he has no problem finding you legs
akimbo?
Hank jumps out of bed. Yanking on boxers and a T-shirt.
HANK
Well, m’lady, it’s been a slice, but
seeing as I’s a lover, not a fighter,
it’s time for this fella to put on his
dancing shoes... if I could find them,
that is...
He can’t find his shoes. Or his pants. And the FOOTSTEPS
are getting closer. He shrugs. Starts to go. Returns for a
kiss and then tears ass through the sliding glass doors...
OUT ONTO A STRETCH OF MALIBU BEACHFRONT
A postcard-worthy snapshot of SoCal bliss that Hank has
neither the time or the luxury to appreciate. He creeps
along the side of the house, wincing at ALL THE YELLING
coming from inside, finally ending up...
IN THE DRIVEWAY
Where his DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE awaits. He hops in the car...
fires it up... Billy Idol’s cover of The Doors’ “L.A. Woman”
playing on the stereo...
5.
He closes his eyes, says a silent prayer for escaping almost
certain death, and when he opens them again...
A TATTOOED MILLIONAIRE
Is standing in front of the car. Baseball bat in hand. A
murderous, cuckolded gleam in his eye. A frazzled, halfnaked
Heather watching from the front door. Hank sighs.
HANK
Dude. Just so you know? The little man
in the boat? He’s on the top.
The Husband is confused. Hank wags his tongue between index
and middle finger in a rather crude simulation of
cunnilingus. Winks at Heather.
Then he GUNS IT --
Outraged, the Husband swings, takes out a tailight or some
such, but it’s too late... he’s gone... out into the middle
of PCH. Causing much HONKING and SCREECHING of brakes.
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - MAGIC HOUR
The camera descends, zeroing in on Hank's wounded Porsche,
rocketing towards home...
INT./EXT. DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE - EVENING
Hank cruises down Main Street in Santa Monica, his stomping
grounds...
EXT. HANK'S CONDO - EVENING
Hank pulls up in front of a condo cluster somewhere in the
vicinity of Main Street.
Finds his ex-wife, KAREN, 30's, very pretty, very nononsense,
and their dangerously cute pre-teen daughter,
BECCA, 12, waiting for him.
Hank winces, gets out of the car, still wearing just his
boxers and a T-shirt. Karen gives him a look.
HANK
Don't ask.
KAREN
You're late.
HANK
I'm sorry.
KAREN
Again.
6.
HANK
I’m very sorry?
BECCA
Dad, are you crazy?
HANK
Slightly, yes, but not dangerously so.
KAREN
That depends on who you ask, sweetie.
HANK
Would you like to join us for dinner?
KAREN
Plans.
HANK
Oh, it must be date night.
BECCA
Come on, Mom...
KAREN
Sorry, baby.
Karen gives Becca a kiss. Shoots Hank a look, says under her
breath:
KAREN
You’re a classy guy, Hank.
HANK
That's funny. Coming from you and all.
Karen bites her tongue. Gets in the car. Becca waves.
BECCA
Dad?
HANK
Yeah, baby?
BECCA
Can we watch “Anchorman”?
HANK
Again...?
(off her look)
“Anchorman” it is.
INT. HANK'S CONDO - NIGHT
Hank and Becca walk into the spare lair of a recently
divorced dad. Becca sighs, wanders off. Hank sees a message
BLINKING on the answering machine. Hits PLAY.
7.
A MAN'S VOICE
(on the machine)
Hank. Your friend, but more
importantly... your agent. Remember
me...?
Hank makes a face, hits erase. Becca walks up.
BECCA
Hey, Dad?
HANK
“Anchorman,” right. Let's get on that.
BECCA
Can I ask you something?
HANK
Anything, my love.
BECCA
Why is there a naked woman in your
bedroom?
Beat. Hank freezes.
HANK
Wait right here.
IN THE BEDROOM
There is in fact a NAKED WOMAN in Hank's bedroom.
On his bed, to be more specific. Wrapped up in the sheets.
Looking somewhat chagrined. Hank enters. Naked Lady smiles.
Her name is SANDY.
HANK
What are you doing here?
SANDY
I thought I'd surprise you.
HANK
Well, you surprised my daughter.
SANDY
So that's Becca.
HANK
That's Becca alright.
SANDY
I'm sorry, Hank. I should've called. I
just thought...
Hank softens, sits on the edge of the bed.
8.
HANK
Hey, I'm sorry, too. In fact... maybe we
should think about cooling things off a
little...
SANDY
Excuse me?
HANK
...or not. Either way. I'm easy.
SANDY
So you don't want to see me anymore?
HANK
That's not what I said.
SANDY
You're amazing, Hank. You spend all this
time sweet-talking me into the sack and
now that you've exacted your revenge,
you're done with me?
HANK
Revenge? What are you talking about,
revenge?
SANDY
Come on, you can't tell me that it wasn't
at all satisfying to fuck the wife of the
man who turned your precious little book
into a big shitty movie.
HANK
Well, when you put it that way...
SANDY
What other way is there to put it, Hank?
HANK
Look, I'm sorry, I got carried away. I'm
going through a really crazy time right
now. But --
Sandy narrows her eyes.
SANDY
-- Stop. Have it your way. I'm gonna
let you off easy here. But you know
what? I liked the movie better than the
book.
Hank winces, hurt. Them’s fightin’ words.
HANK
Great. So not only do you give lousy
head, you have shitty taste in movies,
too.
9.
That's when Becca enters, juggling a couple of beers and a
Diet Coke. She hands a beer apiece to Hank and Sandy.
BECCA
Cheers.
They all drink up. A moment.
BECCA
(to Sandy)
So... are you my father’s new girlfriend?
Am I gonna have to get used to you?
What’s the deal?
INT. HANK'S CONDO - NIGHT
Hank has fallen asleep on the couch while watching TV with
Becca. She laughs, looks, sees that he is asleep. She gets
up off the couch, disappears. Returns a moment later with a
blanket. Drapes it over him.
A knock at the door. Becca opens it to Karen. Shushes her.
They both look at the snoozing Hank with a mixture of
sadness, anger and regret.
BECCA
Sometimes I wish we could take him home
with us.
Karen’s heart breaks, but she keeps it together for Becca.
KAREN
Go wait in the car, okay?
Becca shoots her mother a look. Gives her sleeping father a
kiss on the cheek. Karen's heart breaks all over again.
Becca storms out. Karen shakes Hank awake.
HANK
What? Whatsa matter?
(off her look)
Uh-oh. I know that look. That’s not a
happy look.
KAREN
And why would I be happy, Hank?
HANK
My question exactly. You dump me for
some dull-normal. How could you possibly
be happy?
KAREN
Cute.
HANK
The guy can't help it. He’s cute.
10.
KAREN
Maybe I'm unhappy because I leave our
daughter with you for a few hours and she
calls me with a story about a naked woman
in your bedroom.
HANK
Oh, she mentioned that?
KAREN
She mentioned it, yeah.
HANK
So, what? You're jealous?
Karen looks at him in disbelief.
KAREN
You know, you're lucky I don't take away
the little custody you do have. Bill
tried to convince me --
HANK
-- Oh, so your boyfriend’s giving you
legal advice? How sweet!
KAREN
Don't start, Hank.
HANK
You started it. When you cheated on me.
KAREN
I did not cheat on you.
HANK
In what universe is fucking someone while
you're married to someone else not
cheating?!
KAREN
The one in which your marriage is already
over.
Which does a pretty good job of shutting him up.
KAREN
You weren't there for me. All the stupid
shit went to your head. You were out all
the time. Having drinks and going to
parties and flirting with all your little
lit-chick groupies. While I was home
raising our daughter. Blah, blah, blah.
Cliche, cliche, cliche.
HANK
Hey. I never cheated on you. Never.
11.
KAREN
Cheating is not just about fucking
someone, Hank. Bill and I didn't even so
much as touch each other until we were
separated.
HANK
Okay, are you trying to make me throw up?
KAREN
Oh, you're one to talk. You're out there
sticking your dick in anything that
moves, trying to get back at me. Which
is fine. But you know what the worst
thing is? You're not writing. You have
this gift and you're just flushing it
down the toilet.
Beat. Hank softens.
HANK
Maybe you're right. Okay, no maybes.
You're right. I'm a mess. I need some
help. Maybe we could try and --
Karen shakes her head. Cuts him off --
KAREN
Bill and I are getting married.
A sucker-punch to the soul.
HANK
What?
KAREN
He asked. I said yes.
HANK
How could you do that?
KAREN
Does the word 'Duh' mean anything to you?
I love him.
HANK
No, you don't.
KAREN
Yes, I do.
HANK
No, you don't. There's no way in hell
you love that guy.
KAREN
Why not?
12.
HANK
Because he’s a fucking dial tone. He's
everything you said you never wanted.
I'm sure he means well and everything,
but he's not the guy for you. I may be
going through a bit of a rough patch
here, but I haven't lost my mind. You
don't love this guy.
KAREN
How do you know?
HANK
Because I know you.
(then)
Don't I have some say in this?
KAREN
Um, no...
HANK
Are you sure? Because it seems like I
should.
(thinking about it)
Yeah, I guess not.
(then)
So that's it, huh?
KAREN
I guess so.
HANK
Well, best of luck in all future
endeavors. Let me know where you’re
registered. And don't let the door hit
you on your soon-to-be-huge ass on the
way out.
Hank pours himself a drink. He turns, half-expecting her to
still be there. She's not.
INT. HANK'S CONDO - THE NEXT DAY
Hank sits at the kitching table, staring at his Mac laptop.
He launches Microsoft Word, comforted by the familiar startup
screen. And then there it is:
THE BLANK SCREEN
The cursor blinks. Silently mocking him.
He shifts in his seat, uncomfortable. He types the word
"fuck" and holds down the "k" for a long time, filling the
page.
He sighs. Takes a sip of coffee.
He launches the browser. Starts perusing internet porn.
13.
EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
Where the movie adaptation of Hank's novel is playing. “A
Crazy Little Thing Called Love.” Hank walks up, disgusted,
turns away, walks back, buys a ticket.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
Hank walks into the dark theater, Coke and popcorn in hand.
Movie in progress. He finds a seat. Digs into his popcorn.
A cellphone RINGS. Right in front of him.
Hank sighs as the GUY in front of him -- some twentysomething
Persian wannbe-gangsta-type -- proceeds to answer...
CELLPHONE PERSIAN
(into phone)
Talk to me. Hey, baby... wassup? I'm at
the movies. What's going on? Fuck,
babe, I miss you, too...
Hank gives it a minute. When he realizes this is not going
to end anytime soon, he sighs, resigned to his fate. He
carefully places his Coke and popcorn on the floor. Taps
Cellphone Persian on the shoulder.
HANK
Come on, buddy, gimme a break...
Without so much as a look back, Cellphone Persian gives him
the finger. Hank chuckles to himself. He reaches forward.
Grabs the cellphone out of the guy's hand.
HANK
(into phone)
Hello? Hi. Sorry. The asshole you're
calling is gonna have to give you a call
back. Later. After the movie. 'Kay?
Bye now.
Hank hangs up. Hands the phone to said Asshole, who is
outraged. He sputters. Doesn't know what to do.
At this point, OTHER MOVIE-GOERS are watching, curious.
Hank picks up his Coke and popcorn, points to the screen.
HANK
(whispers)
The book was way better.
The phone RINGS again. Cellphone Persian looks at Hank.
Like a child testing a parent.
HANK
Don't do it. Don't you do it...
14.
He answers it. Starts having his conversation all over
again. This time, Hank shakes his head. Heaves a heavy
sigh. Weight of the world and whatnot. Puts down his Coke
and popcorn again.
All of a sudden, he yanks the phone out of the guy's hand.
Hurls it against the wall, shattering it.
The guy jumps to his feet. Hank just looks at him. Weary.
HANK
Are you sure? Are you absolutely
positive you want to do this? I mean,
'cause you could just apologize and we'll
call it a day. Watch the movie, eat some
popcorn. They've got frozen Snickers.
They're good. I'll get you one.
CELLPHONE PERSIAN
Fuck. You.
Hank climbs slowly to his feet. One punch. Two. He
proceeds to beat the living shit out of Cellphone Persian.
In the process, the movie stops and the lights come up.
Hank keeps on kicking ass until Cellphone Persian is just a
bloody, blubbering mess on the floor.
HANK
Next time, just put it on fucking vibrate
or something, okay? Or I don't know,
turn it off maybe. God forbid you miss a
fucking call!
Hank gives the guy one final kick and the whole place ERUPTS
into APPLAUSE. Hoots and hollers galore. Hank takes a bow.
EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
Hank walks outside, where he is greeted with smiles and pats
on the back from other movie patrons. The crowd parts,
revealing...
A POLICE CAR
Parked in front of the theater. Cellphone Persian talking to
A PAIR OF COPS. Cellphone Persian sees Hank, points him out.
The Cops look at him.
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Hank walks out, formulating his first wisecrack, when he sees
the conservatively-attired BILL LEWIS, 40's, waiting for him.
15.
BILL
Hank.
HANK
Bill.
(then)
Where's Karen?
BILL
Home with Becca.
HANK
She's funny, that one.
BILL
Becca? Yeah, she's a character all
right.
HANK
(irritated)
No -- Karen. She knows exactly how to
push my buttons.
BILL
I don't think she was --
HANK
-- Yeah, I'm really not that interested
in what you think, Bill. Thanks for
sharing, though.
BILL
Look, I wanted to come.
HANK
Really?
BILL
Yes.
HANK
Well, this should be interesting.
BILL
I wanted you to see that I'm not the bad
guy here.
HANK
Oh, you're not? Okay.
BILL
It's not that simple, Hank. I mean, life
is complicated, man.
HANK
That's it? That's all you got? 'Life is
complicated, man."? Jesus Christ... way
to dip into the platitudes.
16.
BILL
I guess that's why you're the writer,
Hank.
The guy’s trying to be decent, which only serves to piss Hank
off all the more.
HANK
You know what? Bill, is it? Sometimes
things are that simple. That clear-cut.
Someone is always the bad guy. Someone
has to be.
BILL
So maybe it's you.
HANK
Do you want to get hit?
BILL
Do you want to hit me?
HANK
Kinda, yeah.
BILL
Then go ahead. Take a shot. I'm not
gonna stop you. If that's what you have
to do. But think about it for a minute.
Would you want your daughter to see you
like this?
(leans in close)
Get your shit together, man. For Becca’s
sake, at least.
Fuming, Hank takes a swing. Bill ducks. Quickly socks Hank
in the gut. He goes down. Comes up with a bloody nose.
HANK
Fuck me --
BILL
Racquetball. Five times a week. I'm a
lot stronger than I look.
HANK
Apparently.
BILL
Maybe you’re right, Hank. Maybe
someone’s gotta be the bad guy. You've
been a shitty husband, a fuck-up father,
but don't worry about it. It's taken
care of. Go off and indulge in whatever
little mid-life crisis you're dealing
with. Your family is fine. I'm taking
care of them.
17.
(MORE)
I don't expect a Thank You or anything,
but a little respect might be nice.
Hank smiles. Gives Bill the finger. Bill just shakes his
head. Tosses Hank a handkerchief. Walks off.
EXT. BOOK SOUP - NIGHT
Hank walks down Sunset, aimless, lost in thought. Passes
Book Soup. Sees something. Stops.
IN THE WINDOW
His book is on display. GOD HATES US ALL by Hank Moody. A
bunch of paperbacks. The cover of which is the one-sheet for
the movie. Hank frowns. He walks inside.
INT. BOOK SOUP - LATER
Hank sits in a big, comfy chair, flipping through his own
book, trying to remember who he is. As he reacquaints
himself with his own work...
A YOUNG WOMAN IS WATCHING HIM
Sitting in a big, comfy chair all her own. Opposite him.
Also reading his book. She looks at the picture of Hank on
the inside flap of the book. Yep, same guy. Even if the inthe-flesh
one is looking a little worse for wear.
Her name is MIA. Smart. Sexy. Long, dark hair. Collegeage.
She smiles, watching Hank smile.
HANK
Looks up. Catches her looking at him. He looks down again,
embarrassed. Then, feeling sheepish, he looks up. Gives her
a look. "You got me." She smiles. Fashions her hand into a
pistol and shoots him.
Hank points to the empty seat next to her. "Can I?" She
shrugs. "Sure." He gets up, walks over. Sits down. She
wrinkles her face, annoyed.
MIA
What are you doing?
HANK
What do you mean? You were like, "Sure.
Why not?"
MIA
No. I was, like, totally ambivalent.
HANK
Oh...
18.
BILL (CONT'D)
MIA
You better get up. My boyfriend'll be
back any second.
HANK
(getting up)
You're a weird chick, you know that?
MIA
Yes, I am. I'm also just kidding. Have
a seat. Please.
HANK
What if I don't want to now?
MIA
Your loss. I mean, why the hell would I
want to get to know a guy who's so in
love with himself that he hangs around
bookstores reading his own work?
HANK
Well, if you're under the impression that
I love myself, then you really don't know
me at all.
MIA
Awwww... is someone battling some low
self-esteem?
HANK
You have no idea.
MIA
Poor baby.
Hank extends a hand.
HANK
Hank.
MIA
(holds up the book)
I know.
(smiles, takes his hand)
Mia.
INT. COFFEE BEAN - NIGHT
Hank and Mia and two cups of coffee at a corner table.
MIA
I'm not going to sleep with you.
HANK
Excuse me?
19.
MIA
Not tonight. No way.
HANK
Whoa. Aren't we getting a little ahead
of ourselves here?
MIA
What are you talking about? You don’t
want to sleep with me?
HANK
I haven't decided yet.
MIA
Now I'm definitely not going to sleep
with you.
HANK
I was kidding. Of course I want to sleep
with you.
MIA
Which hardly seems a compliment.
HANK
Hey -- what do you know about it, lady?
MIA
Does the word "duh" mean anything to you?
You're a guy.
Beat. Hank is quiet for a moment.
MIA
What?
HANK
My wife used to say that. I mean, she
still does.
MIA
(disgusted)
Wait a second -- you're married?
HANK
Oh, no. Not married. So not married.
Divorced. Fairly recently. Haven't
gotten used to saying "ex-wife" yet.
Seems kinda harsh, you know?
MIA
Well, now I'm definitely for sure
absolutely not going to sleep with you.
HANK
Why not?!
20.
MIA
Because you're like this wounded bird.
Hank smiles. Disappears into his coffee for a moment.
HANK
Can I ask you something?
MIA
If you must.
HANK
Did you see the movie of my book?
MIA
I did, actually, yeah.
HANK
What'd you think?
MIA
Honestly?
HANK
Brutal truth.
MIA
It kind of sucked. They ruined it. The
director should be killed.
HANK
Oh, I took care of him already.
A beat. Mia smiles, charmed.
MIA
Do you have a girlfriend?
HANK
No, ma'am, I do not.
MIA
So you're like this famous writer, huh?
HANK
Hardly. More like a one-hit wonder.
MIA
Good God, man... stop feeling so sorry
for yourself.
HANK
Give me a reason not to.
She thinks about it for a beat. Smiles.
21.
MIA
I'm not wearing any underwear.
INT. COFFEE BEAN RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Hank and Mia, furiously making out. He lifts her up on the
sink. Slides a hand up her skirt. Smiles wide. The girl
wasn't lying.
HANK
Hey, I thought you said you weren't going
to sleep with me.
MIA
Who said anything about sleeping?
Hank smiles. Back to the kissing...
INT. HANK'S CONDO - NIGHT
And now they’re fucking. She's on top. Looks like they're
having some pretty tremendous sex. Hank's getting close.
Mia smiles. Leans down into his face. Whispers:
MIA
Are you gonna...?
Hank nods. Mia smiles. And just as he's about to...
SHE PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE
A mixture of pain and pleasure so intense Hank doesn't know
quite what to do with himself.
HANK
What the...?!
Mia punches him in the face again. Just as hard.
Hank tries to get out from under her, but she grinds away on
top of him until she has an orgasm of her own. A beat. She
slides off of him, into her clothes, and leaves the room.
He hears the front door open and close. He lights up a
cigarette. And then he starts to laugh.
INT. HANK'S CONDO - MORNING
Sunlight streams in. The sheets are a bloody mess. Hank
wakes slowly, pleasantly, until the events of the night
before hit him. Hard. He jolts up. Checks himself out in
the mirror. His face caked with dried blood. The phone
rings. He answers.
EXT. WESTSIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - SAME
Karen’s out front on her cell.
22.
KAREN
Where are you?
SPLIT-SCREEN: Karen, all dolled-up; Hank, all fucked-up.
HANK
Where am I supposed to be?
KAREN
At school.
Hank winces: Fuck.
HANK
Parent-teacher conference. Right.
KAREN
(fucking asshole)
Right...
HANK
I’ll be right there. I’m just putting my
face on.
INT. CLASSROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER
Hank and Karen sit across from PENNY LYONS -- prim, proper,
and fortyish. As you might imagine, Hank looks like all kind
of shit.
PENNY
I’m happy to report that Becca is a
delightful student. Smart, inquisitive,
full of life --
HANK
Yet I sense a big, hairy “but” lurking
around the corner somewhere.
KAREN
Hank --
PENNY
No, it’s okay. He’s right.
(then)
But... I’m slightly worried about her
emerging sexuality.
KAREN
What?!
HANK
Thank god...
(off Karen’s look)
She’s a lesbian. Thank god.
KAREN
What are you talking about?
23.
HANK
I’ve prayed for this. Look, I’m sure we
can all agree on the fact that guys are
by and large assholes. I for one am
happy that she prefers the fairer sex.
Looks like I’m the proud parent of a
lesbian.
(pumps his fist)
Yes!
KAREN
Unbelievable...
HANK
What, you’re ashamed of our gay daughter?
When did you become such a homophobe?
KAREN
I am not a homophobe!
PENNY
Okay -- hold on a second here, folks.
Becca is not a lesbian.
HANK
(disappointed)
She’s not...?
PENNY
Based on what I’ve seen, no.
HANK
So why are we discussing her sexuality?
PENNY
Because she seems to have very recently
discovered the attention of boys.
KAREN
Well, she is beautiful.
HANK
Yeah, she takes after her mother.
(off Karen’s look)
The make-up and slutty clothes.
PENNY
Look, I don’t want to make a big deal
about this, but I caught her making out
with this boy last week, and he was...
HANK
(furious)
What?!
PENNY
Feeling her up.
24.
HANK
(rising)
Where is he? I’ll fucking kill him.
KAREN
Sit down, Hank.
PENNY
Look, the only reason I bring it up is
that when I told her that it wasn’t
appropriate behavior, she said, “Well,
how else do you get boys to like you?”
Hank and Karen sit in silence for a beat.
HANK
Like I said -- she takes after her
mother.
EXT. WESTSIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - DAY
Hank and Karen walk out in mid-argument.
HANK
I’ll talk to her.
KAREN
No. You’ll just get mad. And that’s
just going to make it worse.
HANK
Yeah, you talk to her. She’ll end up
pregnant. And that’ll make everything
fine and fucking dandy.
KAREN
Oh my God -- you’re such a fucking prick.
HANK
What, I’m not allowed to worry about her,
too?
KAREN
Sure you are. But you’re not allowed to
criticize every parental move I make.
Hank climbs into his car.
HANK
Whatever.
KAREN
What the hell happened to you, by the
way?
HANK
This chick... she punched me in the face.
25.
KAREN
Why?
HANK
I don't know. We were having sex. Some
fairly tremendous sex, if you ask me.
There I was, about to pop. And what does
she do? She hauls off and socks me in
the kisser.
KAREN
You’re disgusting.
He shakes his head, mock-sad.
HANK
Oh, Karen... you used to mean that in a
good way.
KAREN
You know, you would think, the one day I
actually need something from you, the one
day we have to present a united front for
our daughter, you could manage to get it
together.
HANK
Yeah, you would think, right?
That said, he drives off.
INT. HAL’S IN VENICE - NIGHT
Dark in a good way. Crowded. The cool and the beautiful
buzzing. Hank’s at the bar with his best friend and agent,
CHARLIE, a slick guy in a slick suit.
CHARLIE
So I have an offer for you.
Hank chokes on his filthy martini.
HANK
Forgive me. Haven’t heard that one in a
while.
CHARLIE
Don’t get too excited.
HANK
Shit. I wish you would have told me that
before the blood started rushing to my
cock.
CHARLIE
Are you familiar with spank.com?
26.
HANK
No, but given my fondness for internet
porn, I feel like I should.
CHARLIE
Mind out of the gutter, porn boy. Spank
is a high-brow pop culture literary salon
of sorts.
HANK
I see.
CHARLIE
They want you to blog for them.
HANK
Fuck me. Must be my trick ear. I
thought you said something about a blog.
CHARLIE
Hear me out. Given your reputation as a
cocksman nonpareil... not to mention the
fact that you’ve become something akin to
the Axl Rose of the literary world...
they are very interested in your thoughts
on writing and fucking at the very edge
of western civilization. If you have
any, that is.
A long beat as Hank polishes off his martini.
HANK
Well, I did have this really hot dream
about a nun the other night.
CHARLIE
A nun?
HANK
Full habit, headdress and everything.
CHARLIE
Well, it doesn’t take Freud to figure
that one out.
(off his look)
Hank. Please. We’ve established that
you have a certain predilection for the
company of unavailable women....
HANK
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
CHARLIE
And what would be the ultimate
manifestation of such a fetish? Perhaps
having sexual relations with a woman who
is essentially married to God.
27.
Hank takes a moment to think about it.
HANK
Couldn't it just be that it’s naughty?
Charlie laughs.
CHARLIE
You know what you need, Hank? You need
to meet a nice girl.
HANK
A nice girl? Shit, I wouldn’t even know
what to say to a nice girl at this point.
CHARLIE
Well, seeing as you’re about ten seconds
away from sitting down to dinner with
one, you better figure something out.
Hank freezes. Stares daggers at his friend.
HANK
You didn't.
CHARLIE
We most certainly did.
HANK
That is decidedly uncool.
And that’s when Charlie’s smart and sexy wife MARCY shows up,
a friend in tow. An attractive twentysomething. MEREDITH.
Nice body, cute smile -- perfectly acceptable. Marcy hugs
Hank hello. Gives him a shit-eating grin.
MARCY
Hank, I'd like you to meet Meredith.
A moment. All eyes on Hank. He smiles. Summons something
resembling charm from deep, deep within. Extends a hand.
HANK
Hank Moody, nice to meet you.
INT. HAL’S - LATER
They're at a table now. Hank finishes his drink, signals a
passing waiter. Charlie and Marcy exchange a look.
MEREDITH
So, Hank...
HANK
Yes, Meredith?
28.
MEREDITH
What do you do?
HANK
Well, Meredith, I used to be a writer.
Once upon a time. In a little place
called New York City.
MEREDITH
I’ve heard of it.
CHARLIE
(to Meredith)
He's still a writer.
MARCY
A great writer.
HANK
No. See. That's where you're wrong. A
writer writes. Me, not so much.
Nothing. Nada.
MEREDITH
Well, have you written anything I
might've read?
HANK
Well, that depends on whether or not you
read, Meredith.
MEREDITH
(irritated)
I read. Hank.
HANK
Excellent. Cheers. Well, I wrote a book
that was published a few years back.
“God Hates Us All,” it was called.
Catchy title, eh?
CHARLIE
Which was subsequently made into a movie
called --
HANK
(wincing)
-- Don't say it. Please don't say it.
MARCY
(loving it)
"A Crazy Little Thing Called Love."
Hank sags, disgusted. Meredith lights up.
MEREDITH
The one with Reese and Ryan?! I just saw
that.
29.
(MORE)
(sing-song)
Loved it!
HANK
That’s just... swell.
MEREDITH
Such a sweet movie! Congrats, Hank!
That's so cool! You must be so proud.
HANK
Oh, like you wouldn’t believe.
A waiter arrives with a drink. Hank takes a healthy swig.
The table falls into silence. Charlie and Marcy trading
looks. Not going so well. Not at all.
Marcy KICKS Hank under the table, encouraging him to make
small talk. Hank smiles. Looks at Meredith.
HANK
So, Meredith, tell me a little about
yourself.
MEREDITH
What do you want to know?
HANK
How 'bout the Cliff Notes?
Meredith smiles, game. Charlie and Marcy are optimistic.
MEREDITH
Well --
But then Hank cuts in --
HANK
Wait. Let me try. You grew up in the
Valley. Nice part, though. Calabasas,
Hidden Hills, something like that. Your
father was middle-management. An
executive type. You didn't want to stray
too far from your family so you went to
SC. Maybe UCLA. No, SC. You had a
serous boyfriend in college. You broke
up right after. You put on some weight.
Got a low-maintenance gig in the Human
Resources industry. You had a string of
bad relationships, decided it was time to
lose the l.b.'s because your friends were
starting to get married and you didn't
want to be too far behind. So you joined
a gym. Got addicted.
30.
MEREDITH (CONT'D)
(MORE)
You say you want to work, maybe start
your own party-planning business -- you
fancy yourself a poor gal's Martha
Stewart -- but what you really want to do
is find some poor sap to sit on the couch
with you while you watch reality TV and
get fat again. Sorry, honey, I ain't
that guy.
(off her look)
Okay, right now? You're giving me that
look -- that look that says you think I'm
an asshole, but what you're really
thinking is, 'If I manage to get out of
here in the next ten minutes, I might be
able to make it home in time for “Next
Top Model.” Good luck with that.
Hank kills his drink, slams it down on the table. Stunned
silence. A moment.
Maintaining as much of her dignity as humanly possible,
Meredith rises, grabs her bag and walks off.
Charlie glares at Hank.
CHARLIE
You're a real prick, you know that?
HANK
Guilty as charged.
MARCY
(to Charlie)
Why don't you walk her to her car?
Charlie gets up, throws his napkin down on the seat, furious
with Hank. Charlie heads off after Meredith. A moment.
HANK
Okay, let's get it over with. Bring it
on, baby. Bring it on.
MARCY
What?
HANK
Pummel me. Let's go.
MARCY
I'm not going to do that, Hank. You're
harder on yourself than anyone else could
ever be.
HANK
Accuracy?
MARCY
Good. I'd say about eighty-five percent.
(off his smile)
31.
HANK (CONT'D)
(MORE)
Which doesn't make her a bad person,
Hank.
HANK
You're right. I'm sorry.
MARCY
Too late for that, sweetie.
Hank sits quietly for a moment.
HANK
Do you ever think about it?
MARCY
(wary)
Think about what?
HANK
You know... that time. The year after
college. When you and Charlie were on
one of your breaks and I hadn't met Karen
yet.
Marcy smiles, uneasy.
MARCY
Sure. I mean, not all the time. But I'd
be lying if I said it didn't make an
appearance every once in a while.
(then)
It's a nice memory, Hank.
HANK
Yeah, it is.
(smiles)
I wish there was a way --
MARCY
(cutting him off)
It's a nice memory, Hank. A memory.
Watch it. You're dangerously close to
hitting on your best friend's wife. Do
you really want to go there?
HANK
Well, when you put it like that...
MARCY
Go home, honey. Sleep it off.
Tomorrow's another day.
Marcy kisses him on the cheek. Gets up. Walks off. Hank
sits there. Just sits there. The Waiter walks up.
WAITER
Another round...?
32.
MARCY (CONT'D)
HANK
(shakes his head)
I think I should just quit while...
He looks around, makes eye contact with a HOT WOMAN on a
blind date. The date gets up to go to the bathroom. The
woman smiles at Hank.
Hank, in turn, smiles at the Waiter.
HANK
Sure. Fuck it. Why not?
INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Hank and Hot Woman. Fucking. She’s on top. About to cum.
Suddenly, Hank gets scared. Covers his face.
HOT WOMAN
What’s wrong?
HANK
I thought you were going to hit me.
HOT WOMAN
Why would I do that?
Beat.
HANK
No reason.
She smiles. They kiss. She slides off of him. Gets down on
all fours. Looks back at him. Smiling.
HOT WOMAN
Defile me.
Beat. Hank nods grimly.
HANK
Right on.
His cell phone rings. Killing the moment. He checks the
number. It’s Karen. It’s late. Weird that she’s calling.
HANK
I gotta take this. Sorry.
Hot Woman bristles. Hank answers.
HANK
Yeah, not the best time...
(then, alarmed)
What?! Where is she? I’m on my way.
33.
Hank grabs his clothes. Takes off running. The woman yells
after him:
HOT WOMAN
Are you fucking kidding me?!
EXT. KAREN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Hank pulls to a stop in front of a mammoth North of Montana
home. Karen’s waiting for him. She gets in. He tears off.
INSIDE THE CAR
HANK
Where to?
KAREN
Somewhere up in the Palisades.
HANK
Who took her?
KAREN
Bill’s daughter.
HANK
What? I didn’t even know he had a
daughter. How old is she?
KAREN
Sixteen.
HANK
And you let Becca hang out with her?
Beat. Karen sniffs the air.
HANK
What?
KAREN
You smell like pussy.
Beat. Hank drives off.
EXT. PALISADES PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
Parents are away. Kids are playing. Hard. Hank pulls up on
the lawn, almost taking out a few teenagers. He gets out,
followed by Karen.
INT. PARTY HOUSE
Kids everywhere. Drunk, stoned and coked out of their
brains. Hip-hop blasting on a ridiculously high-end stereo.
An all-out assault on the senses.
34.
SOME DRUNK KID, booze-emboldened, tries to stop them.
DRUNK KID
Hey, man...
Hank grabs him by the shirt --
HANK
Becca Moody -- where is she?
DRUNK KID
(gulp)
Upstairs. I think.
Hank tosses him aside. Takes the stairs two at a time.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Hank yanks open a bedroom door. Two teens fucking.
HE BOLTS IN
Looks closer. Not Becca. Thank god.
HANK
As you were.
BACK TO THE HALLWAY
Tries another door. Locked. Kicks it open. Two teens.
Making out on the bed. Getting serious. This time it’s for
real. Becca and some FUTURE FRATBOY on the make. Becca’s
got her shirt off. Just her bra.
Hank freaks. Runs into
THE BEDROOM
And proceeds to kick the living shit out of the guy.
Punching, kicking, slapping. An ugly, embarrassing display
of fury. If the movie theater scene was funny, this is
disturbing. Karen tries to pull him off, all to no avail.
Finally, Becca screams:
BECCA
Daddy!!!
Which snaps him out of it. He stops his pounding. Looks
down. The kid is a bloody mess on the floor. Not dead or
anything -- just a good solid beating.
Becca rushes over, and for just a second, almost as if by
reflex, Hank opens his arms to receive her, but alas it’s not
to be... she runs straight for the boy.
In that one second, Hank is crushed. He looks at Karen.
35.
And for once, they’re thinking the same thing. Something
approaching empathy passes between them.
INT./EXT. PORSCHE - NIGHT
Hank pulls up in front of the North of Montana house.
Karen’s next to him. Becca’s in the back, not talking to
either of them. A beat. Hank looks back.
HANK
Becca... look...
A beat. Becca fixes him with an icy gaze.
BECCA
I hate you.
That said, she gets out of the car, runs into the house.
Hank sags, a dagger through the heart. Karen looks at him,
sympathizes.
HANK
Guess I deserve that.
KAREN
No one deserves that.
(then)
Wanna come in?
HANK
What about...?
KAREN
He’s out of town.
A beat. Hank nods.
KAREN
But only if you wash the pussy off.
HANK
Deal.
INT. KAREN & BILL’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Hank washes up in a luxurious bathroom. Looks in the mirror.
Doesn’t much like what he sees looking back. He opens the
medicine cabinet. Finds a bottle of Perocet. Pops a couple.
IN THE HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
Hank walks down the hallway. Stops at his daughter’s room.
She’s on her bed, back to him. He’s unsure whether or not he
should walk in. She picks up a remote. Presses a button.
The door shuts in his face.
36.
IN THE KITCHEN
Hank, Karen and coffee.
HANK
Well, that happened.
KAREN
Yeah, and it was going to happen sooner
or later.
HANK
So you’re saying I was wrong?
KAREN
You did exactly what I wanted to do.
Which still doesn’t make it right.
HANK
I just reacted.
KAREN
Yeah... well... you’ve always been a
walking id, Hank.
HANK
Which, oddly enough, is the title of my
next novel.
KAREN
What next novel?
HANK
What are we talking about here? Our
daughter or my writing?
KAREN
Kind of the same thing, isn’t it?
HANK
Hey, you called me.
KAREN
Your daughter didn’t come home. I
thought you should know.
HANK
Bullshit. You were alone. You wanted me
to handle it.
KAREN
You say that like it’s a bad thing. I
want you in my life, Hank.
HANK
(teases)
Because you love me. Because you want to
have like ten-thousand more of my babies.
37.
KAREN
(rolls her eyes)
Because how Becca turns out is our
responsibility. Like it or not, we’re
tied to each other for life.
HANK
Minus the obvious sexual benefits.
KAREN
Oh, I’m sure I couldn’t hold a candle to
the multidude of skanks that have come
along since.
HANK
Hey, don’t sell yourself short. If I
remember correctly, our problems didn’t
extend to the bedroom.
A hint of a smile from Karen. Which pleases Hank to no end.
And then -- the SOUND of the front door slamming. Footsteps.
A girl walks into the kitchen. A pretty girl. And if she
looks familiar, it’s because we’ve met her before.
Hank chokes. Spills coffee all over. Jumps to his feet.
HANK
Fuck!!!
The girl is Mia.
From the book store. From the coffee shop. She of the
fucking and the punching.
Fuck indeed.
MIA
I am so sorry. Are you okay?
KAREN
Hank, this is Bill’s daughter, Mia.
Stunned silence from Hank. Mia smiles. Karen takes it in.
KAREN
Do you two know each other...?
MIA
Well...
HANK
No -- we do not know each other.
MIA
...I do recognize you.
38.
HANK
No, you don’t --
MIA
Sure I do...
(then)
From your book. Your picture’s on the
back.
HANK
Oh, I see...
Karen’s already moved on --
KAREN
What happened tonight, Mia?
MIA
Look, I told her to be careful. I told
her to pace herself. I told her to stay
away from that guy, but there’s only so
much one gal can do, you know?
KAREN
Well, at least you called. I appreciate
that.
MIA
How is she?
KAREN
She hates us. She’s fine.
MIA
(to Hank)
That was cool. What you did to that guy.
He’s a fucking asshole.
KAREN
Mia...
MIA
What? He is.
(then)
I’m going to bed. Nice to meet you,
Hank.
Mia skips off. A beat.
HANK
She seems... nice.
KAREN
She is, actually. A good kid.
HANK
How, um, old is she?
39.
KAREN
Sixteen.
HANK
Sixteen. Wow.
KAREN
I know what you’re thinking.
HANK
What?
KAREN
That she’s ridiculously beautiful.
HANK
Really? I hadn’t noticed.
KAREN
Give me a break, Hank. Your jaw was
practically on the floor. Fucking dirty
old man.
INT. HANK’S CONDO - NIGHT
A stoned and stupefied Hank sprawls on his black leather
sofa, highball glass in hand, bottle of Grey Goose down on
the floor by his feet.
He eyes his glowing laptop, sitting atop the kitchen table.
After a moment, he hauls himself off the couch. Walks over.
Circling the laptop. Finally sits down. Starts writing.
HANK (V.O.)
So here we are... at the edge of the
world... the very edge of Western
Civilization... so desperate to feel
something... anything... that we keep
falling into each other... fucking our
way towards the end of days.
As HANK’S VOICE continues OVER, we pull up and out of the
condo, revealing Santa Monica, the beach, and beyond...
HANK (V.O.)
Rome is burning... we’re hurtling towards
an uncertain future... and here I stand,
knee deep in a river of pussy. They say
the heart wants what the heart wants, but
what happens when the only thing the
heart gets is what the dick wants...? I
don’t know the answer, but I think it’s
high time I try to figure it out...
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:
1 EXT. MAIN ST. - DAY 1
A familiar dirty black Porsche cruises down Main St. in
Venice... a charmingly bedraggled HANK MOODY at the wheel.
He stops at the light where Main meets Rose.
He stares up the giant ballerina clown atop the building
there, contemplative.
He feels a hand on his thigh. He looks -- Karen is next to
him. Smiling. The ray of sunshine to his dark cloud.
KAREN
What are you thinking about?
HANK
How much I absolutely fucking
loathe this city.
KAREN
Just as I was thinking about how
much I absolutely love it.
HANK
Meanwhile, I haven’t written a
goddamn word since we got here.
KAREN
Relax. Blame it on the weather.
HANK
That’s how it starts: with the
weather. Then, before you know it,
you’re smoking the Hollywood crack
pipe and sucking dick to support
your habit.
KAREN
Well, at least you’re not being
dramatic about it.
HANK
What can I say? I miss New York.
KAREN
And I miss you. Because you’re
still there. In that big, thick
head of yours. Come back to us,
Hank. Your girls miss you...
(CONTINUED)
She smiles. Which makes it impossible for Hank not to kiss
her. A car horn HONKS, napalming the moment. Hank is yanked
from his reverie. He’s alone in the car.
He looks -- sees a gorgeous California blonde in the
convertible next to him. Smiling. The postcard-worthy
promise of a better day. She’s been watching, bemused.
THE BLONDE
Who are you talking to?
HANK
Sorry. Professional hazard.
THE BLONDE
What do you do?
HANK
Me? I’m a writer. Non-practicing. *
THE BLONDE
Who isn’t? Here, maybe you could *
read something of mine.
She flies a paper airplane into his car. Zips off. Hank
unfolds the paper: “CALL ME.” Followed by a phone number.
Hank smiles, shakes his head.
As he drives off, we cut to MAIN TITLES.
2 EXT./INT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - DAY 2
Hank pulls up in front of the cover of Dwell magazine.
Today is a day he would very much prefer to honk the horn,
but he decides to suck it up and ring the doorbell.
And so he does, bracing himself for the very real possibility
that a certain comely 16-year-old might answer.
The door opens, revealing not Mia but her sire, BILL, an
annoyingly handsome and seemingly decent fellow who also just
happens to be Hank’s nemesis.
BILL
Hank.
HANK
Bob.

BILL
Bill.
HANK
Really?
BILL
Becca doesn’t want to see you.
HANK
Are you looking for a cock punch?
Let me talk to her.
BILL
Hank, trust me, as the father of a
teenage daughter, just give her
some space. She’ll come around.
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 2A.
2 CONTINUED: 2
(CONTINUED)
Hank shakes his head, starts to walk away, turns back. Walks
past Bill, into the house...
HANK
You know... Bill, is it?
BILL
Yep -- still Bill.
HANK
I appreciate the parenting advice,
but maybe -- just maybe -- it’s not
such a great idea to give your kid
too much space. Maybe too much
space is what gets them in trouble.
BILL
Hank. Please. My daughter is
sixteen. She’s an angel. Clearly
I’m doing something right.
HANK
You poor bastard.
BILL
Excuse me?
HANK
Homo says what?
BILL
What?
HANK
Gotcha.
Bill is stunned by the inanity of it all. Hank notices a
recently unpacked painting leaning somewhere nearby. It’s
hideous -- absurdly expensive and completely pretentious.
HANK
What the fuck is that?
BILL
What do you think? I could’ve
bought a new car instead.
HANK
I think you should still buy the
car. And run over whoever painted
this. It’s fucking hideous.
H.I.D. Positive.
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 3.

(CONTINUED)
Karen appears.
KAREN
Everything okay out here, boys?
BILL
It’s all good.
HANK
“It’s all good”? Really? Not
exactly the King’s English there,
fella.
Hank moves in to give Karen a kiss hello. As is his wont.
But Karen dodges the kiss. As is her wont. Bill, in turn,
kisses Karen, eyeballing Hank the whole time.
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 3A.
2 CONTINUED: 2
(CONTINUED)
Becca appears. Deadpans Hank.
BECCA
I still hate you.
HANK
Naturally.
BECCA
But I do want to see your movie.
HANK
My book. Not my movie.
BECCA
Not my problem. I like your movie.
HANK
How is that even possible?
BECCA
Because it proves you’re not the
asshole they say you are.
Hank holds out his palm. Becca produces a dollar bill.
Which Hank quickly pockets.
HANK
Now who says I’m an asshole?
An awkward moment as looks are exchanged. Becca deadpans.
Hank is forced to give her the dollar back. Hank starts to
lead Becca away, but Karen interjects:
KAREN
(to Hank)
Hey, can we swap nights this
weekend? We’re having some people
over on Saturday and we’d love
Becca to be there.
BECCA
Uncle Charlie and Aunt Marcy.

KAREN

Thank you, sweetie.
BECCA
Dad should come. They’re his
friends too, you know. And Uncle
Charlie’s his agent. Maybe he has
an offer for him.
Karen and Bill exchange looks. Much to Hank’s amusement.
Bill, nothing if not a decent guy, summons the decency:
BILL
You’re welcome to come, Hank.
KAREN
Absolutely. Bring a date.
HANK
(to Becca)
Earbuds.
Becca dutifully inserts the earbuds, cranks her iPod.
HANK
(to Karen)
First of all, you could never
handle me hitting it off with
someone right in front of you.
KAREN
I’ll do my best.
HANK
I guess this means the answer is
no. You’re not going to marry me.
I have to say -- I’m disappointed.
BILL
Hank, I’m standing right here.
KAREN
Did you ever stop and think that it
might be nice for Becca to see us
all getting along for a change?

HANK
Hey, it’d be nice if I could
fellate myself while farting the
White Album, but I haven’t quite
mastered that yet either.
Becca removes her earbuds, looks at Karen.
BECCA
Is he coming?
All eyes on Hank.
HANK
Absolutely. What can I bring?

4 INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - DAY 4
Outside Charlie’s office, his assistant, DANI, answers calls.
She’s quiet, fragile and oddly beautiful. Maggie Gyllenhaal
in “Secretary” meets a pierced, tattooed Suicide Girl.
DANI
Charlie Runkle’s office. He’s in a
meeting. We’ll try you back....
WE MOVE INSIDE...
...and find Hank reclined on the sofa as Charlie finishes up
a call and answers an e-mail.
HANK
Your assistant makes me want to
touch myself in a bad place.
CHARLIE
That’s nice -- because my assistant
makes we want to hang myself.
HANK
While masturbating?
CHARLIE
Are you retarded or something?
HANK
Funky tat on the small of the back.
You know what that means.
(off his look)
She likes it in the pooper.

CHARLIE
Really?
HANK
I have no idea. I just wanted to
say pooper. But I have found the
back-tat to be a watermark of the
promiscuous.
CHARLIE
Good for you. Doesn’t change the
fact that she’s the world’s worst
assistant. Drops calls, loses
manuscripts -- she can’t even get
my fucking macchiato right.
HANK
But she does seem to have a nipple
ring. Quite possibly two.
Seriously -- something very cool is
going on in that area.
CHARLIE
Enough already. Move on. How’s
the book coming?
HANK
Now there’s a hostile question.
CHARLIE
Hank. You’ve owed a book to your
publisher since Becca was breastfeeding.
I remember because I
liked to watch Karen do that.
HANK
You’re supposed to be my agent -- I
need your encouragement, support,
nurturing. Not some creepy comment
about your lactating-lady fetish.
CHARLIE
You need a fucking job.
HANK
Okay. What do you got for me?
CHARLIE
Shhh. Listen. You hear that?
HANK
What?

That’s the sound of the phone not

with my bare hands. Except, of
course --
HANK
-- Don’t say it. Don’t you say it.
CHARLIE
Hell-A magazine. They still want
you to blog for them. Just take
the fucking meeting already.
Dani walks in with a grande something from Starbucks and a
pile of manuscripts. Charlie drinks, curses.
HANK
Let’s ask Dani California.
(to Dani)
Hell-A magazine. Thoughts?
DANI
You’d be perfect for them.
HANK
Nipple ring?
(off her nod)
Two?
(another nod)
Anywhere else?
She smiles, walks out. Hank gives Charlie a knowing look.
HANK
Nose ring too. You know what
means.
CHARLIE
What? She likes it in the nose?
HANK
What does that even mean? Are you
retarded or something?

NORA
Use the blog, Hank. Channel your

heart, balls and swagger. Not some
fucking pansy-ass metrosexual.
HANK
Look, I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but the truth is... I’ve got
nothing to say. I’m between books
at the moment --
NORA
-- Yes, Hank, when is “Chinese
Democracy” going to be finished?
HANK
Fuck you very much.
Nora digs into her purse. Produces a business card.
NORA
Think about it.
HANK
Hey, where ya going? I’m the last
of a dying breed. A real writer.
A real man. Heart, balls and
swagger, remember?
NORA
You’re cute, Hank. I totally get

Sounds kinda gay.
NORA

NORA
Then I’ll let you in on a little
secret: I’m a sucker for wellcrafted
prose. Write me something.
Because who knows where those words
will take you...?
Nora leaves Hank all horned-up with no place to go. He slips
the card in his pocket, feels something else in there. Pulls
out the paper with the blonde’s number on it.
6 INT. A CONDO SOMEWHERE - NIGHT 6
Hank and The Blonde kiss and tear clothes off as they make
their way towards the bed...
THE BLONDE
What do you think?
HANK
Very little of substance.
THE BLONDE
Come on. My tits. Seriously.
HANK
I don’t know... they look pretty
fucking groovy to me.

HANK
Are you kidding me?! They’re
practically perfect in every way.
THE BLONDE
What about my lips?
Hank kisses her.
HANK
Highly kissable.
THE BLONDE
Not those, silly.
She looks down. Hank follows her gaze.
HANK
Oh. What about them?
THE BLONDE
Do you think they’re too flappy?
HANK
Flappy?
THE BLONDE
Yeah, I’ve been thinking about
getting them fixed.
HANK
Fixed?
THE BLONDE
Vaginal rejuvenation. Get them
trimmed a little. So they don’t
hang down like day-old deli meat.
HANK
I think I just lost my manhood.
THE BLONDE
Well, let me help you find it.
She proceeds to go down on him. Sucking and slurping like a
vacuum cleaner on steroids. Gagging and spitting with glee.

As Hank’s eyes adjust to the apartment, he notices a
collection of porn DVD’s. He picks one up. It’s a parody of
his own movie: “Crazy Little Thing Called Anal.”
Then he realizes that the girl blowing him is the same as the
one on the box. Pretty much the same angle and everything.
HANK
Hey, this is you.
THE BLONDE
Yeah, I thought you recognized me.
HANK
Not a big porn guy, actually.
All of a sudden, there’s the sound of a KID CRYING from a
BABY MONITOR. Followed by a “Mommy!” or two. Hank freezes.
HANK
Who might that be?
THE BLONDE
That would be my daughter.
HANK
Oh. Do you need to...?
THE BLONDE
Nah, she’ll quiet down in a minute.
Mommy’s gotta get laid sometime.
But the kid continues to cry. Overcome with great sadness,
Hank gently guides The Blonde’s head up and away from his
southern hemisphere. Gives her a kiss on the cheek.
HANK
Go be with your kid.
He collects his stuff and leaves.
7 INT. HANK’S PLACE - NIGHT 7
Hank lies awake in bed. Grabs his pants off the floor and
fishes for the card Nora gave him. He picks up his shitty PC
laptop, launches the browser, types in the address for the
Hell-A website.
The site is instantly appealing -- a cross between Rolling
Stone, Salon.com, and Suicide Girls.com. The content covers
art, music, film, politics -- with a narrow focus on L.A.

being the very edge of Western Civilization and the epicenter
of everything right and wrong with the world as we know it.
Hank is instantly sucked into the raw, cool, unfiltered
aesthetic. We get the sense he sees a kindred spirit in
there somewhere. And then -- his computer dies.
He hurls it across the room. Gets out of bed.
8 INT. APPLE STORE - NIGHT 8
Hank stands in the middle of the sleek, ultra-tech space,
writing on one of the Macs. We see a portion of the display,
the top of which reads: “HANK HATES YOU ALL.”
As Hank’s voice-over kicks in...
HANK (V.O.)
A few things I’ve learned in my
travels through this crazy little
thing called life: One: a morning
of awkwardness is far better than a
night of loneliness. Two: I
probably won’t go down in history,
but I will go down on your sister.
And three: while I’m down there,
it might be a nice to see a hint of
pubis. I’m not talking about a
huge 70’s Playboy bush or
anything... just something that
reminds me that I’m performing
cunnilingus on an adult...
...words, phrases and images from Hank’s manifesto are
projected onto the walls and other computer displays.
Things like: “breast implants, bikini wax, vaginal
rejuvenation.”
Pictures of 1950’s pin-up girls transforming over the decades
into the alien life forms that L.A. Women have become today.
The whole store becomes Hank’s private office and a
heightened, stylized manifestation of what’s going on inside
his head.
HANK (V.O.)
But I guess the larger question
is... why is the City of Angels so
hell-bent on destroying its female
population...?

9 EXT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - DAY 9
Hank pulls up in front. Gets out with a bottle of Glenlivet.
Walks the walk. Hearing signs of life from the --
POOL AREA
Where he finds a lone swimmer in the pool:
It’s MIA, of course.
She pulls herself up and out of the pool, dripping wet,
string bikini, more naked than not. All that’s missing is a
pair of heart-shaped glasses.
HANK
Jesus Christ.
MIA
Nope. Just little ol’ me.
(then)
Are you okay? You look a little
pale. You’re not going to have a
heart attack, are you? You are
getting on in years.
HANK
Hey, being older than you doesn’t
necessarily make me old.
MIA
Well, I am sixteen, you know.
HANK
So I’ve been told.
MIA
What’s the word for that again?
Let me check the books. Oh, here
it is. Right here. Statutory
rape.
HANK
That’s two words.
Bill emerges from the house, breaking the spell. He clears
his throat, clearly uncomfortable.
BILL
Honey, go put some clothes on,
okay? We have company.

MIA
Oh, Daddy... I’m sure it’s nothing

An uncomfortable beat. She walks off. It takes everything
Hank’s got not to watch as she goes. Bill appraises Hank.
BILL
Hank.
HANK
Tim.
BILL
Thanks for coming.
HANK
Thanks for having me.
BILL
It’s my pleasure.
HANK
No, it’s my pleasure.
BILL
You know, I think this is an
important step we’re taking here
tonight.
HANK
What step is that, Bill? The one
where I stand by and let you steal
my family out from under me? I
don’t think so. Game on, broheme.
Bill sighs, reaches out to take the bottle of booze...
BILL
You didn’t have to do that.
...but Hank pulls away.
HANK
I didn’t. This is for me.
At the same time, Karen walks out with a 40ish friend and
neighbor. SONJA. Hank goes in for his customary kiss and
gets his usual rebuke.
KAREN

HANK
How much were you paid to say that?
Cuz I’ll double it for the truth.
SONJA
I read your adaptation way back
when Soderbergh was going to do it.
I fucking loved it.
HANK
Ah, yes. The salad days. There I
was, across from the man of my
dreams. You’re so in love and you
know you’re going to fuck and make
this beautiful baby. Then all of a
sudden you turn your head, and when
you look back, he’s gone, replaced
by some hack imposter. Yet you
still sleep with him because he’s
vaguely attractive and you talk
yourself into thinking he’ll be a
great father. Nine months later...
SONJA
...you wish you had sucked down a
bottle of morning-after pills.

Been there, bought the T-shirt.
HANK
Oh, we’re going to get along just
fine.

Excuse me for a moment.
Hank smoothly tugs Karen out of earshot.

HANK
And you need to get in touch with
your emotions, woman.
10 INT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - BATHROOM - EVENING 10
Hank opens the medicine cabinet, finds a bottle of Percocet.
Pops one. Closes the cabinet. Looks in the mirror. Doesn’t
like what he sees. Gives himself a quick pep talk.
HANK
Nobody likes you. You’re ugly and
your mother dresses you funny.
(then)
Smile, you fucking douche.
11 EXT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - EVENING 11
An infinitely more relaxed Hank finds everyone gathered at
the table. Bill at one end -- Karen at the other. Charlie,
Marcy and Becca lined up on one side.
Hank finds himself forced to slide between Sonja and Mia on
the other. Almost immediately, he feels a hand on his leg.
He looks -- it’s Sonja. He looks at her. She’s smiling.
He looks away, catches Karen’s gaze. Somehow she
instinctively senses the chemistry between Hank and Sonja.
Hank can’t help but smile. And then he feels something.
Another hand on his leg. Looks down...
It’s Mia’s. He looks at her. She’s smiling too. He looks
away, catches Bill staring at him. Becca pipes in:
BECCA

HANK
Yes, my love.

Hank winces, doesn’t like the “honey.” Bill realizes.
BILL
Sorry, Hank. My apologies.
HANK
No worries. She is very sweet.
Nervous laughter. Bill clears his throat, raises a glass.
BILL
Allow me to propose a toast. To
friends, family, a new beginning...
Under the table, Mia has found Hank’s dick.
MIA
And a happy ending.
BILL
Well said, honey. Cheers.
Everyone drinks up. Hank drains his entire glass, squirming
in his seat as Mia grinds him hard. Sonja continues to
stroke Hank’s inner thigh, oblivious to the tugjob action.
SONJA
(to Karen)
So how did you and Bill meet?
Karen is immediately uncomfortable.
KAREN
Probably not the best setting for
that particular story...
HANK
Are you kidding me? Couldn’t ask
for a better setting. Bill hired
Karen to redo his place. This
place. Along the way, they talked
Zen and the art of the mid-life
crisis and fell head over heels.

A bit of an oversimplification,
Hank, but I’m not surprised.
HANK

HANK

What was it called again?
HANK
CBGB’s.
BECCA
Right. He thought she was
pretentious, and she thought he was
way too pleased with himself. But
they had sex anyway. In the
morning, he made her breakfast and
she talked about her plan to move
to Seattle so she could stalk and
marry...
KAREN
...Chris Cornell.
BECCA
Right. But then she read Dad’s
writing. And that was it. Nine
months later, I was born. They
never got married, of course. But
they stayed together a long time.
A lot longer than most people do.
No one knows what to say. Hank smiles sweetly at Becca.
Looks at Karen, who is dodging both his look and Bill’s.
Marcy feels like it’s her civic duty to change the tone.
MARCY
Not that anyone asked, but I can
tell you how Charlie and I met.
CHARLIE
Here we go.
MARCY
One day, this obnoxious agent

“Hot Lips.” Stop by and pamper the

A car horn HONKS out front.
MIA
Bye, Daddy. Bye everyone. My

Mia gives Hank’s cock a final squeeze and gets up from the

daughter. What else is there?
MARCY
What about Hank?
KAREN
What about him?
MARCY
He loves you. He’s trying to get
his shit together.

(CONTINUED)
KAREN
He’s been trying to get his shit
together since the day we met.
MARCY
Sex with Bill? Good?
KAREN
Great.
MARCY
As great as it was with Hank?
KAREN
Different.
16 INT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 16
Where Hank teases an uber-enthused Sonja from behind.
SONJA
Come on... just put it in...
HANK
I don’t think Tom and Katie would
approve of your behavior right now.
SONJA
Oh shut the fuck up already...
HANK
Are you clear yet?
SONJA
Shut up and fuck me!
HANK
You are one kinky thetan.
As Hank accommodates her, Sonja’s ardor grows... and
grows... until finally... after a particularly forceful
series of thrusts from Hank... she BUCKS against him... and
BRONCOS him...
In the process, Hank is thrown backward, against the wall.
Taking down the absurdly modern painting that hangs there.
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 27.
15 CONTINUED: 15
(CONTINUED)
Off the bed he falls, SMASHING his head against the edge of
the night stand on the way down. Landing on the floor like a
sack of grain.
SONJA
Oh my God -- are you okay?!
A beat later, Hank staggers to his feet. He touches his
head, comes away with bloody fingers. He sees the painting.
Tries to put it back up on the wall.
Getting blood all over it in the process.
Suddenly, he’s not feeling so good. The combination of pot,
Percocet and single malt Scotch whisky is taking its toll.
A moment later, he VOMITS all over the painting.
And that’s precisely when Karen, Bill, Charlie and Marcy all
pile into the room, drawn by the commotion.
A horribly embarrassing moment as Hank stands there -- naked,
bloody and dazed. Suddenly feeling vulnerable, Hank picks up
the painting and holds it in front of his genitalia.
HANK
It’s all good...
17 EXT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - NIGHT 17
As Hank exits and walks to his car, another car pulls up,
depositing Mia. She slams the door and the car roars off.
Mia sees Hank. Takes in his disheveled state, very amused.
MIA
Did we just have sex?
HANK
Cute. Did you hit him too?
MIA
Of course not, silly. That was
just for you. He was pissed off
that I wouldn’t surrender the pink.
Boys...
(alt) *
He was just pissed off that I *
wouldn’t give so much as a dry *
tugjob. Boys... *
HANK
What do you want from me?
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 28.
16 CONTINUED: 16
(CONTINUED)
MIA
Isn’t it obvious?
HANK
Look, what happened the other night
can never happen again. Ever.
MIA
And why is that?
HANK
Because it’s sick and wrong.
MIA
Are you sure about that?
HANK
Yes. Absolutely.
MIA
Maybe I’m in the minority here, but
I don’t see what’s so sick and
wrong about a little fucking and
punching between consenting adults.
HANK
Well, for one -- you’re not an
adult.
MIA
You dirty old man you.
(sighs)
Oh, well... I guess I’ll just have
to get out my vibrator and read *
your blog.
HANK
Well, at least it won’t be a total *
waste of your time. *
MIA
No way. I thought it was cool. I
was like, hey, I totally fucked
that guy.
(then)
Must be weird, though...
HANK
What?
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 29.
17 CONTINUED: 17
(CONTINUED)
MIA
Being an employee of a man you so
clearly hate.
HANK
What are you talking about?
MIA
My father. He owns Hell-A
magazine.
As if on cue, the front door opens... Bill calls out:
BILL (O.S.)
Mia... is that you...?
CALIFORNICATION EP102 FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07 29A.
17 CONTINUED: 17
(CONTINUED)
MIA
(to Bill, eyes on Hank)
Coming, Daddy...
She turns and goes, leaving Hank dazed, confused, and no
closer to redemption...
18 INT./EXT. DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE - NIGHT 18
Hank drives along the coast...
HANK (V.O.)
As a boy, I was obsessed with
girls. All I wanted was
everything. To kiss them, taste
them, smell them... but most of
all... to understand them...
19 INT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - BECCA’S ROOM - NIGHT 19
In a darkened room, Karen kisses a sleeping Becca...
HANK (V.O.)
As an adult, these girls... these
amazing creatures... they remain a
mystery...
20 INT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - MIA’S ROOM - NIGHT 20
A pajama-clad Mia reads in bed -- God Hates Us All by Hank
Moody. Finally, she puts the book down, slips her hand into
her bottoms and begins to masturbate...
HANK (V.O.)
All I know for sure is that they
become women...
21 EXT. KAREN & BILL’S PLACE - BY THE POOL - NIGHT 21
A contemplative Karen drinks a glass of wine by the pool...
HANK (V.O.)
And the things women do... to each
other... to themselves... in this
city... in the name of men... it
makes me sad. If only they knew...
if only they could see... that
their flaws make them all the more
beautiful... I think they would
sleep a lot easier...

22 INT./EXT. DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE - NIGHT 22
Hank reclines in the Porsche, looking up the sky, the top
down, parked somewhere near LAX.
He feels a hand on his thigh. Looks: Karen is next to him.
She mouths something... something that sounds like...
KAREN
I love you...
But he can barely hear her...
A MAGNIFICENT ROAR as A PLANE FLIES LOW OVERHEAD...
Coming in for a landing...
Hank watches for a moment. Looks back. Karen is gone.
HANK (V.O.)
They say this is the City of
Angels... but all I see are broken
wings...

FADE IN:
1 INT. LAX - DAY 1
HANK and BECCA wait at the gate. Hank enduring the sullen
treatment. Boarding is announced. Hank rises. Tugs Becca
to her feet.
HANK
Off you go, young lady. Into the
wild blue yonder.
BECCA
Great. Maybe I’ll get lucky and my
plane will explode in midair.
HANK
Thank you for that lovely image.
BECCA
You’d be sad.
HANK
That I would.
BECCA
For sending me against my will.
HANK
I don’t get it, Becs. What could
possibly be so awful about visiting
the woman who pushed you through
her magnificent vagina? In New
York City. In the fall, no less.
You’re gonna step off that plane
into a Woody Allen movie. I’m
pretty jealous right now.
BECCA
Chelsea has Lakers tickets.
HANK
You hate basketball.
BECCA
You’re missing the point. It’s a
killer scene.
Hank sighs, defeated. He hugs and kisses his daughter
goodbye, but it’s somewhat akin to handling a wet rag doll.
HANK
I know you’re in there somewhere,
baby girl. Have a safe trip.
Not much of a response from Becca. He watches as she
surrenders her ticket and sulks onto the jetway.
HANK
(muttering to himself)
Come on... look back. At least
once. Then I’ll know you still
love me. Please, God, just give me
a sign from on high.
Finally, just before she rounds a corner and disappears from
sight, she looks back. Well, scowls is more like it. But
it’s enough. Hank waves and grins like an idiot.
HANK
That’s right! That’s what I’m
talking about!
Hank’s happy rain dance takes us all the way to MAIN TITLES.
2 INT. LAX - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY 2
Hank comes down an escalator. Headed for a baggage carousel.
His phone out. Making a call.
HANK
Okay, she’s up, up and away...
Intercut with:
3 INT. KAREN’S PLACE IN NYC - SAME 3
KAREN
Great. Can’t wait to get my hands
on that little peanut.
HANK
Don’t be too excited. She hasn’t
been very pleasant lately. Kind of
a little shit, actually.
KAREN
Stop. Don’t poison the well.
We’re going to have a great time,
she and I. I’m sure of it.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 2.
HANK
Okus-dokus. Just you wait and see.
Something wicked your way comes.
KAREN
Wish you could’ve come with.
HANK
Me too. I’m not looking forward to
this weekend.
KAREN
Hank. He’s your best friend.
HANK
Was. I haven’t seen the guy in
years. Calls me out of the blue.
Wants to come visit. Says he has
something important to tell me.
Kinda weird, no?
KAREN
Whatever. Just have fun. You’ve
been pulling Daddy Duty for months
now. Retreat into the man cave.
Have yourself a lost weekend.
HANK
I can do that.
KAREN
I know you can.
HANK
Call me when she lands. Give her a
kiss for me.
KAREN
With pleasure.
Karen hangs up. So does Hank. He looks around...
Whereupon he is suddenly TACKLED. And mock butt-fucked, too.
His assailant is none other than his best buddy from
childhood, MIKE ZLOZOWSKI (40s), an Irish-Polack from workingclass
Long Island. Henceforth known as ZLOZ.
ZLOZ
Moody! You handsome motherfucker.
I just had to have me a piece of
that ass. How the fuck are you,
buddy?!
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 3.
Zloz pulls Hank to his feet. Tugs him into a mammoth
embrace. Hank gives Zloz a serious once-over.
HANK
Jesus, where did that plane come
from? 1987? You look exactly the
same. And that smell...
cigarettes, booze and Drakkar
Noir... takes me right back.
ZLOZ
What about you? Ya look like halfa-fag
in that smoking jacket, but
you smell pretty much the same --
like a cock dipped in shit.
Hank looks at Zloz with a mixture of horror and bemused
affection.
HANK
It’s good to see you, Zloz. Been a
long time, my friend.
ZLOZ
Yeah, and whose fault is that? Who
never comes back to the Island?
Fancy book writer Hank-fuckingMoody,
that’s who.
HANK
What can I say? They won’t let me
back. I divulged too many small
town secrets, named too many names.
ZLOZ
Well, here I am, man. I finally
made it. LA, man. L-fucking-A.
HANK
So what’s going on? You sounded
pretty mysterious on the phone.
ZLOZ
Later. There’s plenty of time to
shoot the shit. First I wanna see
Britney’s vertical smile.
HANK
I’ll have to check the schedule. I
don’t think she’s showing this
week.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 4.
ZLOZ
Then I wanna act like a millionaire
and get properly ‘faced with my
best buddy in the whole wide world.
Whatta ya say?
HANK
I say we shoot for the moon. And
if we only make it halfway there,
so fucking be it. Still better
than working for the man...
ZLOZ
...and dying less than five miles
from where you were born. Mr.
Amato. 11th Grade English. Words
to live by. Come on -- let’s get
fucking ossified.
Off Hank, feeling the collision of past and present...
4 INT. RUNKLE HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 4
CHARLIE is atop MARCY, pumping away with youthful abandon.
He achieves fruition. At the same time she does, actually.
Charlie rolls off. A moment as they catch their breath.
CHARLIE
(winded)
Wow. Simultaneous cummage. That
never happens. Like ever. It must
be a sign!
MARCY
Not so fast, Runkle. We’ve thrown
each other a few bangs. So what?
Just a couple of lonely hearts
coming together to make the night a
little less cruel. In the whole
scheme of things, don’t mean shit.
CHARLIE
But it’s morning. We just had
morning sex.
MARCY
Don’t be dense, Charlie.
CHARLIE
I’ve got an idea.
MARCY
I’m scared.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 5.
CHARLIE
Go out with me.
MARCY
What?
CHARLIE
Go on a date with me. See if you
enjoy yourself. We’ll leave sexy
time out of it.
MARCY
I don’t know, Charlie. Sounds
kinda gay.
CHARLIE
Come on. Do you have any plans
tonight?
MARCY
Just me, the TiVo, and a big hunk
of dark chocolate.
CHARLIE
Omar’s coming over?
MARCY
I’m being literal, ya fuckin’
dunce.
CHARLIE
Shit, I think I was nibbling on
that last night. Finished it.
MARCY
Stop your grazing, asshole. You’re
eating me out of house and home.
CHARLIE
Come on. Sue Collini’s throwing a
party at her place. I have to go.
Be my date.
MARCY
Isn’t that going to be weird?
CHARLIE
Why, because I had relations with
her?
MARCY
That’s so gross, Charlie. I’m
throwing up in the back of my
throat right now.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 6.
CHARLIE
This from the girl who was recently
discovered playing Amistad in this
very room.
MARCY
Well, can’t say I’m not just a wee
bit curious to see where that broad
calls home.
CHARLIE
I know. Me too. So... Marcy Ellen
Runkle... will you go out with me?
MARCY
Shut up and eat my clam. I’ll
think about it.
Charlie disappears under the sheets. Marcy smiles.
5 INT. MARAT - DAY 5
Hank and Zloz at the bar. Zloz taking it all in. He’s a
long way from home and he’s feeling it.
ZLOZ
This place is fucking fancy, man.
HANK
Yeah, compared to... what was that
fucking dive called...?
ZLOZ
Mr. Beery’s? How the fuck do you
forget Mr. Beery’s? I was just
there last night.
HANK
You do not still hang out there.
ZLOZ
Sure do. Along with half our
graduating class. Every time I
walk in, it’s like a fucking high
school reunion. Whatever. Keeps
me from beating the kids and eating
a shotgun.
HANK
How many kids now?
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 7.
A beat. Zloz thinking this is something Hank should know.
He leaves it alone. Waves the BEAUTIFUL BARMAID over with
his index finger.
ZLOZ
Three. Which is three too fucking
many, lemme tell ya.
(to Beautiful Barmaid)
Hey, I made you come with one
finger. Imagine what I could do
with the rest.
Beautiful Barmaid rolls her eyes, annoyed. Hank winces,
embarrassed.
HANK
Jesus, Zloz. That old chestnut?
Stand down, buddy.
(to Beautiful Barmaid)
My apologies. He’s sick in the
head. On a weekend pass from the
asylum. Another round, m’lady?
She goes. Hank slaps Zloz upside the head.
HANK
What’s wrong with you?
ZLOZ
What? I’m sorry! Smokin’ hot
bitches everywhere you look.
What’s the move here?
HANK
The move?
ZLOZ
Yeah, they seem like a bunch of
stuck-up cunts.
HANK
Good opening line. See how that
works out for you.
ZLOZ
You still pulling a ton of ass?
HANK
I do okay.
ZLOZ
I got my dick wet first. Remember
that shit.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 8.
HANK
Fucking your first cousin doesn’t
count, turd-fondler.
ZLOZ
Sure it does. Pussy’s pussy.
Being inside it is all that
matters.
HANK
You should meet my agent. You two
would get along famously.
Another round of drinks arrive. Hank reaches for his wallet.
Zloz beats him to the punch.
ZLOZ
Fuck you. I got this.
Zloz throws a twenty down, turns away. Beautiful Barmaid
shakes her head -- not quite enough. Hank covers the rest.
Mouths “Keep it.”
ZLOZ
I feel a little under-dressed in
this joint.
HANK
That’s ‘cause you are. You look
like a fucking landscaper.
ZLOZ
I am a fucking landscaper. Own my
own company now, thank you very
much.
HANK
Hey, good for you.
ZLOZ
Yeah, whatever. Not quite the same
as getting paid to make shit up for
a living.
HANK
Which is a lot harder than it
looks. Trust me.
ZLOZ
Right. God, I’d love to have that
chick sit on my face before I die.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 9.
HANK
You’re talking a big game over
there, cowboy. Like you’d ever
cheat on Kim. How’s she doing?
ZLOZ
Yeah, that. That’s what I wanted
to tell ya. We’re through.
HANK
What?
ZLOZ
It’s over. We called it quits.
HANK
What happened?
ZLOZ
We got in a fight. Things were
said. Household appliances were
thrown. I got in the car. Hopped
on a plane to LA. Mind if I crash
on your couch for a while?
HANK
Fuck, yeah, I mind. I’m raising a
daughter, numb-nuts.
ZLOZ
How is Becca? What is she now?
Fifteen? Sixteen?
HANK
You’re not going to do any better,
asshole. Kim is beautiful. I used
to beat off to that girl almost
every day in high school. You were
my hero when you nailed her.
ZLOZ
Yeah, well... how does the saying
go? For every beautiful girl,
there’s a guy bored of fucking her.
Come on, let’s do something
already. Where’s the party?
HANK
What party?
ZLOZ
Somewhere out there, there’s a
party.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 10.
(MORE)
And there’s a blonde with big tits
just waiting for me to bang her.
Call your agent. Isn’t he paid to
make shit like that happen?
Hank chuckles, pulls out his phone, dials...
HANK
You don’t know my agent.
6 INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - DAY 6
Where a cheerful Charlie is just getting off the phone.
CHARLIE
Great, we’ll meet you guys there.
Looking forward to it. Any friend
of yours. I’ll see what I can do
about the blonde. With big tits,
right. See ya, buddy.
He hangs up, collects his stuff, ready to leave for the day
when lovely adult film ingenue DAISY appears in the doorway.
A very busty Daisy, in fact. Recently boob-jobbed. Smiling.
DAISY
Hey, you.
Charlie looks, lights up...
CHARLIE
Hey there, porn star...
Big hug. Charlie reacts to the enhanced breastage,
impressed.
CHARLIE
Wow. Your boobs. They’re really
big.
DAISY
I know, right?
CHARLIE
So that’s what my last ten grand
looks like, huh?
DAISY
You can touch ‘em if you want.
CHARLIE
Really?
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 11.
ZLOZ (CONT'D)
DAISY
Sure, you paid for ‘em. Feel me
up, citizen.
Charlie makes a meal out of fondling the fakies. Approaches
them from every conceivable angle.
CHARLIE
I knew you’d come back. Sooner or
later.
DAISY
You did?
CHARLIE
Yeah, I said it, remember?
DAISY
Oh right. When I broke up with
you. You were all like, “You’ll be
back! They all come back! Sooner
or later!”
CHARLIE
Exactly. And here you am be.
DAISY
Here I am be.
CHARLIE
The thing is, Daisy... much as I
look back fondly on our little
afternoon in the sun... I don’t
think I can go back there. Trying
to mend fences with the Mrs.
DAISY
Aww. You two are great together.
Good luck with that.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
DAISY
Okay, so two things.
CHARLIE
I’m all ears.
DAISY
Eyes, Charlie. Look in my eyes.
CHARLIE
Sorry. They’re just so very big.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 12.
DAISY
I’m getting married.
CHARLIE
Holy shit! Who’s the lucky guy?
DAISY
Ronnie Praeger. The director.
Remember him?
CHARLIE
Sure. Who could forget the
visionary helmer behind Vaginatown?
DAISY
We’re doing a new one. A musical.
Little Anal Annie. It’s an homage
to...
CHARLIE
Annie. Right, very clever. Wow.
So you’re doing porn again?
DAISY
Yeah, I’m just really good at it.
And I get to sing, too.
CHARLIE
Well, congrats. I guess.
DAISY
Thanks! I think it’s gonna be fun.
CHARLIE
What was the other thing?
DAISY
The other thing?
CHARLIE
Yeah, you said there were two
things.
DAISY
Oh, right. Yeah, so I’ve been
making the rounds, informing my
partners about the various STDs
I’ve contracted. Nothing too
crazy, mind you -- nothing lifethreatening
or anything -- but you
might want to get to the doctor and
have him whip up some kind of
cocktail to help fight it off.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 13.
(MORE)
Because lemme tell ya -- this is
some really pernicious shit. My
vagina looks like downtown Baghdad
right now.
Charlie feels a sudden wave of nausea.
DAISY
Charlie, are you okay?
CHARLIE
I think so. I’m just a little
dizzy. And clammy. Do I feel
clammy to you? Is that how it
starts?
DAISY
Shit, I gotta get going. Ronnie
and I are registering at the Crate
& Barrel down the street. We’re
sending you guys an invite, you
know. You better come.
CHARLIE
Sure, if I’m not in a syphilitic
coma by then.
She gives him a sweet little kiss and goes, leaving Charlie
unsure whether he should weep or vomit.
7 INT. COLLINI HOUSE - EVENING 7
Hank and Zloz wander into the Hollywood party of your
cinematic daydreams. It should feel like we’ve stepped into
another era. A sweet spot somewhere between 1979 and 1985.
ZLOZ
Fucking-A. This is some serious
Scarface shit right here.
Hank quickly finds Charlie and Marcy in the crowd.
HANK
Runkles... I want you to meet the
almighty Zloz. My best friend from
the Island of Long.
ZLOZ
Mike Zlozowski. Nice to meet you
guys. Thanks for taking good care
of my boy.
Ad-libbed greetings are exchanged. Zloz says to Hank:
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 14.
DAISY (CONT'D)
ZLOZ
So this is your Ovitz?
HANK
If by Ovitz you mean the man who
does absolutely nothing to improve
my professional life and only
serves to amuse me, then yes, this
is my Ovitz.
CHARLIE
(to Zloz)
Let me ask you: was he always such
a prick?
ZLOZ
Always. It’s a disease, really. I
had to hand him his ass on an
almost daily basis.
SUE COLLINI greets them, martini in hand...
COLLINI
Welcome...
Hugs and hellos and whatnot.
A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR cruises up alongside Collini. A
handsome, well-dressed older man. Somewhat erudite.
WHEELCHAIR GUY
This must be Runkle. I see what
you mean. Great head for helming.
COLLINI
I’d like to introduce my husband...
Walter Collini.
Looks are thrown between Hank and the Runkles. Hank chuckles
and gives Charlie a pat on the back.
HANK
Enjoy yourself, Cap’n.
Hank wanders off with Zloz. Charlie pulls Collini aside.
CHARLIE
Whoa, hold on a second here.
You’re married...?
COLLINI
Twenty-five years and counting.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 15.
CHARLIE
I had no idea.
COLLINI
You never asked.
CHARLIE
I feel very strange about this.
COLLINI
Don’t you worry, Runkle. Walter
and I have an open relationship.
As you can see, he has certain
limitations. But he’s a master of
the oral arts.
(to Marcy)
You should give him a try sometime.
Whereupon he wags his tongue and does a fancy little
wheelchair wheelie for emphasis. Marcy starts to mutter:
MARCY
There’s no place like home, there’s
no place like home, there’s no
place like home...
8 EXT. COLLINI HOUSE - NIGHT 8
Hank finds Zloz out by the pool, talking to some VAPID CHICK.
ZLOZ
Is your father a lumberjack?
Because whenever I look at you, I
get serious wood in my pants.
Vapid Chick walks off. Hank hands him a beer. They clink.
HANK
Nice job, Shecky Greene.
ZLOZ
To the City of Angels and its stuckup
snatch...
HANK
Come on. Can’t we do better than
that? Let’s drink to fucking
Levittown. From whence we came.
ZLOZ
I don’t know, Moody. I could get
used to this. Fuck, I’ve got some
screenplay ideas.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 16.
(MORE)
I mean, what’s stopping me from
taking this city by storm?
HANK
Me. Just me. I won’t let you.
ZLOZ
You trying to hold me back? Keep
it all for yourself?
HANK
That out there -- that’s a fucking
mirage. You’ve got everything you
could ever want or need back at
home. Trust me.
ZLOZ
What the fuck do you know about
back home? You got out years ago.
It’s easy for you to spout some
working-class-hero-Springsteen
bullshit about the sanctity of
small towns when you’re driving a
Porsche through the Promised Land.
HANK
You got it all wrong, man.
ZLOZ
See that broad over there?
Zloz nods out a CALIFORNIA GIRL over yonder.
ZLOZ
I’m gonna go talk to her. Maybe
she’s warm for my form, maybe she’s
not. I’m no Marky Mark or nothing,
but I’m going down swinging
tonight.
HANK
Zloz, I speak from experience when
I say that some things are best
left a fantasy. Once you cross
that line, it’s hard to find your
way back home.
ZLOZ
Hank Moody. My best friend.
Trying to save my soul. Let me ask
you something. You know any of my
kids’ names? Their birthdays.
(off his look)
S’what I thought. Wish me luck.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 17.
ZLOZ (CONT'D)
9 INT. COLLINI HOUSE - SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT 9
Charlie and Marcy find themselves in a verbal headlock with
Sue and Walter Collini.
COLLINI
Who wants to go down to the
playroom and make a little movie?
We’ve got a camera, a tripod, and a
dirty futon.
MARCY
That sounds like a snuff film.
WALTER COLLINI
Nonsense. Runkle, have you ever
seen a stag film?
CHARLIE
I’ve seen my fair share of porn.
WALTER COLLINI
Not porn, you simpleton. A stag
film is different. Evokes a bygone
era. A better time for sex.
CHARLIE
I don’t believe I have, Mr.
Collini.
WALTER COLLINI
Listen to me. We have something in
common, you and I. Something few
men share. We’ve both been inside
this gorgeous glass of gin over
here. You call me Walter. You
understand?
CHARLIE
Okay, fair enough. Walter it is.
COLLINI
Walter has one of the preeminent
stag film collections in the
country.
WALTER COLLINI
It’s one of my great passions.
MARCY
What is it you do for a living,
Walter?
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 18.
WALTER COLLINI
Look around, my dear. I buy and
sell erotic art. That’s what gets
this soldier hard.
(off their looks)
Not down there. No sirree. That
thing’s about as useful as a piece
of string cheese. But my tongue.
That’s where it’s at. When I get
aroused, all the blood rushes to my
mouth. It’s almost better than a
penis. It’s a heat-seeker.
He wags his tongue at Marcy, who cowers, grossed-out.
COLLINI
He speaks the truth, my man does.
Although I’m still a penetration
junkie at heart. Which is why he’s
kind enough to let me shop
elsewhere.
CHARLIE
If you don’t mind me asking,
Walter, how’d you end up in the
chair?
WALTER COLLINI
This one over here rode me so hard
one night she broke my member. It
ballooned up. Got all swollen and
purple. Like an eggplant. I
freaked out, thought I was never
going to be able to make love
again. So I threw myself off the
deck. Broke just about every bone
in my body. But Sue Collini -- she
stayed with me. Through thick and
thin. To Hell and back. I love
her madly.
Walter and Sue make out furiously. Marcy elbows Charlie.
They try to sneak away. No such luck. Busted.
COLLINI
Hey, where do you two think you’re
going?
MARCY
We gotta call and check on the
kids.
COLLINI
I didn’t know you had kids, Runkle.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 19.
CHARLIE
You never asked.
They skedaddle.
10 INT. COLLINI HOUSE - NIGHT 10
Hank is shooting some pool when a flabbergasted Zloz races
in, soaking wet, pulling on his clothes.
ZLOZ
Dude, she has a cock!
HANK
Really? Are you sure? Maybe it’s
just an oversized clit.
ZLOZ
Things were going really well. Too
well. We were making out in the
hot tub. She said she wanted to
tell me something. I thought she
had a boyfriend or something. Next
thing I know, she guides my hand
down to her thin, bent dong.
HANK
So then what? You gave her a
handie?
ZLOZ
Fuck you. I fucking clocked her.
Him. Whatever.
HANK
Zloz, you can’t do shit like that.
That’s a human being.
ZLOZ
What the fuck is wrong with you,
Moody? Have you been in LA so long
that a chick with a dick means
nothing to you?
The Tranny enters, loaded for bear. Hell-bent on kicking
Zloz’s ass. Hank intervenes.
TRANNY
Your friend’s a closeted fucking
homo.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 20.
HANK
I’ve been telling him that for
years now.
ZLOZ
Hey, them’s fighting words.
TRANNY
Asshole. I thought you knew. And
then when I realized you didn’t, I
tried to break it to you gently.
HANK
For what it’s worth, I think you’re
beautiful. You could totally pass
for a lady.
TRANNY
Thank you, sweetie.
ZLOZ
Great, you two should get a room.
TRANNY
I think he knew. Deep down. He
was looking for a little meat.
His sexuality challenged, Zloz does what comes natural -- he
takes a swing. Pissed, Hank shoves Zloz. They end up in a
retard-clumsy fistfight. At which point Collini enters.
COLLINI
Boys! Enough! There will be no
fighting in this house. Love is to
be made here. The Collinis are
open to all shapes and sizes and
sexual preferences. Ignorance will
not be tolerated.
HANK
I understand. You’re completely
right, Sue. We’re deeply ashamed.
Right? Right, Zloz?
ZLOZ
Maybe you are.
(off his look)
I’m deeply ashamed. That I touched
a tranny’s cock.
COLLINI
Now that we’ve cleared that up, you
boys wanna go skiing with me?
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 21.
She mimes “skiing.” Both hands working a pole. Hank and
Zloz look at each other. Exeunt.
11 INT. COLLINI HOUSE - PLAYROOM - NIGHT 11
Marcy drags Charlie into the “playroom.” Collini wasn’t
lying. There’s a videocamera on a tripod, and it’s trained
on a dirty futon on the floor.
CHARLIE
What are you doing?
MARCY
All this erotica’s got me all sexedup
and shit. You know how I am.
The more I get, the more I want.
CHARLIE
Maybe not tonight, though. Maybe
we take a break.
MARCY
Why? Why don’t you want to fuck
me?
CHARLIE
Because this is my boss’s house.
MARCY
So what? Your boss is a stone
freak. I think she would very much
approve of a quickie happening
right under her very roof.
CHARLIE
I’m also a little sore. Chafed,
really.
MARCY
Okay, what the fuck is going on?
CHARLIE
Nothing. I guess I’m just a little
overwhelmed by the whiplash nature
of our relationship.
MARCY
Bullshit. You fucked someone else,
didn’t you?
CHARLIE
No way. Never. I’m done with that
behavior.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 22.
MARCY
Something’s up with you, Runkle.
CHARLIE
Daisy came to see me today.
MARCY
I knew it! A woman always knows.
So what, you wanna go back to her
now? Have some skanky little porno
babies? Make up your fucking mind
already, Runkle!
CHARLIE
No, I told her I want to be with
you. Only with you. My one true
love.
MARCY
And what’d she say, that little
tramp?
CHARLIE
Well... actually... and this is
interesting... she said that she
had contracted a few STDs. Nothing
too crazy, mind you. Nothing a
bolus of antibiotics won’t cure.
MARCY
Wow. I seriously think I’m gonna
throw up right now.
CHARLIE
That’s what I said. I think.
Maybe I said I was dizzy. Same
difference, really.
Marcy really does look like she’s going to puke. She’s
doubled over, trying to catch her breath. Charlie tries to
comfort her.
She comes up for air. Hauls off and PUNCHES HIM in the face.
MARCY
I’m taking your little fucking girl
car, Charlie. Don’t you dare come
home tonight.
12 EXT. COLLINI HOUSE - NIGHT 12
Hank and Zloz exit to find a distraught Charlie watching
Marcy take off in his aqua blue Z3.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 23.
HANK
What’s wrong, Donkey Kong? Where’s
the Marce going?
(sees his face)
Jesus. What happened to your face?
CHARLIE
She punched me. My fault, of
course. I think I gave her some
VD.
HANK
Of course you did.
ZLOZ
Shotgun!
They pile into the Porsche. Charlie is forced to wedge
himself into the tiny back seat. Away they go...
13 INT. FASTER PUSSYCAT - NIGHT 13
Absolute chaos. Lights, music, girls galore... all captured
by shaky, hand-held cameras. Hank is talking to JACKIE at
the bar.
HANK
Hey, do you know any ladies who are
more or less a sure thing?
JACKIE
You’re looking at one.
HANK
That’s sweet. For my friend over
there.
Hank nods at a trashed Zloz, who is enjoying the shit out of
a lap dance from a BUSTY BLONDE STRIPPER.
ZLOZ
(shouts to Hank)
Now this is more like it! You see
the tits on this broad?!
Jackie frowns at Hank.
HANK
He’s a really nice guy. Deep down.
Very deep down.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 24.
JACKIE
This is a strip club, Hank. Not a
whorehouse.
Charlie, meanwhile, has a STRIPPER working one leg and a
LITTLE PERSON STRIPPER bouncing on the other. He SHOUTS over
the music:
CHARLIE
Be careful, ladies! I think I
might have an STD!
STRIPPER
What’s that, honey?!
CHARLIE
I think I have an STD!
STRIPPER
An MP3?!
CHARLIE
Never mind...
And now we’re with Zloz, who’s in hog heaven. Although he
can’t help but ask:
ZLOZ
Hey, you don’t happen to have a
dick, do ya?
(off her look)
No offense or anything.
Busty Blonde Stripper looks at him for a moment, annoyed.
BUSTY BLONDE STRIPPER
None taken.
She takes his hand and places it firmly on her crotch.
ZLOZ
Nope. No dick down there. No hair
either. Sorry I doubted you,
sweetheart.
Back to business. She takes her top off. Big boobs spill
out. Zloz is beside himself. Finds himself mesmerized.
A moment.
Too drunk to stop himself, he dives right in. Like a hungry
baby, he latches onto a nipple and won’t let go.
Busty Blonde Stripper freaks out and SCREAMS for help.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 25.
A WWE-SIZED BOUNCER is there in no time. Grabs Zloz in a
bear hug and heads for the door.
Hanks sees what’s going on and throws himself in between.
HANK
What happened? What’d he do?
WWE-SIZED BOUNCER
He was sucking her titties. That’s
not cool.
HANK
Shit, you got that right.
(to Zloz)
What were you thinking?
ZLOZ
Hank, they were fucking epic. I
couldn’t help myself. She was like
Mamie Van Doren meets Samantha Fox.
You know what a tit man I am!
Hank produces some cash, tries to smooth things over.
HANK
(to bouncer)
Look, can we forget about this?
You can take the boy out of Long
Island... you know what I’m saying?
ZLOZ
Hey, that’s fucking condescending,
you prick.
HANK
I’m not the one who’s still breastfeeding,
asshole.
WWE-SIZED BOUNCER
Forget it. I’m tossing workingclass
here out on his ass...
Zloz sees red, takes a swing. The bouncer swings back.
Something akin to a western bar fight breaks out. The whole
place goes shithouse. Zloz looks at Hank with a crazy grin.
ZLOZ
You with me, compadre?
Hank sighs and joins the fray...
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 26.
14 INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - MORNING 14
Which should resemble David Lee Roth’s hotel room circa 1984.
It looks like a fucking bomb went off. And much fun was had.
Next to Hank, tangled up in the sheets, SLEEPING BEAUTY. All
blonde hair and dangerous curves. We can’t see her face.
Hank gets out of bed. Too fast. Puts his hands out to stop
the spinning. Courtesy of the night before, natch.
He stumbles around the room, looking for something he can’t
quite find. Then -- a light bulb moment. He lurches into:
15 THE BATHROOM 15
Where the sudsy remains of a bubble bath are still in the
tub. He shoves a hand into the froth, comes up with various
and sundry articles of clothing.
Tops, bottoms, lacy what-have-you’s. Finally producing his
sunglasses.
He shakes off the suds. Slides them on. Looks in the
mirror. Improvs some kung fu moves. And then it’s...
16 INTO THE DINING ROOM 16
It’s a fucking mess in here, too. Bottles of booze
everywhere. A mushroom cloud of cigarette smoke hanging in
the air.
Hank crosses paths with last night’s Little Person Stripper,
who is exiting Becca’s bedroom. She gives him a nod and a
wink and heads for the kitchen.
Hank watches as she opens the fridge and guzzles some OJ out
of the carton. He turns, walks into...
17 BECCA’S BEDROOM 17
Where another stripper is passed out in Becca’s bed.
A GNARLY PAIR OF MALE FEET poke out from under the covers
next to her head.
Hank peeks under the covers down by the girl’s feet. Finds
an unconscious Charlie under there. Sporting a nasty shiner.
Hank puts the covers back over Charlie’s face. Leaves the
room...
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 27.
18 IN THE LIVING ROOM 18
Zloz is passed out on the floor.
Hank sighs, looks at his old friend with equal measures
compassion and disgust. He gets an idea. Goes...
19 INTO HIS BEDROOM 19
Where he shakes Sleeping Beauty. Turns out it’s Jackie. She
wakes up yawning. All sleepy and cute. Smiles at Hank.
JACKIE
Morning, teach. Our first
sleepover.
HANK
Yeah, wish I remembered a little
more of it.
JACKIE
Did we take a bubble bath?
HANK
There is evidence to support that
theory, yes.
(then)
Can you do me big favor?
20 INT. HANK’S PLACE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 20
We’re CLOSE ON ZLOZ as he wakes up.
Trying to remember where he is and how the fuck he got there.
He senses a body curled up next to him on the floor. He
looks:
It’s Jackie. Sound asleep. He can’t believe his good
fortune. He peeks under the blanket. Yep, she’s naked.
Even better. She wakes up. All sleepy and cute. Smiles.
ZLOZ
Did we...?
JACKIE
Oh fuck yeah.
ZLOZ
Wow. Was I any good?
JACKIE
The best. You’ve got a great cock.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 28.
ZLOZ
Good times...
Hank comes out of the bedroom. Yawning. As if he just woke
up. Zloz leaps to feet. Runs into Hank’s arms. Big hug.
Hank pats his naked friend on the back. Looks at Jackie.
HANK
(mouths)
Thank you...
JACKIE
(smiles, mouths back)
You’re welcome...
21 EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY 21
Hank and Zloz play catch on the sand.
ZLOZ
Fucking beautiful here, man. Takes
your breath away sometimes.
HANK
Yeah, it’s one of the perks. That
and In-N-Out Burger.
ZLOZ
I got a question for ya.
HANK
Shoot.
ZLOZ
How come you never made it to my
wedding?
HANK
Shit, I dunno. I was pissed at
you, I guess. I didn’t want to see
you throw your life away. We had a
plan.
ZLOZ
Yeah. And I fucked it up.
HANK
We were gonna make it out of there.
The two of us. Together. I was
gonna be a famous writer. You were
gonna be a rock star. That’s the
way I saw it back then. Black and
white. I was an idiot.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 29.
(MORE)
Couldn’t have been more wrong. You
did a beautiful thing, Zloz. You
stepped up. Married that girl.
Had a family. Don’t be a shithead.
Don’t throw that away for blondes
with big tits and screenplay ideas.
A moment.
ZLOZ
I was really sorry to hear about
your dad.
HANK
Yeah, me too. Thanks for the
flowers you guys sent.
ZLOZ
Did you hear Mr. Amato passed away
last year?
HANK
You’re kidding me. Guess it kinda
proves his theory. Maybe you
really do die less than five miles
from where you were born.
ZLOZ
Yeah, they’re dropping like flies
back there.
HANK
Who else?
ZLOZ
(shrugs)
I get these nosebleeds.
HANK
Nosebleeds? What do you mean?
ZLOZ
Never thought much of ‘em. Thought
maybe it was that big blow phase we
went through in our twenties.
Finally, Kim makes me go to the
doctor. Turns out I’m sick, dude.
HANK
Sick? What do you mean, sick?
ZLOZ
Sick like I got something I have to
deal with sick.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 30.
HANK (CONT'D)
(MORE)
I gotta have a shitload of tests.
I keep putting ‘em off. That’s why
me and Kim had such a fucking blowout.
It’s not a good time right
now.
(looks around)
I’m really glad I got to see this.
HANK
You’re not gonna die, Zloz.
ZLOZ
Maybe. Maybe not. Eventually I
will. You too. Not even Hank
Moody can escape that dude’s
fucking clutches.
HANK
We’ll see about that.
ZLOZ
Whatever happens, it got me
thinking about things. How fucking
short it all is. How once upon a
time we were thick as thieves. Now
we’re not. I don’t know what
happened. Or why. I just wish I
knew the moment it all changed.
Because I’d do something different.
HANK
Me too.
ZLOZ
You were my best friend, Hank.
That’s gotta count for something,
right?
HANK
Of course it does. That’s the
problem with this place, man. It’s
not a state. It’s a state of mind.
Nothing feels real. Years go by in
the blink of an eye. Your past
starts to feel like some old movie
you saw on TV once upon a time. I
never meant to let things slide,
Zloz. But I guess I did. Doesn’t
change the fact that I miss the
shit outta you.
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 31.
ZLOZ (CONT'D)
ZLOZ
Well, it looks like I came a long
fucking way to say I miss the shit
out of you, too, buddy.
Hank looks away, blinks back some facial moisture.
ZLOZ
Jesus, Moody, I haven’t seen you
cry since Thurman Munson died.
C’mere, you silly son of a bitch.
They hug it out. End up rolling around on the sand.
Laughing like a couple of kids in the middle of an endless
summer.
22 INT. DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE - DAY INTO NIGHT INTO DAY 22
A nice and grainy Bolex montage. A great song. Hank and
Zloz in the Porsche. Cruising Sunset. Soaking up LA. Hank
giving his friend a crash course in the sights and sounds of
the city. Taking us all the way to:
23 EXT. LAX - DAY 23
The dirty black Porsche pulls up to the curb. Hank and Zloz
get out.
HANK
Sorry I have to drop you off so
early, but I gotta pick up the
little monster.
ZLOZ
No worries. Gives me plenty of
time to get loaded and piss myself
on the plane.
Big hug. Hank won’t let go.
ZLOZ
Are you crying again, you fucking
faggot?
HANK
Take care of yourself, okay?
ZLOZ
I will. I promise. And thanks for
showing me a good time. What
happens in LA... right, brother?
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 32.
HANK
Hey, it’s in the vault.
(then)
You think you’ll be able to patch
things up with the old lady?
ZLOZ
Tell ya the truth -- she doesn’t
even know I’m gone. She was so
pissed at me she went off to
Atlantic City with a couple of her
girlfriends. For all I know, she
made out with a tranny, too.
HANK
You’re a colossal pussy, you know
that?
ZLOZ
Pretty much, yeah. You better come
visit sometime. I got a buncha
kids who’ve heard a shitload of
Hank Moody stories and can’t put a
face to the name.
HANK
That’s no good.
ZLOZ
No, it’s not.
HANK
Yeah, well... I love ya, Zloz.
ZLOZ
Love you, too, Moody. Ya fuckin’
homo.
Zloz smiles, picks up his bag and goes, disappearing into the
terminal. Hank watches him go. But there’s little time for
reflection.
All of a sudden, BECCA blows past him. Climbs into the
backseat with her bag. Hank sighs.
HANK
Wow. Not even a hello? Good
times. Hey, what am I, your limo
driver? Get in the front --
Hank is on his way to the driver’s side when a familiar voice
stops him:
 CALIFORNICATION EP.305 PRODUCTION DRAFT 5/11/09 33.
KAREN
What, you’re just gonna leave
without me...?
Hank looks. And there she is. KAREN. Bag in hand.
Smiling. And yes, his heart skips a beat. Or two. Is she a
mirage?
BECCA
Merry fucking Christmas. Can we go
home already?
Without missing a beat:
HANK & KAREN
Shut up.
Hank moves to Karen. Pulls her into his arms. She smells
like home. Life is good in the Golden State.
OVER AND OUT.

FADE IN:
1 INT. HANK’S PLACE - NIGHT 1
HANK’s in the living room. Talking dirty to his laptop.
HANK
Come on... show me something.
Start small. The hint of an
aureola. The suggestion of a
nipple maybe. See how it feels and
we’ll go from there. No pressure.
Unless you wanna see my schween.
‘Cause I’ll totally unfurl for ya.
I’m not shy.
Reveal KAREN on the laptop screen. Vaguely amused.
KAREN
Hank. Stop it. Your daughter
could walk out at any second.
HANK
That’s impossible.
KAREN
Unlikely maybe, not impossible.
And I highly doubt she wants to see
your schween.
HANK
Gross. Why ya gotta talk like
that? But there’s like 0.0 percent
chance of that happening. She’s
not even on the premises.
Karen is immediately annoyed. Yep, you can tell.
KAREN
And where might she be this
evening, Hank?
HANK
(sensing trouble)
Oh, she just ran out. To the
liquor store. Be back any second.
Same time tomorrow? Okay, bye
now...
KAREN
She’s with “them,” isn’t she?
HANK
Them? They’re not an alien race
bent on galactic domination, Karen.
KAREN
How do you know? Do you have
proof?
HANK
Shit, you’re right. I guess I
should explore the grounds. There
could be a portal of some kind in
the topiary garden.
KAREN
Okay, signing off.
HANK
Wait -- no virtual sexy time?
KAREN
Your fault. You broke the spell.
HANK
Me, it’s my fault? You were agin
it when you thought Becca was in
her room, and now you’re agin it
because Becca’s spending the night
with the Tudors. I can’t win with
you, woman.
Karen smiles. Starts to take her top off. Hank gets
excited. Rubs his hands together. And then she abruptly
signs off. Hank is perturbed by the virtual cock-tease.
HANK
That was not nice. Seriously, that
was mean.
Hank slams the laptop shut. Bored, he picks up his nearby
Les Paul. Plucks a few notes. Plays rock star for a moment.
A KNOCK at the front door. Guitar slung low behind him, he
makes his way to the door.
Opens it to JACKIE and A SMOKIN’ HOT PAIR OF STRIPPER GALPALS.
Jackie brandishing a big bottle of Jack Daniels.
JACKIE
Wanna party?
Off Hank, a kid face-to-face with the hot fudge sundae of his
dreams, cut to MAIN TITLES.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 2.
2 INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
Hank gradually wakes up in a bed full of naked strippers.
Only one of whom is awake and looking at him fondly: Jackie.
The other two are still passed out.
HANK
I know we killed that bottle of
Jack, but I don’t remember making
the sex with Betty and Veronica.
JACKIE
Nah, they mostly amused themselves.
I’m not so good with the sharing.
Much with the kissing and the fondling.
HANK
Hey, you never told me what you
guys were out celebrating.
JACKIE
Oh, yeah. That. My last dance.
(off his look)
I’m done.
HANK
With?
JACKIE
The stripping.
HANK
Really? Ya don’t say...
JACKIE
Yep. I’m out. No more grinding on
middle-aged hard-ons for me.
Except for yours, of course.
HANK
Hey, who ya calling middle-aged?
JACKIE
You. My old dude boyfriend.
HANK
Oh, is that what I am?
JACKIE
Sure. A girl doesn’t give up the
pole for just anyone, you know.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 3.
HANK
Stop. You’re gonna make me blush.
So what’s next for you?
JACKIE
Writing. I’m gonna give it a go.
Fuck, it’s what makes me happiest.
So what if I die poor, drunk and
alone?
HANK
Who’s to say you wouldn’t go out
that way anyway?
JACKIE
Well, thanks for helping me see the
light, teach.
HANK
My pleasure. I’m honored. And
beyond giddy that my half-baked
wisdom is working for you. But...
JACKIE
You’re not seriously gonna try
breaking up with me again, are you?
HANK
Well, to be fair and balanced about
it all, the phrase “breaking up”
suggests that, once upon a time, we
were together.
JACKIE
Okay, just so I’m clear -- the
sheer amount of no holds barred sex
we’ve been having does not indicate
a certain level of intimacy?
HANK
Well, sure. Sure it does.
(confused)
What’s your point?
JACKIE
For a man who loves women, you
don’t seem to understand them very
well. Every time we sleep
together... every time you’re
inside me... every time I come... I
get just a little bit more attached
to you.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 4.
HANK
Okay, I hear that. And I know it
feels fairly momentous and all, but
I think this is one of those rites
of passage they talk about. Yep.
Every comely young college gal has
a fling with her favorite
professor. Even my old lady had
one. Used to really gross me out.
Now I understand. It’s like she
was fucking me before she met me.
Helps me sleep easier.
The phone RINGS. Hank’s never been more pleased by the
shrillness of it all. Until he sees who it is: Karen. He
gets out of bed. Heads out of the room.
HANK
Yikes. I should probably take this
elsewhere. In Santa Monica,
perhaps.
JACKIE
Tell her I said hi.
HANK
Will do.
3 INT. HANK’S PLACE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3
Hank waits until he’s in the living room to answer.
HANK
City morgue. You kill ‘em, we
chill ‘em.
Intercut with:
4 INT. KAREN’S OFFICE IN NYC - DAY 4
KAREN
Did she get off to school okay?
HANK
Jeez, one would hope.
KAREN
That’s not very comforting.
HANK
Look, the dean peoples are many
things, but not punctual is not one
of them. So don’t worry so much.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 5.
KAREN
I called her cell to check in.
Texted her. Checked her Twitter
page. Nothing. No response.
HANK
That means very little. She never
hollas back or Twats when she’s all
aggro.
KAREN
What the fuck is she so aggro
about?
HANK
Duh. We’re ruining her life,
remember? Or maybe it’s game day
for the Crimson Tide. We all know
how edgy you get when Aunt Flo’s in
town.
KAREN
Are you trying to piss me off right
now?
HANK
See? Is it arts and crafts week at
panty camp for you too?
An alarmed Jackie comes out of the bedroom. Calls out:
JACKIE
Hank!
Hank clamps his hand over the receiver. Stomps the floor in
frustration. Growls. Gestures for Jackie to get her ass
back in the bedroom.
KAREN
What was that?
HANK
What was what?
KAREN
Someone shouted “Hank.”
HANK
Oh, the cleaning lady. That was
the cleaning lady.
(yells off)
Be right there, Consuela!
He adds a nice blast of Spanglish for good measure.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 6.
KAREN
When did you get a cleaning lady?
HANK
Soon. Recently. This place is a
fucking mess. You saw that shit.
I gotta go. She doesn’t appear to
be dusting. Peace and love.
Hank hangs up and heads into
5 INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 5
where Jackie and one of her stripper friends is trying to
rouse the other. Chick’s not moving.
HANK
What the fuck is this?
JACKIE
She won’t wake up.
HANK
Holy shitness. Is she dead?
Hank gets up close. Winces.
HANK
Wow. That’s some intense morning
breath. What is that?
(goes in for another
sniff)
Ah, yes... cheese doodles and beer.
Midnight snack of champions. At
least she’s still breathing.
What’d she take?
JACKIE
Who knows? She’s a walking
pharmacy, this one.
STRIPPER
She took some Ex. We both did.
HANK
Yeah, you guys were like a couple
of cats on the edge of the bed. It
was like watching the Yule Log.
With lesbian strippers.
A KNOCK at the door. Hank sighs. Wants to kill somebody.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 7.
6 INT. HANK’S PLACE - FRONT DOOR - MORNING 6
Hank opens the door to a cheerful CHARLIE and a twitchy RICK
SPRINGFIELD.
CHARLIE
Top of the morning, chum.
HANK
What the fuck do you want?
RICK SPRINGFIELD
(to Charlie)
Does he know who I am?
CHARLIE
Of course he knows who you are.
You guys met at my place. Shared a
meal, in fact. Broke some bread.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Then where’s the respect? Why’s he
being a douche?
HANK
Hey, watch it, Rick Springfield.
I’m in no mood.
CHARLIE
Okay, studs. Settle down. No need
for a cock fight.
(to Hank)
We’re here to check out the
Porsche. You’re selling. Rick’s
looking to buy. We firmed it up
last night, remember?
HANK
Yeah, sure, now I do. But can we
reschedule? I’ve got a comatose
stripper in my bed.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Been there. Need some help?
7 INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - MORNING 7
The boys walk in just as Jackie and the other stripper have
the comatose one sitting up on the edge of the bed.
But as soon as they let go, she slumps off the bed, onto the
floor, landing with a most unpleasant THUD.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 8.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Oh, man! D’ja hear that?! Nothing
like the sound of a stripper’s head
on a hardwood floor!
HANK
What the fuck is wrong with you?
RICK SPRINGFIELD
What? You never rough ‘em up?
‘Scuse me, George Bailey.
(to Charlie)
Get a load of this guy. Fuckin’
last boy scout over here.
Rick Springfield eyes Jackie, starts singing “Jessie’s Girl”
right to her. Hank looks at Charlie.
HANK
You gotta get this fuckin’ ass
clown outta here. Before I start
swingin’..
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Oh yeah? You wanna throw down, bad
boy? You think you can take this?
Guess what? I shit a pint of blood
this morning.
HANK
Why?
(to Charlie)
Just do me a favor and get these
girls out of here, okay?
CHARLIE
I don’t know, Hank. This seems
like dirty business. Kinda shady.
HANK
Charlie, when was the last time I
actually asked you to do something
for me?
CHARLIE
I got you those Stones tickets.
HANK
Yes. You did. In the spring of
2003.
CHARLIE
That wasn’t easy, you know. I had
to make a lot of calls.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 9.
Hank stares Charlie down until he leaps into problem-solver
mode.
CHARLIE
Okay, here’s what we do. Rick and
I will take her to the ER. See
what’s what.
(to Rick Springfield)
And while we’re there, we should
take a look at why you’re shitting
so much blood.
Charlie and Rick Springfield pick up the semi-conscious
stripper and start carrying her toward the front door. The
other stripper looks at Rick. Makes a connection.
STRIPPER
Hey, you’re Rick Springfield,
aren’t you?
RICK SPRINGFIELD
That’s right, tiny dancer. You
look familiar. You ever shake your
ass for me?
STRIPPER
No, but my mom did. I think you
guys boned.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Right on. She say good things
about my big ten inch?
STRIPPER
She said you refused to put a
rubber on it.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
That’s right, baby. Skin on skin.
Let the love begin.
Rick Springfield loses focus and accidentally bangs the
stripper’s head against the dining room table.
HANK
Hey, watch what the fuck you’re
doing, Rick Springfield!
Rick Springfield suddenly drops his end of the stripper.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 10.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
(to Charlie)
Okay, I’ve just about had it with
this guy and his snotty fucking
comments.
(to Hank)
I will fuck you until your ass
bleeds, cowboy.
HANK
Thank God. Because I don’t think
that would take very long.
Just as they’re about to throw down, there’s another KNOCK at
the door. Everyone stops short.
Hank shushes everyone, goes to the door. Looks through the
peephole. It’s JILL. Aargh. He waits a beat, hoping she’ll
go away.
JILL (O.S.)
I know you’re in there, Hank! I
heard footsteps! Open up!
Hank sighs, disgusted, waves everyone back into the bedroom.
Once they’re all safely ensconced, Hank opens the door to a
very playful and coquettish Jill.
JILL
Good morning...
HANK
Look at you. Paying a house call.
JILL
Thought I’d catch you before you
left for work.
HANK
And catch me you did.
JILL
Yeah, seeing as you’re always late,
I figured it was a safe bet.
(then)
Are you going to invite me in?
HANK
What are you? A vampire?
JILL
I want to tell you something. I’ve
got news. Big news.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 11.
HANK
Can it wait? I was just about to
get in the shower.
JILL
Can I join you? We can discuss it
in there.
HANK
Hey, I thought we agreed to put a
stop to such shenanigans.
JILL
That’s exactly what I wanted to
talk to you about.
She blows in past him. Heads straight for the bedroom. Hank
is forced to head her off at the pass.
HANK
How ‘bout a cup of coffee?
JILL
Nah, not so much. Just brushed. A
coupla Altoids too.
HANK
Well, I’m gonna get me a cup.
JILL
Good for you. Join me in the
boudoir.
HANK
Please don’t.
JILL
What?
HANK
Please don’t go in there.
JILL
Oh my god. You have a fucking girl
in there, don’t you?
HANK
No. Give a guy some credit. Maybe
he just laid down some serious wolfbait.
(off her look)
I took my morning dump, okay?
Reeks to high heaven in there.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 12.
JILL
Lovely.
HANK
It was, actually. An almost
perfect bowel movement. Clean as a
whistle. Barely had to wipe.
JILL
But you did, right?
HANK
Of course. What do you think I am?
An animal?
(off her look)
Okay, so what do you want to tell
me?
JILL
I’ve been doing some thinking.
HANK
Some over-thinking, you mean.
JILL
Shut up. I accept you.
HANK
Huh?
JILL
I accept you for who you are.
HANK
Thank you. I think.
JILL
You’re not listening, stupid. I
accept you for who you are. I
don’t want to change you. We’re
good together. Kid or no kid.
Snip or no snip. I want to be with
you. I’ve wasted years on the idea
of something. I was in love with
the idea of perfect love. But now
I’m in love with Hank Moody.
HANK
Yeah, but...
JILL
Don’t you dare “but” me right now.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 13.
She opens her jacket. She’s completely naked underneath.
Hank drops his coffee cup on the kitchen floor. It shatters.
HANK
Fuck!
A KNOCK at the door.
HANK
Fuck!!
(then)
Hold that very naked thought...
Hank goes to the door. Peeps through the peephole:
It’s FELICIA.
Hank goes back to Jill. Grabs her. Steers her toward
Becca’s room.
JILL
What are you doing? Who is it?
HANK
Felicia.
JILL
Fuck!!!
HANK
You said it, lady. Be cool.
Hank shoves her in Becca’s room and closes the door.
He goes to the front door and opens it to Felicia. She
smiles, nervous and giddy. Walks right in. Hank follows her
into the living room area.
FELICIA
Good morning.
HANK
Good morning to you.
FELICIA
I can’t stop thinking about it.
HANK
What?
(off her look)
Oh. That. You liked that, did
you?
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 14.
FELICIA
I did. That was some very intense
and powerful love-making, Hank.
(off his look)
What’s wrong?
HANK
I’m just not a big fan of that
phrase. Love-making. Making love.
I prefer fucking, banging, stuffing
maybe. Perhaps. Take your pick.
FELICIA
Well... so much for the afterglow.
HANK
So what can I do you for this AM?
FELICIA
I told him.
HANK
Him.
(horrified)
Please tell me that “him” is your
therapist.
FELICIA
No such luck, I’m afraid.
HANK
Why on earth would you do something
like that?
FELICIA
He knew, Hank. He saw it on my
face. The pure joy. The glow of a
freshly fucked and properly tendedto
woman. So I told him. Came
clean. Felt so good. It was the
right thing to do.
HANK
Jesus Fuck.
FELICIA
Jesus Fuck indeed. Guess what?
(off his fear)
I’m leaving him.
HANK
Oh no. Oh no you’re not.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 15.
FELICIA
Stacy and I just don’t make sense
anymore. We haven’t for quite some
time now. Life is short. I want
to spend the rest of my days with
someone I’m passionate about.
Someone who gives me butterflies.
For better or for worse, Hank, that
someone is you.
HANK
Whoa. Slow the fuck down. One
love-making session -- however
inspired and transcendent -- does
not a relationship make. What
about the Chelsea?
FELICIA
What about her?
HANK
No matter how bratty she is, the
wayward little snot doesn’t deserve
a broken home.
FELICIA
Oh, she’ll get over it. Becca has
clearly weathered the storm.
HANK
No, she hasn’t. She’s totally
fucked up, that kid. Karen and I
made a huge mistake. We should’ve
made it work at all costs. For her
sake. We were stubborn and foolish
and retarded and young... ish...
Felicia puts a finger to his lips, shushing him.
FELICIA
Why don’t you just shut up and make
love to me already?
(then)
Or you can fuck me, bang me, stuff
me. Take your pick.
At which point Charlie saunters out of bedroom, stripped down
to boxers and an unbuttoned dress shirt.
He nods at them, gives a cheerful little wave, heads right
for the fridge. Hunts around for a moment. Pulls out a
stick of butter.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 16.
FELICIA
Who is that?
HANK
That would be my agent.
(then)
Charlie Runkle, Felicia Koons.
CHARLIE
Oh, the dean’s wife. Lovely to
meet you, Mrs.
Charlie wipes his hand on his boxers before offering it to
her. They shake. She feels something unpleasant, wipes her
hand on her clothes.
FELICIA
Lovely to meet you...
Charlie goes back to the bedroom.
HANK
So where were we?
FELICIA
I was leaving my husband for you.
HANK
Right. Will you excuse me for a
moment?
Hank walks into
8 INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 8
quite the decadent scene:
Cigarette in his mouth, Rick Springfield is using the stick
of butter as an anal sex lubricant with the stripper.
And he’s pouring hot candle wax on her back.
Charlie, meanwhile, is receiving oral from the same girl.
Rick Springfield looks up at Hank with a depraved grin.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
You wanna get in on this?
HANK
You guys are fucking foul.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Ya sure? There’s an open hole...
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 17.
HANK
(to the stripper)
You okay, sweetheart?
She nods, clearly unfazed by it all.
STRIPPER
Don’t worry -- they’re paying for
it.
CHARLIE
Well, I’m paying for it.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
So I left my fucking wallet at
home. Sue me already. Jesus.
(to stripper)
Say it, baby. Say it.
STRIPPER
(bored)
I’m getting fucked by Rick
Springfield.
RICK SPRINGFIELD
Again. Say “in the ass” this time.
STRIPPER
(just as bored)
I’m getting fucked in the ass by
Rick Springfield.
As Rick Springfield starts singing one of his hits, Hank
averts his gaze and heads out to
9 THE BACK PATIO 9
where he finds Jackie texting on her Blackberry.
HANK
You okay out here? What are you
doing?
JACKIE
I’m writing.
HANK
Really? On that thing?
JACKIE
Sure, why not? I have a whole
novel on here. Almost. Hard to
tell.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 18.
HANK
I hope you’re capitalizing and
using proper punctuation.
JACKIE
Can we go yet?
HANK
Not yet. A few fires to put out
first.
JACKIE
Okay. Are you proud of me?
(off his look)
For quitting?
HANK
Absolutely. You done good. Keep
writing.
She smiles. Hank goes in
10 INT. HANK’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS 10
through the kitchen, stops dead in his tracks --
DEAN KOONS
is standing in the dining room. Looking around. Felicia
nowhere in sight. Koons turns, sees Hank. They meet
halfway.
DEAN KOONS
Hello, Hank.
HANK
Morning, Stacy.
DEAN KOONS
The front door was open.
HANK
Yeah, I’m very neighborly that way.
DEAN KOONS
You’ve never called me Stacy
before. I wonder why.
HANK
I don’t know. Just kinda rolled
trippingly off the tongue.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 19.
DEAN KOONS
Something must be different. Oh,
that’s right -- you fucked my wife.
HANK
Right. About that...
DEAN KOONS
What could you say, Hank? What
could you possibly say? To take
away the hurt and pain of being
cuckolded?
HANK
(thinks about it)
Nothing. I’ve got nothing. The
well is dry.
DEAN KOONS
Amazing. Never thought I’d see it
in my lifetime.
HANK
You can hit me if you want. Head,
gut, whatever. It’s only fair.
DEAN KOONS
I don’t want to hit you, Hank. I
just want to understand. How do
you do it?
HANK
Do what exactly?
DEAN KOONS
You obviously have this thing with
women. Some kind of special
connection. No matter what you do,
no matter how big of an ass you
are, they seem to respond. You’re
a goddamn Girl Whisperer.
HANK
Okay, have you listened to your
wife lately? She’s obviously a
woman scorned. I don’t mean to
speak of the dean’s business, but
it sounds like you hurt her first.
DEAN KOONS
You’re right about that. I did. I
was weak. I cheated. Stepped
outside my marriage. Humiliated my
better half.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 20.
(MORE)
But she was so hot, Hank. This
student of mine. You should’ve
seen her. A priest would’ve
defiled this girl.
Hank looks around for Felicia, nervous...
HANK
Wow. Maybe you keep those details
to yourself...
DEAN KOONS
Felicia is wonderful. A beautiful
wife and mother. I loved her the
moment I set eyes on her. I knew
she was the one. But she was
always a little reserved in the
sack. The British, you know.
There was never a surplus of oral.
And what little there was dried up
right after the wedding. I never
understood. A man likes getting
his dick sucked, ya know?
Felicia pops up from hiding, scaring the shit out of both of
them...
FELICIA
Well, maybe if you took a goddamn
shower once in a while. Do you
really a think a woman wants to go
down on a man who’s just walked in
off the tennis court? Or come from
a ride? Do you think I want to
peel off those sweaty bike shorts
and go to town? Disgusting.
DEAN KOONS
I’m sorry, Felicia, but that
happens to be when this man is at
his horniest. You know that.
FELICIA
Have you heard of compromise,
Stacy?!
HANK
See? There you go. Compromise. I
like where this is going.
FELICIA
Divorce court. That’s where it’s
going.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 21.
DEAN KOONS (CONT'D)
DEAN KOONS
And what are you doing here anyway?
A free pass means once! No repeat
business! This will be discussed
in therapy. Just you watch.
HANK
Excellent idea. Therapize the fuck
out of that shit.
DEAN KOONS
And you’re coming with us, Hank.
HANK
Ugh. No way. That sounds awful.
FELICIA
It is awful. You know how much of
my life I’ve wasted on that couch?
Pretending we can just jabber
through our issues? No more,
Stacy. No more. I’m in love with
someone else.
Ouch. Both Hank and Dean Koons react as though punched in
the face. Both for very different reasons, of course.
DEAN KOONS
Do you love my wife, Hank?
HANK
That’s a ridiculous question.
DEAN KOONS
What’s so ridiculous about it? She
seems to be in love with you. Do
you feel the same? Do you love
her?
HANK
Well... I mean... I’m quite fond of
her...
BECCA and CHELSEA enter the apartment. Chatting and
laughing. Stopping short when they see their parents. Hank
is only too happy for the interruption.
HANK
Well, what do we have here...?
BECCA
What are you doing home?
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 22.
HANK
Did they close the school? Snow
day perhaps?
CHELSEA
(to her parents)
What are you guys doing here?
DEAN KOONS
I believe that question should be
directed at you, young lady.
HANK
Copy that, motherfucker.
BECCA
I left one of my books here. I
needed it.
HANK
Uh-huh. Why didn’t you call me? I
would’ve been happy to bring it to
you.
Hank suddenly sees a way to get away, free and clear.
HANK
Let’s go, ya little guttersnipe.
No more double-talk. I’m taking
your lying, no-account ass right
back to school.
DEAN KOONS
Excellent idea. What he said.
Let’s go, Chelsea.
CHELSEA
Wait a second. Why are you guys
here?
FELICIA
If you must know, we were chatting
about you.
HANK
That’s right. How concerned we are
about your behaviors and such.
Looks like it wasn’t entirely
unfounded, no?
While Hank is talking, Becca heads off to her bedroom. Hank
notices a beat too late.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 23.
HANK
Becca! Wait!
Nope. Too late. She walks into her bedroom.
Hank watches the door. No calamity from within. He’s
hopeful. Becca walks out with her textbook. Crisis averted?
BECCA
Dad?
HANK
Yes?
BECCA
Why is there a naked lady in my
bedroom?
Hank sighs, busted.
Jill walks out in shame, jacket wrapped around her, hugely
embarrassed.
Shocked looks all around. Chelsea seems to be enjoying the
shit out of this.
CHELSEA
Way to go, Hank!
FELICIA
Oh my god. Have you been sleeping
with your TA this whole time?
While you were sleeping with me?
CHELSEA
What?! Mom! Dad?!
HANK
Well... to be fair... we only slept
together the once.
JILL
Bullshit.
HANK
Yeah, I was talking about me and
Felicia.
FELICIA
I counted three times.
HANK
All in one night doesn’t count.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 24.
CHELSEA
(to Becca)
Your dad fucked my mom!
(to Dean Koons)
Dad, what do you have to say about
this?
DEAN KOONS
I think this calls for a family
meeting.
Then the SMOKE ALARM goes off.
Charlie, Rick Springfield and the stripper pile out of the
bedroom. All in various states of undress.
Dean Koons looks at Felicia.
DEAN KOONS
Is that Rick Springfield?
RICK SPRINGFIELD
You bet your khaki-clad ass, white
man. You a fan?
(to Felicia)
What’s up, sweetheart?
Jackie wanders in through the kitchen, takes in the scene.
Jill and Felicia see her and react...
JILL
You’ve got to be shitting me.
Please tell me you didn’t fuck her,
too.
JACKIE
Why? Who else did he fuck? You?
Gross.
JILL
Hey, fuck you!
JACKIE
(to Chelsea)
You too?
CHELSEA
Gross! No way! He fucked my mom.
DEAN KOONS
Chelsea, watch your mouth!
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 25.
CHELSEA
Dad, man up and grow a pair
already. You’re just gonna let
this asshole steal your wife?
BECCA
Hey, watch who you call asshole.
That’s my father you’re talking
about.
Jackie shakes her head, looks at Hank.
JACKIE
I can’t believe I quit stripping
for you.
HANK
Hey, I still think it’s a good
move.
(then)
Now if you’ll all excuse me for a
moment... it appears I have an
actual fire to put out...
Hank grabs a fire extinguisher from the kitchen. Goes into
11 INT. HANK’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 11
where the candle Rick Springfield was using has ignited
something highly flammable.
Hank quickly puts out the fire.
He sees the stripper still passed out on his bed. Shakes
her, makes sure she’s okay. She groans in her sleep, grumpy.
Satisfied, he steels himself, goes back into:
12 INT. HANK’S PLACE - CONTINUOUS 12
Everyone is gone now. Save for Becca, that is. She’s
sitting on the couch in the living room. Troubled. He sits
down next to her.
HANK
We should probably get you back to
school.
BECCA
No way. I’m not going. Not today.
HANK
Come on, Becca. Don’t test me.
Not today.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 26.
BECCA
I can’t believe you slept with all
of them.
HANK
It’s not that simple, sweetheart.
BECCA
All of them.
HANK
I suppose I did, yeah.
BECCA
Why?
HANK
I don’t know.
BECCA
That’s not good enough. I want to
know why. There has to be a
reason. Make me understand.
HANK
It just sort of happened.
BECCA
Why do you do things like that?
HANK
Because I’m an idiot. Obviously.
BECCA
No. You’re not allowed to feel
sorry for yourself. Not right now.
You need to talk to me. You need
to tell me why you do the things
you do when you know that people
can get seriously hurt. Myself
included.
HANK
God, I hate it when you’re mad at
me.
BECCA
I’m not mad at you. You wouldn’t
get mad at a big, dumb dog for
shitting on the rug, would you?
HANK
Yay me.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 27.
BECCA
I’m not mad, Dad. Just
disappointed. But I guess I’m
getting used to it.
HANK
Jesus. Put a plastic bag over my
head and get it over with already.
That would be less painful.
BECCA
How do you think I feel? I know
your heart’s always in the right
place -- sort of -- but I can’t
ever trust you to do the right
thing. Do you have any idea how
scary that is for a kid?
HANK
New York will be different. A new
chapter for all of us. You’ll see.
BECCA
Right. Mañana. The sun’ll come
out mañana.
(then)
What do you want me to take away
from this? From how you treat
women? Is that all they are to
you? Walking vaginas?
HANK
Look, there’s no excuse for my
behavior. I can’t defend myself if
someone got hurt. Especially
you... my favorite and my best.
But I need you to know that it all
started with the best of
intentions.
(then)
I guess I just wanted them to know
that I saw it. The thing that
makes them special. That’s all
anyone wants, right? To be seen?
To be recognized? But then the
lines got blurry. And the fact
that your mom and I are in such a
weird place right now made
everything all the more confusing.
Hence the big, stinking mess.
(then)
I’m sorry I let you down, sweets.
CALIFORNICATION EP.308 PRODUCTION DRAFT 6/2/09 28.
BECCA
I know you are.
HANK
And I don’t know how many times I
can say I’m sorry before it doesn’t
mean anything anymore.
BECCA
I don’t know either. But I have
this funny feeling we’ll find out.
They sit in silence for a moment. The PHONE RINGS. Hank
answers.
HANK
Hello? Oh, she’s fine. Not to
worry. Yeah, I talked to her.
She...
Becca looks at him, expecting the worst.
HANK
...she’s at school. All is well.
I’ll pick her up later. We’ll get
some ice cream... go down to the
beach... it’ll be just like old
times...
Hank puts his arm around his daughter. Brings her close.
Becca lays her head on his shoulder.
HANK
Okay... we’ll call you later. Love
you. Bye.
Hank hangs up. They just sit there. Both of them too
melancholy to talk. Besides, what’s left to say at this
point?
And that’s when the formerly semi-conscious stripper stumbles
out of Hank’s bedroom, hair shooting out at odd angles...
She’s dazed, confused, and all kinds of naked...
STRIPPER #2
Where’s my fucking clothes...?
A moment. Hank looks at Becca and we...

WOODY
What are you doing, Mr. Peterson?
NORM
I'm cleaning out my pockets, Woody.
WOODY
Can I watch?
NORM
It might not be pretty.
WOODY
That's okay. I have a strong

NORM
All right, then, so far we have
lots of Kleenex, a ticket stub from
the movie "Any Which Way But
Loose," and keys to God knows what.
WOODY
Wow. This is like opening a time

NORM
We also have a checkbook from an
account that's been closed for two
years, and a crumpled pack of
Luckies.

Norm, I didn't know you smoked.

Well, I must have, unless these

WOODY
What is it, Sam?
SAM (CONT'D)
Open it and see. All right,
everybody, I know how you think I'm
a little behind the times, so I
thought I'd spend some money and
prove that Cheers is just as hip as
any bar in Boston. Especially, now
that we've got... Pong!
CLIFF
Yes!
REBECCA
We're inches away from bankruptcy,
and you spent money on a game
nobody's played in fifteen years?
SAM
It was a steal. The company's
going out of business. Besides,
these things are addictive. We'll
be raking in the dough big time.
WOODY REMOVES THE LAST OF THE CRATE TO REVEAL NOT A VIDEO
G~E, BUT A SLOT MACHINE. ALL GATHER AROUND IT.

Wait a minute. This isn't Pong.

WOODY
What is this thing?
CLIFF
Come on, Woody, surely you've seen
the old one-armed bandit.
WOODY
sure, Mr. Clavin, in the Hanover
prison. Talk about scared
straight. I could live to be
eighty, and I'll never try to steal
a rottweiler. Of course, we could
never understand why anyone would
try to steal a rottweiler in
Hanover, since they roam free
anyway. (RE SLOT MACHINE) so, what
is this thing?
NORM
This, Woody, is a slot machine.
Allow me to demonstrate. You take
a nickel--
REBECCA
Hold it right there, Norm. Nobody
plays this thing. Back to your

There's a game. Pure science.

Luck can be bested by intelligence.
Of course, Lilith didn't buy that
crap when I lost half our savings
in Reno last year, but hey, baby
needed a new pair of shoes.
MEANWHILE, NORM IS APPROACHED BY ANOTHER MAN, DON .
DON
Excuse me, sir, I'm doing a survey.
NORM
(INDICATING DEBRIS) I'm sorta busy.
DON
In that case, could you point me to
someone who drinks a lot of beer?
We're conducting a taste test.
NORM CRAMS THE GARBAGE BACK INTO HIS POCKETS.

DON
Gentlemen, you've been selected to
take part in this study due to your
ages and drinking habits. Norm,
there seems to be a typo on your
average beer intake.
NORM CHECKS THE CLIPBOARD AND SHAKES HIS HEAD. NO TYPO.
DON (CONT'D)
Wow. (THEN) Okay, let's get a basic
customer profile. Ray, what do you
do?
RAY
I'm a civil engineer.
DON
Very good. Chuck?

CHUCK
I'm sort of between jobs. I mostly
hang out, watch TV, and drink beer.
NORM
Same here.
DON
Alrighty, now if each of you--
RAY
Excuse me. I'm not a civil
engineer. I guess I was just too
embarrassed to say I was
unemployed. Sorry.
DON
Okay, fine. Now, if each of you
could tell me in what social
context you drink the most beer;
family gatherings, social gettogethers,
etcetera. Ray?
RAY
Usually, I'll go out with my wife
and have a few.
CHUCK
Not me. My wife never understood
when it came to me and beer. So I
drink it with my friends .

You're not very comfortable with

Gentlemen, Our first sample --all

NORM
I want to be accurate.
DON
Ray, what did you think? Would you
drink this beer in your home?
RAY
Pretty good. I'd serve it at home.
DON
Chuck?
CHUCK
Real good. Good aftertaste.
DON
And Norm?
NORM
Well, I guess this is where we
separate the men from the boys. I
felt it was a little sweet, but
kind of hollow. You know, like
they used some kind of imitation
corn mash. It's something people
won't notice at first, but after a
few, it'll be less satisfying.

Ah, beachwood aged. Only this is

"Rubber soul". Too much work.

PAUL
We still see the slot machine. Try
moving the plant to the left.
REBECCA BENDS OVER AGAIN, TO MOVE THE PLANT OVER. PAUL AND

CARLA
Maybe you should plug it in. You
know, make sure you didn't break it
in the move.
REBECCA
sure, Carla, and then a cop walks
in, and I'm in jail. No thanks.
CARLA
I'm just saying, if it's broke,
you'll want to know, so you can fix
it before they make you pay for it.
REBECCA
You have a point there. (THEN)
Okay, watch for police.

unplug this thing?
CARLA

I'm not allowed to let you buy
rounds. It costs too much and

MIKE

NORM
No, sir, but three times a day, I
face it and pray.

machine?

I called them, and they can't get

You know, Rebecca, there might be a
way you can get it out. Nah,
forget it.
REBECCA
What is it? Come on, tell me.
CARLA
Well, I was thinking, maybe you
could try putting in another
nickel. You were real close last
time. Maybe this time it would pay
off and you'd win your money back .
REBECCA
Forget it, Carla. It's illegal,
and besides, there's no guarantee.
CARLA
You're going to have the guy open
it up tomorrow anyway. What's the
difference if he fishes out one
nickel or two? Besides, if you win
it back, you won't have to explain
why you put the first nickel in
there.

CARLA
That's strange. You let the handle
snap back and everything?
REBECCA
What do you mean?
CARLA
You're supposed to let the handle
snap back. Haven't you ever been
to Atlantic city? they say
sometimes it jars the machine into
paying off, but it's probably just
an old wives tale.
REBECCA
Well, I have one nickel left, and
three's always been my lucky
number.
CARLA
Really?
REBECCA
Well, except once when I was
watching a Little League game and a

Not that it matters. I lost fair

you. I've sampled beer with every
possible variation of ingredients.
I advise top brewers on technique,
and I get paid a nice amount of

money for my opinion. If I say
this is swill, then you can rest
assured it's swill, and I won't
grace my bar tab with it.
SAM
What about the fifty thousand
dollars worth of swill you drank
earlier?
NORM
Are you going to change that keg or
not?
NORM RISES AND HEADS FOR THE EXIT. •
•
No!
SAM
•
NORM
Fine. I don't need this. I can
get all the beer I want, and get
paid on top of that. At least at
the brewery, my opinion counts. So
long, suckers!
NORM EXITS. ALL WATCH HIM GO IN STUNNED SILENCE. CLIFF
SIPS HIS BEER.
CLIFF
Actually, sammy, now that I taste
it again, I do taste a slight
unevenness in the hydrogen
distribution--

SAM
Shut up, Cliff.
REBECCA ENTERS FROM THE OFFICE, WEARING HER COAT.
REBECCA
Well, I'm out of here, everybody.
Goodnight!
SHE EXITS THE BAR, AND STARTS UP THE STAIRS. SHE TURNS AND
RE ENTERS THE BAR. SHE CROSSES TO CARLA AND SLAPS TWO
DOLLARS ON THE BAR.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
Give me a roll of nickels.
CARLA WORDLESSLY HANDS HER A ROLL OF NICKELS, WHICH SHE HAD
READY AND WAITING. REBECCA CROSSES TO THE SLOT MACHINE,
PULLS UP A STOOL, AND STARTS FEEDING IT WITH NICKELS. PAUL

INT. BREWERY - THE NEXT MORNING
MIKE IS SITTING AT HIS DESK, GOING OVER PAPERS, AS NORM
ENTERS, CARRYING A LUNCH BOX.
NORM
Hey, Mike.
NORM CLOCKS IN, OPENS A SMALL LOCKER, OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX,
PULLS OUT HIS MUG, THEN CLOSES THE EMPTY LUNCH BOX AND PUTS
IT IN THE LOCKER. HE STARTS FOR THE BREWERY EXIT.
MIKE
Just a minute, Norm, I need to talk
to you.
NORM
Did I do something wrong?
MIKE
No. You're good. You're very
good. But sometimes, you don't
have to be so good. You know what
I mean?
•
•
•
NORM SHAKES HIS HEAD.
MIKE (CONT'D)
(RE PAPER) Tuesday, vats four
through seven. According to you,
there was a slight barley to hops
ratio imbalance.
NORM
Well, there was.
MIKE
Oh, I don't doubt you. But the
thing is, who's really going to
taste that? I sure as hell
couldn't. And the cost to throw it
away was a little high.
NORM
Wait a minute. Are you saying that
if I have a problem I should look
the other way, so you can save a
few bucks?
MIKE
Let's just say you could be a
little less picky. Look, Norm,
You've got a good thing going here.
Don't screw it up.
NORM
I can't believe this•
38
•
•
•
MIKE
What's the big deal? It's just
beer.
NORM
Just beer? Just beer? Let me tell
you a little story, pal. When I
was a little kid, my father and I
never really had anything in
common. We never talked. We lived
with my mom in a tiny apartment
building with no air conditioning.
In the summer, it would get so hot
that at night everyone would sleep
out on their fire escapes. Anyway,
my dad drove a cab. A miserable,
sweaty little cab. Six days a
week. Then on Sundays, he and his
friends would gather in our living
room to watch the fights and share
some cold beer. And from the
kitchen, I'd watch them laughing,
and talking, and yelling at the TV,
and I knew how important this time
was for them.
MIKE
Very moving .
39
•
•
•
NORM
I'm not done. Well, one Sunday
morning, I got up and found the
refrigerator was on the blink. It
was already getting hot, and my
dad's beer was starting to warm up.
So I rode my bike to the dairy and
started filling an orange crate
with ice. I made three trips
before I had enough to keep the
beer cold. When my dad saw what I
did, he put his arm around me and
told me I was all right. He even
let me watch the fights with him.
That day I realized that beer is
the common denominator. The
wrecking ball that tears down the
walls between people. I'm sorry,
Mike, but if Norm Peterson comes
across an imperfect brew, it will
be reported, and no budget hound is
going to stop me!
MIKE
That was beautiful. You're fired.
NORM
What, you didn't like my little
play?
NO RESPONSE.

NORM (CONTrD)
Come on, don't you know when a
guy's kidding around?
MIKE
I'm sorry, Norm. Your principles
are just too strong.
MIKE OPENS THE DOOR FOR HIM.
NORM
Please let me stay. I can play the
game. The stuff could be poison,
I'll let it go. Please?
MIKE IS UNMOVED. SADLY, NORM GETS HIS LUNCH BOX AND EXITS,
AS WE:

INT. BAR - A SHORT TIME LATER
THE BAR IS DARK. SAM UNLOCKS THE DOOR AND ENTERS, FOLLOWED
BY WOODY AND CARLA. IT'S TIME TO OPEN THE BAR.
CARLA
Let's get some lights on in here.
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE SLOT MACHINE'S HANDLE BEING PULLED.
SAM
What the hell is that?
HE TURNS ON ALL THE LIGHTS, AND WE SEE REBECCA AT THE SLOT
MACHINE. SHE IS STILL WEARING THE COAT FROM LAST NIGHT, AND
HAS A CIGARETTE HANGING OUT OF HER MOUTH. IT IS OBVIOUS SHE
HASN'T GONE HOME. SHE DAZEDLY WATCHES THE WHEELS SPIN.
REBECCA
Damn.
SAM (CONT'D)
Rebecca, how long have you been
here?
REBECCA
Sam! Aren't you going home?
•
•
•
SHE INSERTS A NICKEL AND PULLS THE HANDLE.
SAM
I've been home. How much money have
you put in there?
REBECCA
(RE MACHINE) Damn. (TO SAM) Not
much. About six hundred dollars.
SAM
Where did you get six hundred
dollars in nickels?
REBECCA
Carla was nice enough to sell me a
whole bunch last night.
CARLA
It was the least I could do •
SHE WANDERS AWAY, CHUCKLING.
SAM
(TO REBECCA) Alright, honey, pack
it up. Let's go.
REBECCA
Not yet, Sam. This stupid machine
still hasn't hit. It's got to, one
of these times. (PUTTING IN A
NICKEL) Well, twelve thousandth
time's the charm.
SHE PULLS.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
Damn.

AS SHE FEEDS ANOTHER NICKEL IN, NORM ENTERS.
NORM
'Morning, everybody.
NO RESPONSE.
NORM (CONT'D)
(WEAKLY) Norm!
HE SLINKS TO THE BAR.
NORM (CONT'D)
Hey, Woody, how about a beer?
SAM
I'm sorry, sir, we only have swill
here.
NORM
Come on, Sammy, quit kidding
around. It's me, Norm .
SAM
(TO CARLA AND WOODY) Well, look,
who's graced our lowly bar with his
presence. It's Norm Peterson,
adviser to master brewers.
NORM
Not anymore. I lost my job.
SAM
So now you just expect to waltz
back in here like nothing happened?
NORM
You're offended, aren't you Sam?
44
•
•
•
SAM
How could you tell? Oh, let me
guess --you tasted it!
NORM
Look, you guys, I'm really sorry.
I guess I was kind of an ass.
CARLA
Good guess.
NORM
It's just that I was never really
good at anything. I'm not a babe
hound like you, or a big doctor
like Frasier, or even a proud
working man like Cliff. I was a
lousy accountant and an even
lousier painter. But there was
always one thing I could do, and
that was drink beer. And for
awhile, it looked like I'd finally
found my calling. And maybe I got
a little carried away. Forgive me?
SAM
Well, I suppose if I don't, you'll
just start hanging out at Gary's.
NORM
Are you kidding? After the things
I said in there?
45

SAM SERVES NORM A BEER.
How's that?
NORM TAKES A SIP .
SAM
NORM

Well, it's a little sour...
SAM
That'll be two fifty.
NORM
Actually, I like it better this
way.
TWO POLICEMEN ENTER.
SAM
Can I help you gentlemen?
COP #1
Yes, we got a tip that there's an
illegal slot machine in this
building.
REBECCA HAS JUST INSERTED A COIN AND STARTED TO PULL THE
HANDLE. SHE FREEZES.
SAM
Who told you that?
COP #2
We didn't get a name. We only know
it was a female who kept chuckling.
COP #1
Is there a slot machine in here?
SAM
As a matter of fact--
•
•
•
47
REBECCA
. No!
THE POLICE LOOK AT HER.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
I mean there was. But it's gone.
Someone took it. Now, it's not
here.
COP #1
(SUSPICIOUSLY) What are you doing
back there?
REBECCA
Just ... hanging up my coat.
SHE WHIPS OFF HER COAT AND HANGS IT ON THE HANDLE. SHE
STARTS TO LEAD THEM TO THE EXIT.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
sorry to have wasted your time,
gentlemen, but I'm afraid you've
been sent on a wild goose chase.
AS THEY GET CLOSER TO THE EXIT, WE SEE THAT THE WEIGHT OF
REBECCA'S COAT IS PULLING ON THE SLOT MACHINE'S HANDLE.
REBECCA (CONT'D)
No, unfortunately you'll have to go·
back empty-handed. I can't believe
someone would lead you on like
that, but the whole idea's
ridiculous. There isn't a slot
machine within a hundred miles of
this place.

48
THE HANDLE PULLED, THE MACHINE HITS, AND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
WORTH OF NICKELS BEGIN TO ERUPT FROM THE MACHINE, AS A BIG
RED LIGHT BEGINS SPINNING WILDLY. EVERYONE IN THE BAR
WATCHES THIS SIGHT. CARLA CALMLY WALKS OVER TO THE MOUNTAIN
OF NICKELS GROWING ON THE FLOOR AND PICKS UP A NICKEL, WHICH
SHE HOLDS OUT TO REBECCA.
CARLA
Here's your nickel.
REBECCA SMILES WEAKLY AT THE COPS AND WE:
CUT TO BLACK.
OVER BLACK, WE HEAR THE SOUND OF COINS DROPPING OUT OF THE
MACHINE AS CARLA CHUCKLES.

COMMUNITY

Dan Harmon
January 28th, 2009
COLD OPEN
FADE IN:
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
The campus of a large but humble community college a few
miles from your home. Cambridge bells chime.
Actually, the bells are playing on an old boom box, which is
now stopped by Dean PELTON [40s, rotund], who is holding a
microphone hooked up to it. He is on a small stage at the
front of the courtyard.
He starts to speak into the microphone, realizes it’s not
working and fiddles with the boombox switches. He begins to
speak, but a Busta Rhymes cd starts playing instead:
BUSTA RHYMES
(on cd)
Yo. I’m high as hell right now,
and I’m about to bust your ass
open, but first -
Pelton, an apparently humorless man, frantically figures out
how to stop the cd, then addresses the students.
PELTON
Good morning. Many of you are
halfway through your first week
here at Greendale and, as dean, I
thought I would share a word of
inspiration.
Pelton reads from a small stack of index cards:
PELTON (CONT’D)
What is Community College? Well,
you’ve heard all kinds of things.
You’ve heard it’s “loser college”
for young people who couldn’t make
the cut at a university.
ANNIE [18, tightly wound, sweater vest] is walking through
the courtyard when she hears this, causing her to stop.
TROY [18, letter jacket, All American], is seated on a bench
with a breakfast burrito. He looks up, a little put-off.
PELTON (CONT’D)
It’s “halfway school” for
twentysomething dropouts, crawling
back to society with unskilled
tails between their legs.
BRITTA [late 20s, sweatshirt, pony tail, unadorned and
accidentally hot], is interrupted in her confident stride by
what she’s hearing. She stops and looks as if called by
name.
PELTON (CONT’D)
A tax-funded self esteem workshop
for newly divorced housewives
piecing together shattered
identities,
SHIRLEY [early 40s, shy, modest 90s attire], was briskly
crossing the courtyard, eyes cast downward. She stops and
looks toward the stage.
PELTON (CONT’D)
and old people hoping to keep their
minds active as they circle the
drain of eternity.
PIERCE [50s, prescription sunglasses, turtleneck, sport
jacket], was talking to a group of young people, but stops.
In fact, Pelton now has the undivided attention of most of
the pedestrians in the courtyard.
PELTON (CONT’D)
That’s what you’ve heard. However:
He flips to the next index card.
PELTON (CONT’D)
I wish you luck. Wait -
Confused, Pelton flips through his cards as the slightly
deflated students resume their activity. Pelton calls out to
them.
PELTON (CONT’D)
There was... a middle part of that
speech, if you see a card...
Walking amongst the rest of the students and not thrilled to
be doing so: JEFF Crocker, [30s, well dressed, dashing but
rough around the edges]. He is paced and orbited by ABED
[20s, Arabic, “geek chic” Weezer fan clothes], who seems
generally intrigued by everything all the time.
ABED
I’m only half Arabic, actually, my
Dad is Palestinian, I mean, he’s a
U.S.
2.
(MORE)
Citizen and he’s not a threat to
national security or anything, a
lot of people want to know that
after they meet him, because he has
an angry energy, but not like angry
at America, just angry at my Mom
for leaving him, although she did
leave because he was angry, and he
was angry because she was American.
My name’s Abed, by the way.
JEFF
Abed, nice to know you, and then
meet you, in that order. Now about
that question I had.
ABED
Oh.
(looks at watch)
Five after eleven. When you asked.
JEFF
Thanks. I’ll talk to you in a few
months, if that’s cool.
ABED
Oh. Few months. Okay.
Abed starts to walk away but Jeff puts a hand on his
shoulder.
JEFF
Hey, let me ask you.
Jeff pulls Abed closer and indicates someone in the distance:
It’s Britta, heading into the cafeteria.
JEFF (CONT’D)
The hot girl from Spanish class,
what’s her deal, I can’t find a
road in there.
ABED
Well, I’ve only talked to her once
while she was borrowing a pencil,
but her name’s Britta, she’s 28,
birthday in October, she has two
older brothers and one of them
works with children who have a
disorder I might want to look up.
Oh, and she thinks she’s going to
flunk tomorrow’s quiz so she really
needs to focus and she’s sorry if
that makes her seem cold.
3.
ABED (CONT'D)
JEFF
Abed, I see your value, now.
ABED
That’s the nicest thing anyone’s
ever said to me.
CUT TO:
INT. CAFETERIA
Britta moves down a food line, assembling her meal from bins
of saran wrapped items. Jeff gets in line next to her.
JEFF
Oh, hey. Spanish.
BRITTA
Yeah, just don’t hit on me, okay?
JEFF
Whoa.
BRITTA
And as you walk away, don’t call me
a lesbian or say “don’t flatter
yourself.”
JEFF
Anything I should do?
BRITTA
You should not hit on me.
JEFF
Listen, I just wanted to let you
know about my Spanish study group.
BRITTA
The guy that spent today’s class
playing Bejeweled on his iphone has
a study group? Am I allowed to
sign up twice?
JEFF
I’m taking that class for the easy
credit. I actually tutor Spanish.
She turns to him. On the hook but suspicious.
BRITTA
Say that in Spanish. Now.
4.
Jeff sighs, shouldering her cynicism with grace, and uses
gestures to indicate his mind, school and language:
JEFF
Duermo tarde Espanol, una hora mas,
no rayar mi coche.
Subtitle: I sleep late Spanish, one more hour, do not
scratch my car. She squints. Then surrenders.
BRITTA
I really need help with Spanish.
JEFF
I was willing to bet. I’m Jeff.
The group meets in the library at
six.
BRITTA
I’ll be there. I’m Britta. Thank
you so much, this is great.
Britta finishes paying for her food and walks away. Jeff
turns to the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN at the cash register.
JEFF
Technically, I am in college, so
it’s okay to use a college move,
right?
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
Huh?
JEFF
Sorry. I was raised on TV, I think
every black woman over fifty is a
cosmic mentor with free advice.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
How about for two twenty five you
can have your damn tacos.
JEFF
Yes ma’am.
Jeff gets out his wallet.
FADE OUT.
5.
ACT I
FADE IN:
INT. SCIENCES BUILDING - DUNCAN’S OFFICE
Psychology Professor DUNCAN [30s, low calibre hippy] is
working at his desk in a small office lined with plants,
books and weird art. Jeff appears in his doorway.
JEFF
You’re a hard man to reach,
Professor.
Duncan takes a moment to place the face.
DUNCAN
Jeff Crocker? Attorney at law?
He stands and shakes Jeff’s hand.
JEFF
You remember.
DUNCAN
How could I forget? I still can’t
figure out how you got a jury to
connect September 11th with my DUI.
Let alone why it helped.
JEFF
2002 was a simpler time.
DUNCAN
What’s my lawyer doing on campus?
JEFF
I’m a student.
DUNCAN
That can’t be an inspiring journey.
Duncan goes to a dorm-sized fridge and grabs two beers.
JEFF
Eh, those ivy league twits on the
state bar have had me under a
microscope since I started.
They’ve suddenly decided that even
though I have a law degree, my
college degree isn’t “legitimate.”
Duncan hands Jeff one of the beers.
6.
DUNCAN
I thought you had a bachelor’s from
Columbia.
JEFF
And now I have to get one from
America. They must have noticed
the eagle in the seal was holding
coffee branches. I’m dead in the
water until I replace that degree.
DUNCAN
If you’re in my class, I hope
you’re not going to ask for special
treatment.
JEFF
Professor, please, I do have rules.
I would never take psychology, it’s
boring. But I was hoping that, as
a teacher, you could get me all the
quizzes, tests and exams for the
classes I am taking this semester.
Jeff places a sheet of paper on Duncan’s desk.
DUNCAN
Jeff, you just described - no,
defined cheating. Not only is it
illegal, it’s unethical.
He takes a drink of his own beer.
JEFF
Well, laws are tools. We reshape
them to suit the job. And you
seemed less concerned with ethics
the day I convinced twelve of your
peers that when you did a U turn on
a freeway and tried to order
chalupas from an emergency call
box, your only real crime was being
an American.
DUNCAN
You’re saying I owe you.
JEFF
I’m not saying that. I’m giving
you pieces of a puzzle, which, when
put together, form a picture of you
owing me.
Duncan gets somber. He surrenders.
7.
DUNCAN
I’ll look into it.
Jeff heads for the door.
JEFF
I’ll be in the library at six, but
by 6:20, my fake study group will
not have shown up and I’ll have to
take a very hot girl to dinner.
DUNCAN
Oh, Jeff. Don’t lie to women.
JEFF
(doesn’t care)
Whoops!
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - STUDY ROOM
Jeff is seated at a big table, reading a Spanish text book.
JEFF
(repeating)
Bienvenido. Bienvenido.
Britta walks in. He smiles.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Bienvenido! Have a seat.
Jeff puts a notepad in front of her while she gets settled at
the room’s large table.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You can put your contact info on
here. I guess the group is running
late, but we can get acquainted.
She writes some stuff on the pad.
BRITTA
You may have noticed this morning,
I’m not great at small talk.
JEFF
I want to talk big. I want to
know, what’s your deal?
BRITTA
That’s not small talk?
8.
JEFF
What’s your deal and IS GOD DEAD?!
BRITTA
Alright. My deal. I dropped out
of high school to pursue my love of
anarchy. I made a lot of new
friends vandalizing billboards, I
helped coordinate us into a very
large, successful movement of
anarchist billboard vandals, and we
decided I was the leader, which
meant we had to kick me out,
because we were anarchists. Soon
after, they became an advertising
firm. One of their shampoo
billboards is across the street.
JEFF
The one that says “hey, it’s your
hair, we just want to clean it?”
BRITTA
Power to the people. And you can
go on Facebook and see photos of
their children, who have names like
Hemingway and Chomsky and who are
seated in the backs of SUVs. So I
guess my deal is, be honest with me
and I’ll like you. Because I may
be broke and “crawling back to
society” but I’m doing it having
learned that what’s most important
to me is honesty.
JEFF
(concern)
Good thing to learn.
BRITTA
What’s most important to you?
JEFF
I would say...honesty, because...
(surrender)
I would say anything to get what I
want and I want you to like me.
BRITTA
Very honest answer. So you get
your wish. I like you fine.
Jeff blinks.
9.
JEFF
Oh.
BRITTA
Yeah, see how easy.
JEFF
That’s it, huh? No Looney Tunes
character tattooed on your hip I
have to pretend to love?
BRITTA
Not me. Buy me dinner, don’t lie
to me and we’ll be in bed before
midnight.
The two of them chuckle at her joke.
JEFF
- All kidding aside, if you’re
hungry -
Abed enters. Britta looks as though she was expecting him.
BRITTA
Abed’s in the house! Whoooo!
JEFF
(good fake enthusiasm)
Whooooo, Abed! Also whyyyyy?
ABED
Britta invited me, is that cool?
JEFF
(plastered smile)
I can’t think of a single logical
reason why not. Have a seat. And
put your contact info here.
Abed sits down to write on the notepad.
ABED
Cool cool cool cool.
(while writing)
Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast
Club, huh?
BRITTA
(supporting it)
We’re in a library.
With great precision, Jeff reads Abed’s cell number while
punching it into his own phone under the table.
10.
ABED
Well, yeah, and we’re students,
from different backgrounds, and I’m
sure we’ve each got a thing, like
an issue, all balled up inside of
us that would make us cry if we
talked about it.
Jeff thumbs something into his phone.
BRITTA
Do you have something balled up
inside you want to talk about?
ABED
(thinks about it)
Oh, I got a little doozy in the
chamber I can let loose if things
get emotional.
Abed’s phone beeps. His reaction makes Jeff nervous.
ABED (CONT’D)
Whoa! Text message. Let’s give
this bad boy a read.
Abed picks up his phone.
JEFF
I’m sure it’s personal -
ABED
- No, I don’t know this person.
(clears throat)
“Say you have to pee I need to talk
to you.”
Jeff pretends to digest it along with the other two, all of
them exchanging confused looks.
ABED (CONT’D)
“Say you have to pee?”
BRITTA
Weird.
JEFF
Yeah. Creepy.
Professor Duncan ducks his head into the room, sees Jeff,
then sees the others.
DUNCAN
Jeffrey, a quick word? About
psychology?
11.
JEFF
I’ll be right back. When it’s
about psychology, it’s urgent.
Jeff heads for the door.
BRITTA
What if the group shows up?
JEFF
They’ll know what to do.
CUT TO:
EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DUSK
A motley crew of would-be athletes are trying out for the
apparently all-ages track team. Currently, a ninety year old
man is prepping himself on the starting line.
Jeff and Duncan are standing out in the middle of the field.
DUNCAN
I could get fired for having this
conversation, so act like you’re
watching the athletic proceedings.
JEFF
You couldn’t stop me from watching.
There is a man trying out for your
track team that is older than the
game of poker.
(noticing)
And he’s kinda truckin’.
DUNCAN
Suppose I did feel indebted to you,
Jeff. And suppose I said it was
possible to get you these answers.
JEFF
I’d say go for it. And, for future
reference, you can ask me stuff
like that way closer to wherever
we’re originally standing.
DUNCAN
I’m asking if you understand the
difference between right and wrong.
12.
JEFF
I understand “right” and “wrong”
are slippery slopes that end with
presidents who don’t believe
dinosaurs existed. And I’ve
understood since I was a kid that
if I talked long enough, I could
make anything true. So either I’m
God or truth is relative, and in
either case: booyah.
DUNCAN
Interesting. The average person
has a harder time saying “booyah”
to moral relativism.
JEFF
Ian, you don’t have to play shrink
to protect your pride, I accept
that you’re a chicken.
DUNCAN
Are you trying to use reverse
psychology on a psychologist?
JEFF
I’m just using normal psychology on
a pussy.
DUNCAN
You can’t talk to me that way!
JEFF
A six year old girl could talk to
you that way!
DUNCAN
Because it would be adorable!
JEFF
No, because you’re a five year old
girl, and there’s a pecking order!
DUNCAN
FINE, I’LL DO IT!
COACH BARTEL (O.S.)
- Gentlemen.
COACH BARTEL [stocky, 40s] is approaching their exchange.
13.
COACH BARTEL (CONT’D)
This is an athletic field, not a
rehearsal of Glengarry Glen Ross,
and I should know, because I run
both the Sports and Theatre
departments. Take it elsewhere.
Jeff and Duncan start walking off the field together. Coach
Bartel calls after them:
COACH BARTEL (CONT’D)
Either of you guys play football?
It’s looking that bad this year.
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - STUDY ROOM
Jeff enters, feigning disappointment.
JEFF
Well, I just found out that the
rest of the group -
Britta is not at the table, but Abed is, along with four new
students: Pierce, Shirley, Troy and Annie. They look at him.
JEFF (CONT’D)
- is here?
ABED
Britta’s in the bathroom, I think,
and I invited more people from
Spanish class, is that cool?
Jeff raises a fist that immediately becomes a thumbs-up.
JEFF
It’s the coolest. I should go to
the bathroom, too. And I should
bring my jacket, keys and wallet in
case there’s a fire.
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - LOBBY
Jeff is on his way to the exit doors. He nearly collides
with Britta, who is entering the lobby.
BRITTA
Ah. Busted.

I barely smoke. But that group is
getting big, made me skittish, I
started craving a grit.
JEFF
Same here. I saw those faces and I
just had to ...suck a ..leaf tube,
(hail Mary)
Maybe you and I would get more
studying done over -
Britta laughs at the proposition.
BRITTA
- Dinner? Come on, we both know
that’s when the studying stops.
Let’s do this thing first.
She starts walking away, then adds:
BRITTA (CONT’D)
If it really turns out to be a
train wreck, we’ll slip out early.
She walks away. Jeff mulls this over.
JEFF
Oh. I can do a train wreck.
OLD BLACK WOMAN (O.S.)
What a tangled web we weave.
Jeff is startled to see the old black woman from the
cafeteria next to him in the lobby. She’s placing books on a
cart, unloading the overnight return bin.
JEFF
Don’t you work in the cafeteria?
OLD BLACK WOMAN
I have many jobs. In many places.
Jeff’s jaw drops. She rolls her eyes at him.
OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT’D)
I’m not magical, I’m underpaid.
You racist jackass.
JEFF
Sorry.
Jeff heads back to the study room, ready for action.
FADE OUT.
15.
BRITTA (CONT'D)
ACT II
FADE IN:
INT. STUDY ROOM
Jeff settles into his chair at the head of the table. He
looks around the room. There’s Britta, there’s Abed, there’s
Annie the type-A teen, Troy the meat head jock, Shirley the
closed-up ex-housewife and Pierce the weird old man with
neatly brushed grey hair and some kind of stone around his
neck he must have bought at a tarot card store.
JEFF
Alllll right. Look at this crew.
Alllll ready to study alllll night.
Everyone concurs.
JEFF (CONT’D)
But who studies with strangers,
right? We’re all in the same
class and we don’t even know each
other, my name is Jeff.
Pierce speaks. He talks kind of like George Takei.
PIERCE
Jeff, it’s a pleasure, my name is
Pierce Hawthorne and yes, that is
Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes,
the award winning moist towelette.
JEFF
I was just going to ask.
PIERCE
I’m also a Rotarian and no stranger
to public speaking so maybe I
should make the introductions. You
already know Britter. Brittles?
BRITTA
Britta.
PIERCE
My apologies Britta, you also know
A-bed, A-bed the A-reb, is that
inappropriate?
ABED
(as if asked to get ice)
Sure.
16.
PIERCE
We’ve got Roy, Roy, the wonder boy
I call him, -
TROY
- Troy.
PIERCE
You are correct, and little
princess Elizabeth, -
ANNIE
Annie.
PIERCE
Very sorry, and finally this
beautiful creature’s name is
Shirley.
JEFF
(to Shirley)
Is that even close?
Shirley nods.
PIERCE
One does not forget Shirley, she is
a very, very fascinating, very
gorgeous young woman.
Shirley does not appear to enjoy the flattery. Jeff makes a
mental note. Annie speaks up.
ANNIE
I’d like to know why I had to find
out about this group on accident.
ABED
Oh, this is getting way more like
Breakfast Club, now.
BRITTA
We should get started studying -
Jeff goes into action, seeing an opening for his crowbar.
JEFF
You know, I’ve been part of a lot
of study groups that fell apart
because of unaddressed tension.
Shouldn’t someone address Annie’s
concern? Did we not invite her?
17.
SHIRLEY
Well, Annie, sweetie, I guess it
didn’t occur to anyone -
ANNIE
- That’s strange, because I
remember the first day of class, I
asked if anyone was interested in
starting a Spanish study group, and
passed around a sign-up sheet, and
when it came back, all that was on
it was a drawing of a unicorn with
a wiener instead of a horn, a
guitar for a wiener and a dog
emerging from its rear.
BRITTA
That was a cat and he was going in.
(off her look)
What? Everyone added something.
ANNIE
Yes, and then gathered behind my
back for a study group!
SHIRLEY
Pumpkin, it’s not behind your back,
we just didn’t think about you.
ANNIE
Can we stop with the pumpkins and
the sweeties? Being younger
doesn’t make me inferior, if
anything, your age indicates you’ve
made bad life decisions.
SHIRLEY
(simmering)
Mmmmmmmm.
JEFF
(seizing opportunity)
Shirley has a response to that.
SHIRLEY
No, I don’t.
The entire room encourages her to respond.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Well, I’m sure I’ve made bad life
decisions.
18.
(MORE)
I decided to spend twenty years
raising children and cleaning up
after a man who ran out the door
ten minutes after winning one-ohtwo-point-seven
thousand dollars in
a radio contest. That was a bad
decision. And maybe Annie’s
decisions will be better. And I
think she should decide whether she
wants to be considered a child or
an adult, because a child gets
pity, but not respect, and adults
can get respect but they can also
get grabbed by the hair and have
their faces put through jukeboxes.
BRITTA
(blurting)
Seriously!
Britta quickly composes herself. Annie pouts. Shirley
regains her shyness. Pierce gives her head a supportive
stroke, causing her to wince. Jeff points a pen at Pierce,
shifting to what he hopes is even more fertile ground for
sowing discontent.
JEFF
Pierce, let’s discuss this
creepiness.
PIERCE
I beg your pardon?
JEFF
Are you unaware Shirley finds your
advances inappropriate?
PIERCE
What advances?
SHIRLEY
You have been sexually harassing me
since the first day of class!
PIERCE
“Sexually harassing?” That doesn’t
make sense, why would I “harass”
someone that turns me on?
TROY
Saying she turns you on is the
harrassment, buddy.
Pierce slams the table with his fist.
19.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
PIERCE
I am a business leader and a
community pillar and I don’t take
courting advice from teenage boys!
TROY
Well this teenage boy is a
quarterback and a prom king, so
maybe you should!
ANNIE
You’re not prom king anymore, Troy,
this isn’t Greendale High.
TROY
How did you know I went there?
ANNIE
Because you’re wearing your stupid
letter jacket and more importantly
I SAT BEHIND YOU IN ALGEBRA!
TROY
Wait, are you the girl that got
hooked on pills and dropped out?
You’re Little Annie Adderall!
ANNIE
And you’re a stupid jock that lost
his scholarship because he
celebrated getting it with a keg
stand and dislocated both
shoulders!
ABED
I’m ready! I’m ready!
Everyone looks at Abed.
ABED (CONT’D)
I bought one of those big binders
to store my DVDs in. And I left it
in the sun, and the plastic sleeves
melted to the discs, and they’re
all unplayable and it’s my fault!
Abed starts sobbing real tears. Everyone watches, confused.
JEFF
That’s your Breakfast Club doozy?
ABED
(through sobs)
I love cinema!
20.
Jeff’s phone rings. He answers.
JEFF
Hello?
A very low voice from the other end:
DUNCAN (V.O.)
(on phone)
It’s Professor Duncan. Come to the
parking lot. Now.
JEFF
What’s wrong with your voice?
DUNCAN (V.O.)
(on phone)
I’m disguising it.
JEFF
I’ll be right there.
Jeff hangs up.
BRITTA
Now where are you going?
JEFF
It’s an emergency. You guys need
to hash this stuff out anyway,
because we can’t study with all
this stuff seething under the
surface. I just hope at least one
of you is here when I get back.
CUT TO:
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Jeff enters the parking lot, looking around.
DUNCAN (O.S.)
Hello, Jeff.
Duncan emerges from between two cars, holding a large, thick
envelope.
DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Every answer to every test in your
curriculum this semester.
JEFF
You are the best.
21.
Jeff reaches for the package. Duncan withholds it.
DUNCAN
But what do I get?
JEFF
I thought we had a deal.
DUNCAN
Deals are bound by ethics, Jeff.
Deals are for five year old girls.
JEFF
What do you want.
DUNCAN
Your Lexus.
JEFF
HA! My luxury sedan for a
semester’s worth of answers?
DUNCAN
Come on, you’re never going to stop
taking the easy way out. I’ll be
helping you for four years. You
want to get a degree while taking
naps? I want leather seats with
built-in ball warmers. Offer
expires in ten seconds.
JEFF
I’m supposed to do what, walk home?
DUNCAN
Take my Prius.
Duncan holds up some keys.
JEFF
PRIUS?
DUNCAN
It’s good for the Earth.
JEFF
So is wiping your butt with a leaf
but it’s not how a man gets around!
DUNCAN
Time’s up.
Duncan starts to walk away. Jeff panics.
22.
JEFF
Alright!
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY
Jeff heads across the library toward the study room, carrying
Duncan’s packet.
Britta opens the door and comes running to him. We can hear
chaos coming from the room behind her.
BRITTA
It’s really bad in there.
JEFF
Yeah, sounds like a train wreck.
What do you say? Time to go?
BRITTA
Go? Jeff, I would rather flunk
Spanish and starve to death than
abandon a group of people in pain.
Jeff stares at her for a beat, then:
JEFF
You thought I meant time to go to
dinner? I meant time to go give
these people the healing they need.
Time to spread the love, time to
set everything back to exactly the
way it was before they got here.
She gives his arm one of those platonic but lingering touches
that women have been using to secretly control civilization
for 50,000 years. As she heads back to the room, Jeff adds
carefully:
JEFF (CONT’D)
Then dinner.
FADE OUT.
23.
ACT III
FADE IN:
INT. STUDY ROOM
Jeff walks in. Everyone is sitting with their arms folded,
staring at the table in front of them.
JEFF
How’s it going in here?
Everyone explodes into furious name calling and arguing.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Alright, alright. Simmer down! I
want to tell you something!
They quiet down. He squares himself. Closing argument time.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You know what makes humans
different from other animals? We
are the only species on Earth that
observes Shark Week. Sharks don’t
even have Shark Week, but we do.
For the same reason I can pick up
this pencil, tell you its name is
Steve, then go like this
(snaps pencil)
And part of you dies just a little
inside. Because humans can connect
to anything. We can sympathize
with a pencil, we can forgive a
shark, we can give Ben Affleck an
Academy Award for screenwriting.
Everyone nods knowingly, touched. Britta, however, remains
poker-faced.
JEFF (CONT’D)
People can find the good in just
about anything but themselves.
Look at me. It’s obvious to all of
you that I’m awesome, and yet, if I
agreed with you, I would be an ass.
But I can think Annie’s awesome in
ways that I’m not. She’s driven.
Some people have to be driven or
the power goes off and the ice
cream melts. And look at Pierce.
24.
(MORE)
Other guys his age are locked up in
their houses yelling at the people
on TV for farting, this guy is out
here, with us, even though he’s
earned the right to dismiss us.
Just like Shirley’s earned a little
elbow room, and a lot of respect,
not as a wife, not as a mother,
it’s time for her to be a woman,
and don’t test her on that, because
that thing about the jukebox was
way too specific to be improvised,
we want her on our side when we
rumble with the other study groups.
The group murmurs in enthusiastic agreement. Troy nods at
Shirley. Shirley smiles.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You want Troy, too. That’s why
we’re tempted to dis the jacket,
because it’s a symbol that
intimidates us, you think
astronauts go to the moon because
they hate oxygen, come on, they’re
trying to impress their high
school’s prom king, and well they
should, because I saw our track
team tonight and I’m pretty sure
Troy’s gonna be a big dog on
campus. And Abed. You know, God
made people with minds that wander
because the answers we need are
barely ever the ones we’re asking.
Abed’s a shaman, ask him to pass
the salt, you get a bowl of soup,
and guess what, soup is better.
Abed is better.
(beat)
You’re all better than you think
you are. You’re just not designed
to believe it when you hear it from
yourself. So everybody, do me a
favor, look to the person on the
left.
Everybody does it.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I want you to extend to that person
the same compassion you extend to
sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck. I
want you to say to that person, “I
forgive you.” Go ahead.
25.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Everyone says “I forgive you.”
JEFF (CONT’D)
Now look at me.
Everyone looks at Jeff.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You just stopped being a study
group. You have now become
something unstoppable. I hereby
pronounce you a community.
Abed wipes at some tears.
ABED
It’s not like Breakfast Club
anymore. Now it’s like Stripes, or
Meatballs. Anything with Bill
Murray, really.
JEFF
I agree with Abed that tonight has
been very special. Too special for
Spanish, really, and I think that,
like the Breakfast Club, we ought
to disband and reflect.
Jeff looks at Britta and nods his head slightly toward the
door, like, “let’s go.”
Britta looks at Jeff. She looks around the room at all the
mesmerized faces. Finally, she announces her decision while
watching Jeff carefully.
BRITTA
Actually, now that we’re
unstoppable, it’ll probably take no
time at all to prepare for this
quiz, right?
Everyone agrees with that. They’re very excited about
studying, now. Jeff goes to plan C.
JEFF
I have a surprise for you guys. We
don’t need to study. I have all
the tests and answers for the
semester.
Jeff shows the packet he got from Duncan.
JEFF (CONT’D)
So. All done.
26.
Everyone at the table is a bit taken aback. Britta narrows
her eyes on him. Pierce puzzles through this.
PIERCE
Well, Jeff, now, why in Hell’s
Bells would you want to enroll in a
community college to cheat?
JEFF
I didn’t want to enroll here,
Pierce, I have to be here. I’m a
lawyer. I mean, I was a lawyer,
and I’d like to get back to being
one as soon as possible.
BRITTA
(gross)
A lawyer...
TROY
Then why have a study group?
JEFF
I DON’T HAVE A STUDY GROUP! YOU
PEOPLE JUST SHOWED UP!
Britta explains something to everyone she’d been putting
together for a while.
BRITTA
It was all to get in my pants.
JEFF
Why can’t you see that for the
compliment that it is?
ANNIE
What about the look left speech?
Was that real?
JEFF
I learned it at tennis camp when I
was seven.
Everyone is dismayed and disappointed.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I added the Ben Affleck references!
BRITTA
Jeff, you had me at “I’m a lawyer,”
and by had me, I mean had me ready
to puke. Now please leave and let
us study before my gag reflex hits
a tipping point.
27.
JEFF
But you’re not listening, I have
the answers.
Britta physically gags.
Abed shakes his head.
ABED
I thought you were like Bill Murray
in any of his films. But you’re
really like Michael Douglas in any
of his.
JEFF
Yeah, well, you have Asperger’s.
As Jeff exits, everyone recoils in shock and comforts a
confused Abed.
BRITTA
He is not qualified to make that
diagnosis.
CUT TO:
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Jeff exits the front doors, miffed, sour grapey, opening
Duncan’s packet.
He gets the envelope open and pulls out a stack of papers
from inside. He looks at them, stunned.
We watch as Jeff flips through a stack of pages from old
Psychology Today magazines.
CUT TO:
INT. DUNCAN’S OFFICE
Professor Duncan is enjoying a pipe in his office and seems
to have been expecting Jeff to burst through the door, which
Jeff now does.
DUNCAN
Before you react, you’ll want to
think about the gift you’ve been
given.
JEFF
An excuse to punch a hippy?
28.
DUNCAN
A second chance at an honest life.
A life that starts here at
Greendale. All these tricks you
acquired to survive out there, they
have no use in this place that
you’re wiping your feet on. People
here are excited and proud to be
here, students and faculty alike.
And frankly, we’re a little
offended by the implication that
there’s anywhere else we’d like to
be. This is a lesson you need to
learn, Jeff.
Jeff shrugs.
JEFF
Well, I’m...I’m sorry, but I’m not
getting it.
DUNCAN
Maybe you’re incapable of learning.
JEFF
Is it possible you’re incapable of
teaching? It is community college.
Now give me my keys or it’s going
to get sloppy.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
Jeff stomps across the empty night time campus of Greendale
community college. So fucked.
He sees the Old Black Woman sitting on one of the benches
that is just outside the library entrance. He starts walking
to her. She’s clearly bummed out about this. He stands by
her for a moment, mustering the confession:
JEFF
I don’t know how to do it.
OLD BLACK WOMAN
I don’t care.
She gets up.
JEFF
Where are you going?
OLD BLACK WOMAN
(sarcastic)
Don’t you know, honey child?
29.
(MORE)
I gots to go polish that moon and
hang them clouds out to dry. But
don’t you worry. Outer space Jesus
negro lady is watching over you.
Jeff slumps down on the bench as she walks away.
JEFF
Great. Even God thinks I’m a dick.
He sits there for a moment. Puts his head back.
Pierce emerges from the library’s front doors, sees Jeff, and
pauses to take in the night air.
PIERCE
Boy. There is Autumn, and then
there is just Fall.
JEFF
You may have purchased a knockoff
calendar.
PIERCE
You said some nice things about me
up there, Jeffrey.
Pierce sits on another bench across from him.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
And I do admit, I’ve got things to
learn about the ladies. You know
I’ve been married seven times? I’m
starting to think I’m doing
something wrong.
JEFF
Do I look like I’m in a position to
give romantic advice right now?
Troy comes out of the library, sees them both and nods.
TROY
Hey.
JEFF
I thought you guys were studying.
TROY
We’re done.
JEFF
Oh. That was fast.
Troy sits next to him, curious.
30.
OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
TROY
Let me ask you something. People
have been clowning me about this
jacket since I got here. But if I
take it off to make them happy, I’m
weak, right?
JEFF
(shrug)
Troy, what’s it matter. You lose
the jacket to please them, you keep
it to piss them off...either way,
it’s for them, that’s what’s weak.
TROY
(epiphany)
Whoa.
(bigger epiphany)
Whoa.
(confusion)
Wait, but -
(realization)
Whoa!
PIERCE
He’s good, isn’t he?
TROY
My brain’s all wrinkly.
Jeff doesn’t necessarily mind the praise, but he’s still got
wallowing to do.
Shirley and Annie come through the doors together. Annie
stops when she sees the boys sitting together.
ANNIE
Is this another “we hate Annie”
meeting?
SHIRLEY
Oh, sweetie. Nobody hates you.
(catching it)
Sorry I called you sweetie, it’s a
mother’s habit -
ANNIE
- It’s not that bad, really.
(almost crying)
My parents, um -
(clears throat)
This is interesting architecture.
Abed and Britta come through the library doors.
31.
ABED
Oh, hey, everybody.
Britta is not excited to see Jeff.
BRITTA
Shouldn’t you be at home rolling
around on a bed covered with quiz
answers?
Jeff tosses the envelope to her. She looks at the contents.
BRITTA (CONT’D)
Ha! Live by the sword, huh Amigo?
(explaining)
Amigo means “friend.” You might
need to know that for tomorrow.
Jeff nods, resigned to his fate.
JEFF
I want to say something.
Jeff starts to say something. Then stops. He gets a weird
look on his face.
JEFF (CONT’D)
But nothing I say is true, so...I
can’t...
He struggles. Then, finally:
JEFF (CONT’D)
Sorry. I need help.
He buries his face in his hands.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I’m gonna flunk. I need help.
The group looks around at each other. Mostly, they’re all
looking at Britta.
Shirley looks at Britta with a face that says “do something.”
Britta looks at Shirley with a “What? Me?” face. She
indicates Jeff and makes a gagging gesture.
Shirley makes a gesture that means “give me a break and maybe
also get over yourself because there are worse things in the
world than men making asses of themselves over you.”
Troy gestures insistently. So does Pierce. Abed is
confused.
32.
ABED
What’s going on? Can you guys hear
me? Am I deaf?
Jeff looks up, curious to see what Abed is talking about.
Britta makes a decision. She addresses the group.
BRITTA
Hey, um. We should, um.
(clears throat)
We should get back upstairs, and
finish, right?
Jeff is confused.
JEFF
I thought you were done.
BRITTA
Who said that? Are we done?
PIERCE
I’m not done.
Everyone agrees they’re not done. Abed is more confused.
BRITTA
Well, let’s go. Jeff, you coming?
Jeff is taken aback by the offer.
JEFF
Are you serious? I can study with
you guys?
BRITTA
Eh. You know. If you want. I
don’t care.
Jeff stands up, recovering from his depression.
JEFF
That’s the nicest thing anyone’s
ever said to me.
The group heads back for the library entrance as we pull back
in a crane shot that, like this campus, packs a lot of
emotional punch for a reasonable price.
FADE OUT.

SR. CHANG is at the white board, finishing up a Spanish *
lesson. *
SR. CHANG
...hablamos hablar. Okay, before *
we wrap up, I’d like to thank you *
for filling out your anonymous *
evaluation cards. I found your *
suggestions to be largely *
constructive and flattering. But *
there was one of you whose *
evaluation was so harsh, I took the *
time to analyze the person’s *
handwriting against past exams. *
(leaning into Annie) *
And I noticed that this coward dots *
her I’s with hearts. Who’s *
“erratic and unstable” now, *
princess gringo?! *
(then, sweet) *
Okay, see you tomorrow. *
Everyone in our STUDY GROUP exits the classroom with the rest *
of the students.
2 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 2
JEFF and SHIRLEY walk in the same direction down the hall.
SHIRLEY
Nice day out today, isn’t it?
JEFF
(like he forgot something)
Yeah. Oh. Damn.
Jeff starts back towards the classroom as Shirley walks off.
He runs into BRITTA.
BRITTA
Forget something?
JEFF
Yeah, I forgot to stagger the
timing of my exit with Shirley’s.
(MORE)
We both have an eleven o’clock all *

Jeff and Britta walk together, out of the school building and
onto the quad. *
BRITTA
I find Shirley very easy to talk
to. And aren’t you supposed to
have, like, an olympic gold medal
in jibber jabber?
JEFF
Yeah, but I’m a sprinter, I’m at my
best during high speed bursts of
wit. You lock me into Shirley’s
stride for a marathon banter about
her brownies? The awkward silence
is going to set in before we pass
the stoner tree.
We see a tree where stoners are hanging out. VAUGHN, a hot,
laid-back guy, plays hackey sack with no socks on and his *
shirt in his back pocket.
VAUGHN
Hey, Britta. Hi. ‘Sup?
BRITTA
Hey, Vaughn. How’s it going?
VAUGHN
No worries.
JEFF
(to Britta)
Interesting. Cause I might worry
if I played hackey sack a decade *
too late.
BRITTA
My class is this way. *
JEFF *
Alright, but I just wanted to point *
out that we easily walked more than *
a hundred yards without a single *
awkward pause, and that’s the mark *
of a true friend. So, nice walking *
with you, friend. *

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
3 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 3
ANNIE runs up to PROFESSOR DUNCAN who is in line to pay.
ANNIE
Professor Duncan. Annie Edison, *
I’m in your 101 lecture, I’ve heard *
about your special psych lab -- *
PROF. DUNCAN *
Ah. The Duncan Principle.
ANNIE *
Yes, and I know it’s limited to *
second year students, but I had a *
4.0 at Riverside High, and I’m not *
looking down on this school at all, *
but I’m only here because of a *
brief addiction to pills that I was *
told would help me focus but they *
actually made me lose my *
scholarship and virginity. If I *
could take your lab early, it would *
be a real feather in my transcript. *
PROF. DUNCAN
I’ve been in this situation many
times, so I’m going to be up front.
I’m not allowed to date students. *
Even though you are an eight, a *

you’re still interested, you may
join the lab.
Annie jumps.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
You need to bring two human
subjects. It also wouldn’t hurt *
your chances if you could lend me a
fiver.
(while she gets one)
I seem to have left my purse in my
duffle, and my duffle in the boot
of my lorry.
Annie hands him five dollars.

Jeff, ABED, PIERCE, Shirley, and TROY at a table near the
coffee stand. Jeff looks on as Britta stands in the coffee
line talking with Vaughn. Pierce makes a meal out of opening
his express package.
PIERCE
What could this express package be?
Someone needed to get me something fast.
SHIRLEY
You brought your mail to campus?
PIERCE
Didn’t have time to open it at home.
JEFF
Plus, if you opened it at home, we
wouldn’t be able to see whatever it
is you want us to see.
PIERCE
(opening package)
Oh, yes. My Ear-Noculars.
JEFF
Perfect.
TROY
What is that? It looks like your
Bluetooth thingie.
Pierce turns his head. He has a Bluetooth headset in one ear.
PIERCE
No no no. This is my cell phone
headset. This is Ear-Noculars.
It’s for spies and what have you.
It gives you sonic hearing.
ABED
All hearing is sonic.
PIERCE
(not hearing)
What’s that?
JEFF
You might want to take that ear
thing for a spin.
Pierce looks through the Ear-Noculars literature.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 4.
PIERCE
This is great. I’ll be able to
hear a violin from the balcony or
the doorbell ring when I’m out
gardening.
JEFF
So, it’s a hearing aid.
PIERCE
(snapping)
No!
(composes himself)
A hearing aid is for people who
can’t hear. Ear-Noculars are for
people who can’t hear enough.
TROY
(reading box)
Eyes for your ears. That’s freaky.
Annie approaches.
ANNIE
So who wants to be in a psych
experiment?
Pierce has his Ear-Noculars on, unaware of Annie.
PIERCE
Guys, guys,...
(conspiratorial)
Annie’s talking... about some kind
of experiment.
JEFF
She’s behind you.
(to Annie)
Not interested.
ANNIE
Come on, this is huge for me. I’d
be the first Freshman to sit in on
Professor Duncan’s experiment.
JEFF
Is it the one where he proves that
if you drink enough scotch, you
forget you’re not driving in
England?

ANNIE
No, Jeff. It’s supposed to be mindblowing.
Pleeeease? You get paid.
TROY
Do they do stuff to your butt?
ANNIE
Uh... No.
TROY
Well, I’ll do it anyway.
Everyone but Annie looks at Troy, who minds his lunch,
oblivious.

ANNIE
Yay! How about you, Abed? It’s
tomorrow.
ABED
Oof. Tomorrow? They’re showing
all four Indiana Jones’s at The
Vista. I was really looking
forward to the first three. I
bought a whip.
She stops walking and turns to face him, with puppy dog eyes.
ANNIE
This is really important to me,
Abed. Could you please go as my
friend. My really good friend?
ABED
Wow, I didn’t realize we were really
good friends. I figured we were more
like Chandler and Phoebe. They
never really had stories together.
Sure, I’ll do it, Chandler.
ANNIE
(hugging Abed)
Oh, thank you, Abed.
SHIRLEY
That’s nice.
Off Shirley’s “that’s nice,” Jeff looks for Britta and
notices she’s still talking with Vaughn.
JEFF
(getting up)
I better save Britta from that
dude.
SHIRLEY
Yeah, she looks like she’s in
trouble. I hope he doesn’t
“handsome” her to death.
Shirley watches Jeff approach Britta and Vaughn.
JEFF
Hey.
VAUGHN
Hi, what’s up, hey. I’m Vaughn.
Man, those shoes look comfortable.

JEFF
Thanks. You in line?
VAUGHN
Nah, just chillin. Hey, you’re not
gonna order a coffee are you?
JEFF
No, I was just seeing if Britta...
VAUGHN
Hey, no judgement at all, brah. I
used to do coffee, but then I
switched to green tea and it’s like
filled with antioxidants and stuff.
It’s pretty tight.
JEFF
(to Britta)
Tight, yes. I’ve heard that about
green tea.
Britta doesn’t look at Jeff. She smiles at Vaughn.
BRITTA
I like green tea. I should make
the change.
Back at the table, Pierce observes Britta and speaks
studiously while touching his bionic ear.
PIERCE
Britta’s making the change to green
tea.

Prof. Duncan (now wearing a lab coat) addresses several psych

PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
If you turn your attention to the

are waiting for the experiment to
begin, but... it’s actually
happening right now.
The students GASP, they are into it.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
You’re welcome.

Prof. Duncan winks. Annie titters excitedly.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
The waiting is the experiment. The *
Duncan Principle is simple: The
more control lost by - actually, I *
should take this down, too. *
(takes his own notes) *
The more control lost by the ego, *
the more gained by the id,
resulting in a surprisingly
predictable emotional eruption or *
breaking point, *
(southern accent) *
known to ma and pa as a “tantrum.” *
(waits for chuckle, gets
it)
Annie, please let our subjects know *
that the experiment will start in
five minutes.
A smiling Annie crosses to the door.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
(whispering to everyone)
But it’s never going to start. *
Educated titters. Annie waves her hand over her face, going
from a smile to a serious face. She opens the door into the
waiting room.

ANNIE
Hi, everyone. Hi, Troy. Hi, Abed. *
Oh, hi, Sr. Chang. *
Sr. Chang is seated in the room as well. *
SR. CHANG *

could use the eighty bucks?
ANNIE
Okay. Well, we are running just a *

And we’re off. *
The students murmur in fascination. *
7 EXT. QUAD - LATER 7
Jeff exits the school building with Shirley and some other
students. He bends down to tie his shoe, hoping Shirley will
keep walking. When he stands, she is right there.
SHIRLEY
Did you know we walk the same way
after class? I’m sure you didn’t
or else we would’ve been walking
together, unless you’re a jerk,
just kidding.
JEFF
Ha. Let’s do it.
Jeff starts walking with her.
SHIRLEY
Oh hold on now, going a little too
fast for these dogs.
The walk is even slower. Long, awkward silence. They both *
try to break it.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You have a kid, right?
SHIRLEY
How do you like Greendale?
SHIRLEY (CONT’D) *
What’s that?
JEFF
Nothing.
Shirley exhales. This is painful for her too. Long silence. *

JEFF *
Oh, I don’t know, he seems like a *
pretty normal guy, oh wait, he’s *
NUTS. *
Shirley giggles. *
SHIRLEY
You better be careful, he might be
listening with his Inspector Gadget
hearing aid. You know that show? *
JEFF *
I do know that show. *
SHIRLEY *
Oh, and how about that Hackey Sack
guy? Always around, flirting with
Britta. It’s embarrassing.
JEFF *
(too loud)
I know! He’s the worst! *
SHIRLEY *
I mean, what is with that hair?
JEFF
It’s perpetually moist. And the
incessant evangelizing of green
tea. No offense, but if I want
medical advice, I’ll get it from
someone wearing socks.
Shirley loves that one. They continue gabbing. *
8 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM - LATER 8
Prof. Duncan stands in front of the monitor. He checks his
watch.
PROF. DUNCAN
Okay, we’re three hours in, let’s
review what we’ve seen. Pay close
attention to every subject’s
breaking point. *
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 10.

ANGLE ON the monitor: Prof. Duncan fast forwards the tape.
We start with a room full of subjects. Over time, we see
Annie pop in and out of the room. One after another,
frustrated subjects get up and leave. (The research
assistants take notes.)
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
(commenting on what he
sees)
Look at this one. He’s a
stomper... This one’s a screamer...
We got a bulemic... Look at the
little one chase the big one, it’s
like Benny Hill... Fore!... Ooh,
he just hit that girl...
On the tape, all that remain now are Abed and Troy. Abed
remains motionless while Troy slowly melts down and exits. *
Abed is the only one left. He sits patiently, hands folded
in his lap. Prof. Duncan leans closer to the screen.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Ah, I’ve seen this before. The
longer they wait, the harder they
break. Buckle up, students.
(then, noticing)
Does he have a whip?
9 EXT. QUAD - LATER 9
Shirley and Jeff sit on the bench, laughing.
SHIRLEY
Oh, and have you seen how often
Hackey Sack takes his shirt off? *
He’d play shirts and skins in a
game of checkers. *

JEFF *
I am so glad to be able to talk
about that guy. I wanted to say
something to Britta but we’re *
supposed to be friends now and *
she’d think I was jealous. *
SHIRLEY *
I don’t see why you and Britta
aren’t together. Two cute white
people, going to school together,
just seems right.
JEFF
Shirley, we’re not pandas in a zoo.
SHIRLEY
(seeing something)
Oh dear.
Jeff looks. Britta and Vaughn make out on the quad.
JEFF
That is not what I want to see.
Britta looks up, sees Jeff watching her.
SHIRLEY
And there goes the shirt.
FADE OUT.

Oh, whatever. Seize the day, man, *
life is short. Get up on that. *
You know? All aboard the *
dreamboat. *
BRITTA
I wasn’t sure when or how to bring *
up that I was hanging out with
Vaughn. Figured you’d... make fun
of him. And me.
JEFF
First of all, friends don’t make
fun of each other, and secondly,

Vaughn seems cool. *
Britta is impressed with Jeff. *
BRITTA *
You guys should hang out. Well, *
I gotta go. That was tacky out *

11 EXT. QUAD - NEXT MORNING (DAY 3) 11
Pierce talks to Shirley as they exit the school building from
before. He wears his Ear-Noculars and Bluetooth.
PIERCE
This thing is amazing. I could
finally hear Mr. Chang from the
back of the room. Too bad they
don’t make one of these for
accents. What’s that? What do you *
mean you got a hold of some “sweet *
weed”? *
SHIRLEY
Doesn’t it get confusing with the *
phone in one ear and that thing in *
the other? *
PIERCE
It’s called living in the modern *
world. *
His cell phone RINGS in his other ear. It’s very loud for *
Pierce and startles him.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
Hello. Mom? Yes, I’ll visit soon. *
What do you mean, “Do I want a *
toke?” Wait. Who’s about to bust *
you? What pigs? What pigs are *
coming? Just put Dad on. *
As Pierce walks off contorting in confusion, Jeff hurries up *
to Shirley.
JEFF
Shirley! Did you notice Sr.
Chang’s socks today? Tiny bull
fighters.
SHIRLEY
I can top that. Did you see Hacky
Sack wears an anklet?
Jeff doesn’t react. *
SHIRLEY (CONT’D) *
Since when won’t you talk about *
Vaughn? No fun. *

unpredictable. I’m going to show *
her I’m not the jerk she thinks I *
am and friend the hell out of that *

The room is a complete mess, littered with take-out food
containers, crumpled pieces of paper and empty coffee cups.
Prof. Duncan, Annie and the other research assistants are
bleary eyed, but they continue to watch the monitor. On the
monitor, Abed happily sits in the same position.

No, that’s just him.
Annie opens the door to the waiting room.

Prof. Duncan starts yelling and stomping his feet in complete
exasperation. The other research assistants take notes on
his behavior. He notices.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
What are you doing?! Stop writing!
He grabs one of their composition notebooks and throws it at *
them. Terrified, the assistants scramble to the door. *

Well that’s a cool shirt.
VAUGHN
Thanks.
Jeff looks at Shirley like “what are you up to?”

He takes his shirt off. Shirley, behind Vaughn’s back,
smiles big at Jeff.
VAUGHN (CONT’D)
Hanes. Classic.
SHIRLEY
That’s nice.
Vaughn turns back to Jeff, still with his shirt off. While
Vaughn talks to Jeff about volunteering, Shirley motions for
Jeff to check out the nipples. So small. Where are they?
Jeff tries not to laugh.
VAUGHN
You know, people underestimate the
elderly, but you should see these

So, what’s your plan? Pairing off

ABED

Yes. I was livid.
ANNIE
Then why didn’t you leave?!

That’s really beautiful.

Wait. Is this still part of the

Jeff and Shirley enter, giggling and gabbing.

Shirley does a Vaughn face. Jeff laughs. Pierce opens the
door to the study room and strides in.

Who is this guy?
SHIRLEY
Oh, you all have to see him.
Everything’s, “no worries, no

17 EXT. QUAD - LATER 17
An angry Jeff walks across the quad. Shirley catches up with
him.
SHIRLEY
Jeff, wait! I’m sorry I sold you
out.
JEFF
Britta’s never going to forgive me. *
I can’t believe I showed you that
poem - good lord, when did my life *
become an episode of Degrassi High? *
SHIRLEY *
(indicates nearby bench) *
Can we talk?
Jeff sighs and sits with Shirley.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Jeff. I have a gossip problem.
JEFF
I’m not a real supporter of this
word but... duh.
SHIRLEY
I stir the pot, Jeff. I’m a pot *
stirrer. This isn’t the only study
group I’ve had this year. See
those ladies over there?
ANGLE ON a group of African American women hanging out
together. One of them gives Shirley a dirty look.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
I was in that group until they
kicked me out. They call me
“Tattle-ina.”
(then)
It’s a bumblebee nickname. It’s
cute but it stings.
Jeff looks over at Shirley’s former study group.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 26.
JEFF
Look how big that woman’s earrings
are. It’s like little dogs should
be jumping through ‘em.
Shirley puts her fist to her mouth, using every bit of
strength not to gossip.
SHIRLEY
(high pitched)
Mmmmmmmm.
(determined; re: Jeff and
her)
This is never going to work. It’s *
got to end.
JEFF
Shirley. Don’t do this. We can *
still hang out. We just won’t bag
on people.
SHIRLEY
(laughs)
Come on, Jeff. What are we gonna
talk about? My kids? Your old
doctor career?
JEFF
I was a lawyer.
SHIRLEY
See? I’m already bored.
JEFF
Well, we’ll always have “tiny nipples.”
Shirley smiles. Jeff starts off.
SHIRLEY
Jeff! Wait!
Jeff stops and turns.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
I know I shouldn’t, but just one
last gossip. Britta told me she
had a sex dream about you. You
still have a chance.
JEFF *
Details. *

Annie approaches Abed who eats at a table. She holds a gift.
ANNIE
Abed, here. I wanted to say sorry
for yelling at you. You were being
a good friend and I was really
selfish.
He looks in the gift bag.
ABED
Indiana Jones, cool.
ANNIE
I just got you the first three
because...
ABED
(touched)
The fourth one blows.
They share a smile.
ABED (CONT’D)
We’re cool.
Professor Duncan approaches.
DUNCAN
Oh Annie, there you are. You know, *
after I went home and drank and *
slept and drank some more, I
realized it was I who had reached a *
breaking point. I had been the *
subject of my own study. And I
LOVED it. Not only was the Duncan *
Principle upheld, I now have even *
more reason to study it. We’re *
running some new trials tonight if *
you’d like to assist. *
Annie looks at Abed then at the Professor. *
ANNIE *
Actually, Professor, I think I’m *
watching movies tonight, with a *
friend.
Annie and Abed walk away. Duncan is at a loss. *
Jeff walks by, towards Britta in the student lounge. *
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 28.
BRITTA
Don’t want to talk to you. *
JEFF *
I know, I’m sorry. Really, really *
sorry. And I can go talk to Vaughn *
if you want me -- *
BRITTA *
Vaughn broke up with me. *
JEFF *
(happy) *
Oh. *
(sympathetic) *
Oh. *
BRITTA *
You broke my trust. You suck. *
JEFF *
I’m sorry. I was in a tough *
position, I needed to vent, so I *
showed Shirley the poem. I *
couldn’t handle being just one of *
the girls. *
BRITTA *
But I liked you as one of the *
girls. What do you want to be? *
JEFF *
I don’t know, is there a spot on *
the friendship spectrum between *
total stranger and having to hear *
about the guys you date? Ideally, *
one notch underneath driving you to *
the airport and painting your *
kitchen? *
BRITTA *
I think we can work something out. *
JEFF *
Great. *

your dreams, I won’t complain.
BRITTA
Shirley.
JEFF
She has a real problem. She stirs *
the pot. She’s a pot stirrer. *
19 EXT. QUAD - DAY 19
A down Vaughn approaches the stoner tree. His STONER FRIEND *
kicks him the hackey sack. Vaughn misses it. *
VAUGHN *
Sorry ‘bout that. *
STONER FRIEND *
Hey, no worries. *
Vaughn looks his friends in the eyes, and gives them this *
warning... *
VAUGHN *
Some worries. Some worries. *
His friends seem dismayed to hear this is possible. The *
world is changing again. *
20 EXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS 20 *
Jeff walks alone, sad. A student in a weird outfit walks by. *
JEFF *
Shirley would say something funny *
about that. *
Jeff looks up and sees Shirley walking toward him. He *
smiles, but then sees she’s walking with Britta. *
SHIRLEY *
Well you know... *

...Jeff. Shhh. *

Where’s your Ear-thing? *
PIERCE *
Got rid of it. Jeff, there are *
certain things man is not meant to *
hear. We were designed, by *
whatever entity you choose, to hear *
what’s in this range... *
(motions around him) *
And this range alone. Because, you *
know who’s talking to us in this *
range? The people we love. *
Pierce walks away, leaving Jeff to ponder this. *

He heard us call him Inspector *
Gadget. *

1 INT. SPANISH CLASSROOM - MORNING (DAY 1) 1
SR. CHANG is at the white board, finishing up a Spanish *
lesson. *
SR. CHANG
...hablamos hablar. Okay, before *
we wrap up, I’d like to thank you *
for filling out your anonymous *
evaluation cards. I found your *
suggestions to be largely *
constructive and flattering. But *
there was one of you whose *
evaluation was so harsh, I took the *
time to analyze the person’s *
handwriting against past exams. *
(leaning into Annie) *
And I noticed that this coward dots *
her I’s with hearts. Who’s *
“erratic and unstable” now, *
princess gringo?! *
(then, sweet) *
Okay, see you tomorrow. *
Everyone in our STUDY GROUP exits the classroom with the rest *
of the students.
2 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 2
JEFF and SHIRLEY walk in the same direction down the hall.
SHIRLEY
Nice day out today, isn’t it?
JEFF
(like he forgot something)
Yeah. Oh. Damn.
Jeff starts back towards the classroom as Shirley walks off.
He runs into BRITTA.
BRITTA
Forget something?
JEFF
Yeah, I forgot to stagger the
timing of my exit with Shirley’s.
(MORE)
We both have an eleven o’clock all *
the way across campus and I can’t
go that kind of distance with “Ooh,
that’s nice.”
BRITTA
That’s mean.
JEFF
No...
(doing Shirley)
That’s not nice.

A3 EXT. QUAD - SECONDS LATER A3
Jeff and Britta walk together, out of the school building and
onto the quad. *
BRITTA
I find Shirley very easy to talk
to. And aren’t you supposed to
have, like, an olympic gold medal
in jibber jabber?
JEFF
Yeah, but I’m a sprinter, I’m at my
best during high speed bursts of
wit. You lock me into Shirley’s
stride for a marathon banter about
her brownies? The awkward silence
is going to set in before we pass
the stoner tree.
We see a tree where stoners are hanging out. VAUGHN, a hot,
laid-back guy, plays hackey sack with no socks on and his *
shirt in his back pocket.
VAUGHN
Hey, Britta. Hi. ‘Sup?
BRITTA
Hey, Vaughn. How’s it going?
VAUGHN
No worries.
JEFF
(to Britta)
Interesting. Cause I might worry
if I played hackey sack a decade *
too late.
BRITTA
My class is this way. *
JEFF *
Alright, but I just wanted to point *
out that we easily walked more than *
a hundred yards without a single *
awkward pause, and that’s the mark *
of a true friend. So, nice walking *
with you, friend. *
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 2.

3 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 3
ANNIE runs up to PROFESSOR DUNCAN who is in line to pay.
ANNIE
Professor Duncan. Annie Edison, *
I’m in your 101 lecture, I’ve heard *
about your special psych lab -- *
PROF. DUNCAN *
Ah. The Duncan Principle.
ANNIE *
Yes, and I know it’s limited to *
second year students, but I had a *
4.0 at Riverside High, and I’m not *
looking down on this school at all, *
but I’m only here because of a *
brief addiction to pills that I was *
told would help me focus but they *
actually made me lose my *
scholarship and virginity. If I *
could take your lab early, it would *
be a real feather in my transcript. *
PROF. DUNCAN
I’ve been in this situation many
times, so I’m going to be up front.
I’m not allowed to date students. *
Even though you are an eight, a *
British ten. If, in spite of that, *
you’re still interested, you may
join the lab.
Annie jumps.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
You need to bring two human
subjects. It also wouldn’t hurt *
your chances if you could lend me a
fiver.
(while she gets one)
I seem to have left my purse in my
duffle, and my duffle in the boot
of my lorry.
Annie hands him five dollars.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 3.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Brilliant. See you tomorrow,
research assistant.
Annie squeals in something akin to ecstasy and hurries off.

A4 INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS A4
Jeff, ABED, PIERCE, Shirley, and TROY at a table near the
coffee stand. Jeff looks on as Britta stands in the coffee
line talking with Vaughn. Pierce makes a meal out of opening
his express package.
PIERCE
What could this express package be?
Someone needed to get me something fast.
SHIRLEY
You brought your mail to campus?
PIERCE
Didn’t have time to open it at home.
JEFF
Plus, if you opened it at home, we
wouldn’t be able to see whatever it
is you want us to see.
PIERCE
(opening package)
Oh, yes. My Ear-Noculars.
JEFF
Perfect.
TROY
What is that? It looks like your
Bluetooth thingie.
Pierce turns his head. He has a Bluetooth headset in one ear.
PIERCE
No no no. This is my cell phone
headset. This is Ear-Noculars.
It’s for spies and what have you.
It gives you sonic hearing.
ABED
All hearing is sonic.
PIERCE
(not hearing)
What’s that?
JEFF
You might want to take that ear
thing for a spin.
Pierce looks through the Ear-Noculars literature.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 4.
PIERCE
This is great. I’ll be able to
hear a violin from the balcony or
the doorbell ring when I’m out
gardening.
JEFF
So, it’s a hearing aid.
PIERCE
(snapping)
No!
(composes himself)
A hearing aid is for people who
can’t hear. Ear-Noculars are for
people who can’t hear enough.
TROY
(reading box)
Eyes for your ears. That’s freaky.
Annie approaches.
ANNIE
So who wants to be in a psych
experiment?
Pierce has his Ear-Noculars on, unaware of Annie.
PIERCE
Guys, guys,...
(conspiratorial)
Annie’s talking... about some kind
of experiment.
JEFF
She’s behind you.
(to Annie)
Not interested.
ANNIE
Come on, this is huge for me. I’d
be the first Freshman to sit in on
Professor Duncan’s experiment.
JEFF
Is it the one where he proves that
if you drink enough scotch, you
forget you’re not driving in
England?
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 5.
A4 CONTINUED: A4
ANNIE
No, Jeff. It’s supposed to be mindblowing.
Pleeeease? You get paid.
TROY
Do they do stuff to your butt?
ANNIE
Uh... No.
TROY
Well, I’ll do it anyway.
Everyone but Annie looks at Troy, who minds his lunch,
oblivious.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 5A.
A4 CONTINUED: A4
ANNIE
Yay! How about you, Abed? It’s
tomorrow.
ABED
Oof. Tomorrow? They’re showing
all four Indiana Jones’s at The
Vista. I was really looking
forward to the first three. I
bought a whip.
She stops walking and turns to face him, with puppy dog eyes.
ANNIE
This is really important to me,
Abed. Could you please go as my
friend. My really good friend?
ABED
Wow, I didn’t realize we were really
good friends. I figured we were more
like Chandler and Phoebe. They
never really had stories together.
Sure, I’ll do it, Chandler.
ANNIE
(hugging Abed)
Oh, thank you, Abed.
SHIRLEY
That’s nice.
Off Shirley’s “that’s nice,” Jeff looks for Britta and
notices she’s still talking with Vaughn.
JEFF
(getting up)
I better save Britta from that
dude.
SHIRLEY
Yeah, she looks like she’s in
trouble. I hope he doesn’t
“handsome” her to death.
Shirley watches Jeff approach Britta and Vaughn.
JEFF
Hey.
VAUGHN
Hi, what’s up, hey. I’m Vaughn.
Man, those shoes look comfortable.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 6.
A4 CONTINUED: A4
JEFF
Thanks. You in line?
VAUGHN
Nah, just chillin. Hey, you’re not
gonna order a coffee are you?
JEFF
No, I was just seeing if Britta...
VAUGHN
Hey, no judgement at all, brah. I
used to do coffee, but then I
switched to green tea and it’s like
filled with antioxidants and stuff.
It’s pretty tight.
JEFF
(to Britta)
Tight, yes. I’ve heard that about
green tea.
Britta doesn’t look at Jeff. She smiles at Vaughn.
BRITTA
I like green tea. I should make
the change.
Back at the table, Pierce observes Britta and speaks
studiously while touching his bionic ear.
PIERCE
Britta’s making the change to green
tea.
4 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM - NEXT MORNING (DAY 2) 4
Prof. Duncan (now wearing a lab coat) addresses several psych
student assistants, including Annie.
PROF. DUNCAN
Welcome, research assistants. *
Annie claps.
ANGLE ON the monitor. From a hidden camera perspective, we
see Abed, Troy, and other students sitting in a waiting room.

PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
If you turn your attention to the
monitor, you will see our subjects
are waiting for the experiment to
begin, but... it’s actually
happening right now.
The students GASP, they are into it.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
You’re welcome.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 7A.
4 CONTINUED: 4
Prof. Duncan winks. Annie titters excitedly.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
The waiting is the experiment. The *
Duncan Principle is simple: The
more control lost by - actually, I *
should take this down, too. *
(takes his own notes) *
The more control lost by the ego, *
the more gained by the id,
resulting in a surprisingly
predictable emotional eruption or *
breaking point, *
(southern accent) *
known to ma and pa as a “tantrum.” *
(waits for chuckle, gets
it)
Annie, please let our subjects know *
that the experiment will start in
five minutes.
A smiling Annie crosses to the door.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
(whispering to everyone)
But it’s never going to start. *
Educated titters. Annie waves her hand over her face, going
from a smile to a serious face. She opens the door into the
waiting room.
5 INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 5
ANNIE
Hi, everyone. Hi, Troy. Hi, Abed. *
Oh, hi, Sr. Chang. *
Sr. Chang is seated in the room as well. *
SR. CHANG *
Yeah, what, you don’t think a *
community college Spanish teacher
could use the eighty bucks?
ANNIE
Okay. Well, we are running just a *
little bit behind, so it’s going to *
be five -- *

Sr. Chang kicks over a chair and storms out.
6 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 6
PROF. DUNCAN
And we’re off. *
The students murmur in fascination. *
7 EXT. QUAD - LATER 7
Jeff exits the school building with Shirley and some other
students. He bends down to tie his shoe, hoping Shirley will
keep walking. When he stands, she is right there.
SHIRLEY
Did you know we walk the same way
after class? I’m sure you didn’t
or else we would’ve been walking
together, unless you’re a jerk,
just kidding.
JEFF
Ha. Let’s do it.
Jeff starts walking with her.
SHIRLEY
Oh hold on now, going a little too
fast for these dogs.
The walk is even slower. Long, awkward silence. They both *
try to break it.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You have a kid, right?
SHIRLEY
How do you like Greendale?
SHIRLEY (CONT’D) *
What’s that?
JEFF
Nothing.
Shirley exhales. This is painful for her too. Long silence. *

SHIRLEY
Pierce is not exactly right in his
head, is he?
Jeff smiles. This perks him up.
JEFF *
Oh, I don’t know, he seems like a *
pretty normal guy, oh wait, he’s *
NUTS. *
Shirley giggles. *
SHIRLEY
You better be careful, he might be
listening with his Inspector Gadget
hearing aid. You know that show? *
JEFF *
I do know that show. *
SHIRLEY *
Oh, and how about that Hackey Sack
guy? Always around, flirting with
Britta. It’s embarrassing.
JEFF *
(too loud)
I know! He’s the worst! *
SHIRLEY *
I mean, what is with that hair?
JEFF
It’s perpetually moist. And the
incessant evangelizing of green
tea. No offense, but if I want
medical advice, I’ll get it from
someone wearing socks.
Shirley loves that one. They continue gabbing. *
8 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM - LATER 8
Prof. Duncan stands in front of the monitor. He checks his
watch.
PROF. DUNCAN
Okay, we’re three hours in, let’s
review what we’ve seen. Pay close
attention to every subject’s
breaking point. *
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 10.
7 CONTINUED: 7
ANGLE ON the monitor: Prof. Duncan fast forwards the tape.
We start with a room full of subjects. Over time, we see
Annie pop in and out of the room. One after another,
frustrated subjects get up and leave. (The research
assistants take notes.)
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
(commenting on what he
sees)
Look at this one. He’s a
stomper... This one’s a screamer...
We got a bulemic... Look at the
little one chase the big one, it’s
like Benny Hill... Fore!... Ooh,
he just hit that girl...
On the tape, all that remain now are Abed and Troy. Abed
remains motionless while Troy slowly melts down and exits. *
Abed is the only one left. He sits patiently, hands folded
in his lap. Prof. Duncan leans closer to the screen.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Ah, I’ve seen this before. The
longer they wait, the harder they
break. Buckle up, students.
(then, noticing)
Does he have a whip?
9 EXT. QUAD - LATER 9
Shirley and Jeff sit on the bench, laughing.
SHIRLEY
Oh, and have you seen how often
Hackey Sack takes his shirt off? *
He’d play shirts and skins in a
game of checkers. *
*

JEFF *
I am so glad to be able to talk
about that guy. I wanted to say
something to Britta but we’re *
supposed to be friends now and *
she’d think I was jealous. *
SHIRLEY *
I don’t see why you and Britta
aren’t together. Two cute white
people, going to school together,
just seems right.
JEFF
Shirley, we’re not pandas in a zoo.
SHIRLEY
(seeing something)
Oh dear.
Jeff looks. Britta and Vaughn make out on the quad.
JEFF
That is not what I want to see.
Britta looks up, sees Jeff watching her.
SHIRLEY
And there goes the shirt.
FADE OUT.

Britta approaches Jeff at a table.
BRITTA
Heeeey.

Hi, there. Want me to check you *

BRITTA *
That was... embarrassing. *
JEFF
Oh, whatever. Seize the day, man, *
life is short. Get up on that. *
You know? All aboard the *
dreamboat. *
BRITTA
I wasn’t sure when or how to bring *
up that I was hanging out with
Vaughn. Figured you’d... make fun
of him. And me.
JEFF
First of all, friends don’t make
fun of each other, and secondly,
(mustering) *
Vaughn seems cool. *
Britta is impressed with Jeff. *
BRITTA *
You guys should hang out. Well, *
I gotta go. That was tacky out *
there, you’ll never see it again. *
JEFF
No worries.

11 EXT. QUAD - NEXT MORNING (DAY 3) 11
Pierce talks to Shirley as they exit the school building from
before. He wears his Ear-Noculars and Bluetooth.
PIERCE
This thing is amazing. I could
finally hear Mr. Chang from the
back of the room. Too bad they
don’t make one of these for
accents. What’s that? What do you *
mean you got a hold of some “sweet *
weed”? *
SHIRLEY
Doesn’t it get confusing with the *
phone in one ear and that thing in *
the other? *
PIERCE
It’s called living in the modern *
world. *
His cell phone RINGS in his other ear. It’s very loud for *
Pierce and startles him.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
Hello. Mom? Yes, I’ll visit soon. *
What do you mean, “Do I want a *
toke?” Wait. Who’s about to bust *
you? What pigs? What pigs are *
coming? Just put Dad on. *
As Pierce walks off contorting in confusion, Jeff hurries up *
to Shirley.
JEFF
Shirley! Did you notice Sr.
Chang’s socks today? Tiny bull
fighters.
SHIRLEY
I can top that. Did you see Hacky
Sack wears an anklet?
Jeff doesn’t react. *
SHIRLEY (CONT’D) *
Since when won’t you talk about *

unpredictable. I’m going to show *
her I’m not the jerk she thinks I *

SHIRLEY
Okay, but tell me you’ve noticed
how small his nipples are.

Not engaging.
SHIRLEY
What? It’s not gossip if it’s
fact. My kids have had hamsters
with bigger nips.
12 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM/WAITING ROOM - LATER 12
The room is a complete mess, littered with take-out food
containers, crumpled pieces of paper and empty coffee cups.
Prof. Duncan, Annie and the other research assistants are
bleary eyed, but they continue to watch the monitor. On the
monitor, Abed happily sits in the same position.
PROF. DUNCAN
Is it on pause?
ANNIE
No, that’s just him.
Annie opens the door to the waiting room.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Sorry you’ve been waiting...
(checks her watch, sighs)
twenty-six hours. It will be...
five more minutes.
ABED
Okie doke.
Annie closes the door and goes back to the experiment room.
Prof. Duncan tugs at his hair.
PROF. DUNCAN
Why won’t he leave?! *
RESEARCH ASSISTANT #1
Professor, I have other classes I
have to--
PROF. DUNCAN *
Go! Fine! I hate you. Go kill *
John Lennon again, you loser. *
Research Assistant #1 leaves. Prof. Duncan turns to the
monitor.

PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
He’s ruining my study! He’s
warping the Duncan Principle. Damn *
you! Damn you, you outlying piece
of datum!
(punches monitor)
Ow!
(to Annie) *
YOU! This is all your fault! *
ANNIE
But you told me to bring subjects.
PROF. DUNCAN
Subjects! Not Rain Man! I should *
have never let you in this lab,
little Miss know-it-all, Annie
Fanny Panties in a bunch!
ANNIE
Oh, that’s sooo hilaaarious! Did
you think of that the last time you
skipped a trip to the dentist?
PROF. DUNCAN
Let me answer that question with
another question...
(makes raspberry noises)
Prof. Duncan starts yelling and stomping his feet in complete
exasperation. The other research assistants take notes on
his behavior. He notices.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
What are you doing?! Stop writing!
He grabs one of their composition notebooks and throws it at *
them. Terrified, the assistants scramble to the door. *
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Out! All of you! You’re all a *
bunch of dorks! *
(points at Annie) *
You destroyed the Duncan Principle! *

Prof. Duncan exits, slamming the door behind him. Annie, *
fuming, sits alone in the room. After a beat, she gets up
and opens the door to the waiting room where Abed is waiting
patiently.
ANNIE
Go home! *
She slams the door shut. WE STAY ON Abed, alone in the room.
ABED
Cool.
He gets up to go.
13 INT. CAFETERIA - LATER 13
Jeff sits with Britta and Vaughn.
JEFF
So Britta said you did a lot of
community service?
VAUGHN
Ultimate Frisbee at the Senior’s
Center. It’s amazing.
JEFF
And what makes frisbee ultimate?
VAUGHN
Aw, man, if I had a nickel for

Britta is happy they are getting along.
BRITTA
I’m gonna get dessert. Want anything?
VAUGHN
Uh, carrots? *
JEFF
I’m good.
Britta exits. Shirley sees Jeff and Vaughn sitting together.
She makes eye contact with Jeff and gives him a shit-eating
grin and saunters over.
SHIRLEY
Hey, you two.
(to Vaughn)
Well that’s a cool shirt.
VAUGHN
Thanks.
Jeff looks at Shirley like “what are you up to?”
SHIRLEY
Where’s it from?
VAUGHN
Uh? Let me see.
He takes his shirt off. Shirley, behind Vaughn’s back,
smiles big at Jeff.
VAUGHN (CONT’D)
Hanes. Classic.
SHIRLEY
That’s nice.
Vaughn turns back to Jeff, still with his shirt off. While
Vaughn talks to Jeff about volunteering, Shirley motions for
Jeff to check out the nipples. So small. Where are they?
Jeff tries not to laugh.
VAUGHN
You know, people underestimate the
elderly, but you should see these
guys out there throwing the bee,
loving life. It’s inspiring.
JEFF
I’ll think about it.

VAUGHN
No worries. Better check on Brits.
Vaughn exits. Shirley snickers while Jeff tries to suppress
a laugh.
JEFF
You are the devil.
Pierce and Troy walk up.
PIERCE *
Look what we’ve got here, Troy? A *
good old-fashioned clique.
JEFF
We’re not a clique.
PIERCE
I’m not naive. At Hawthorne Wipes,
my corporate board was torn asunder
by backstabbing and factionalism.
I’ve also seen “Mean Girls.”
(then)
So, what’s your plan? Pairing off
by twos? You, Shirley. Me, Troy.
TROY
I haven’t made a call on that yet.
PIERCE
We work so well as a group. Me,
Annie, Brittles, the Arab boy,... *
I just want you to think about that
before you throw it all away for a
sack of giggles.
Pierce strides off, letting his words sink in.

JEFF
He’s very cute. He’s got... *

BRITTA
I’m worried that he’s thinking more
intensely about this thing than me.
He says stuff, you know, after...
JEFF
After... school?
BRITTA
(means sex)
After.
JEFF
(disgusted)
You had sex with him?
(forcing enthusiasm)
What was it like? *
BRITTA
What? Forget that. *
(flustered) *
The problem now is he’s calling me *
babe and trying to hold my hand,
it’s getting relationship-y. And *
he gave me, ugh, I can’t.
JEFF
What?
BRITTA
You can’t tell anyone about this.
Britta hands over a piece of paper. Jeff looks at it.
Remains stone faced.
JEFF
It’s a poem.
BRITTA
How do I respond to something like *
that? “Thank you”? *
Jeff holds gold.

JEFF *
That’s a difficult question. Which *
I will answer, - oh, someone’s *
texting me.
Jeff pulls his phone out. He holds it up in front of his
face, between it and the poem. He pretends to study and
operate the phone while adjusting the angle of the phone and
the paper.
JEFF (CONT’D) *
(pretending to read)
Just have to read this text, *

Did you ever notice where the ocean

same wizard blue that I see in your
eye, Brit-ta.
SHIRLEY
(giggling)
Oh no, no, no. Wizard blue?
JEFF
Yes, yes, yes.
SHIRLEY
Oh, thank you. That has brightened
my day. I’m so glad we can rip on
that dude again.
JEFF
I’m trying to be a good friend to *
Britta, but I mean, the guy wrote a *
poem, right? Look. That’s the *
stain of a tear drop over the word,
“rad.”
Jeff and Shirley snicker. ANGLE ON Pierce, somewhere else on *
the quad, his Ear-Noculars pointed in Jeff and Shirley’s
direction. He clearly doesn’t like what he hears.
16 INT. STUDY ROOM - LATER 16
Abed and Troy are there. An exhausted Annie enters.
TROY
Hey, sorry for bailing on your
psych experiment yesterday.
ANNIE
(snapping)
That was the experiment, Troy. We
were testing how long people would
wait in the room.
This wrinkles Troy’s brain.
TROY
Whoa.

ABED
(understands; unphased)
Oh, gotcha.
ANNIE
“Gotcha”?! That’s all you have to
say? You sat in a room for twenty- *
six straight hours. No food, no
water. Didn’t that bother you?
ABED
(calm)
Yes. I was livid.
ANNIE
Then why didn’t you leave?!
ABED
Because you asked me to stay and
you said we were friends.
Annie doesn’t know what to say. She sits down, ashamed.
TROY
Aw, man...
(choking up)
That’s really beautiful.
(then)
Wait. Is this still part of the
experiment?
Jeff and Shirley enter, giggling and gabbing.
JEFF
...no, no. He’s more like a puppy
with a fish mouth.
SHIRLEY
Right, right, right. Like this...
Shirley does a Vaughn face. Jeff laughs. Pierce opens the
door to the study room and strides in.
PIERCE
That’s right. Laugh it up. You
guys want to know what they’re
doing right now? Making fun of all
of us. I heard you with my own
Ear... Noculars.

JEFF
Pierce, we--
PIERCE
Calling me “Hacky Sack,” ripping on
my six pack abs and my moist hair.
And apparently someone got a hold
of my poem. And that face she was
just making?...
(imitates Shirley’s “fish”
face)
That was obviously Annie.
TROY
Okay, this is definitely part of
the experiment.
SHIRLEY
Pierce, we weren’t making fun of you.
JEFF
We were talking about Britta’s
boyfriend, Vaughn.
PIERCE
(on a dime)
Oh, okay. Good.
(sits down; rubs hands
together)
But if we’re gonna do something,
let’s do it as a team. I’ll get
the ball rolling. Maybe he has a
tiny penis.
TROY
Who is this guy?
SHIRLEY
Oh, you all have to see him.
Everything’s, “no worries, no
worries.” And he always has to say
three greetings in a row. And show
them the poem.
Shirley takes Vaughn’s poem print out from Jeff and hands it *
over.
JEFF
Oh, maybe don’t show that. I don’t
think we should--
BRITTA (O.S.)
I should be done in an hour.

Hey guys, you’ve met Vaughn, right?
VAUGHN
Hey. What’s up. Hi.
Shirley holds up three fingers. The group tries not to laugh
but can’t hold it in.
PIERCE
(whispering too loud)
He’s a fool.
VAUGHN
Whoa, this group’s got a case of
the giggles. Tight.
Vaughn sits down at the table, moving the bag out of his way.
His poem is revealed.
VAUGHN (CONT’D)
Is that?

You showed them my poem? *
BRITTA
No.

I can’t believe I showed you that

Can we talk?
Jeff sighs and sits with Shirley.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Jeff. I have a gossip problem.
JEFF
I’m not a real supporter of this
word but... duh.
SHIRLEY
I stir the pot, Jeff. I’m a pot *
stirrer. This isn’t the only study
group I’ve had this year. See
those ladies over there?
ANGLE ON a group of African American women hanging out
together. One of them gives Shirley a dirty look.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
I was in that group until they
kicked me out. They call me
“Tattle-ina.”

It’s a bumblebee nickname. It’s
cute but it stings.
Jeff looks over at Shirley’s former study group.

her)
This is never going to work. It’s *

Shirley smiles. Jeff starts off.
SHIRLEY

Professor Duncan approaches.
DUNCAN
Oh Annie, there you are. You know, *
after I went home and drank and *
slept and drank some more, I
realized it was I who had reached a *
breaking point. I had been the *
subject of my own study. And I
LOVED it. Not only was the Duncan *
Principle upheld, I now have even *
more reason to study it. We’re *
running some new trials tonight if *
you’d like to assist. *
Annie looks at Abed then at the Professor. *

Oh. *
BRITTA *
You broke my trust. You suck. *

girls. What do you want to be? *

1 INT. STUDY ROOM - MORNING (DAY 1) 1
JEFF, BRITTA, SHIRLEY, ANNIE and PIERCE hang out. Pierce is
telling the world’s longest joke. Annie wears a sweatshirt
that reads, “Greendale Debate.”
PIERCE
...So then the guy says to the
housekeeper, “make sure she’s
dead.” Stop me if you’ve heard
this one.
JEFF
It would’ve been nice to have that
option twenty-seven minutes ago.
PIERCE
Anyway the housekeeper says, “we
don’t have a pool.”
(chuckles)
And the guy says...
DEAN PELTON (O.S.)
Good morning, Greendale! A few
quick announcements. The world
class Greendale debate team...
ANNIE
We are kind of kicking butt these
days.
DEAN PELTON (O.S.)
Will bring home the championship
tomorrow versus City College. On *
that there is no debate.
PIERCE
So the housekeeper says to the guy,
“we don’t have a pool,”
(chuckles again)
and the guy says...
DEAN PELTON (O.S.)
To be clear, “there is no debate”
is just a figure of speech. There
is actually a debate at eight P.M..
Go Human Beings!
PIERCE
Now I’ve got to start the whole
joke over. So there’s this guy on
a business trip...
BRITTA
No! I got one. A doddering old
fool walks into a bar, tells a
stupid joke, and I crush his
windpipe with my three ringed
binder.
The group sits in stunned silence.
SHIRLEY
(courtesy laugh, then)
I don’t get it.
JEFF
Britta’s trying to give up
cigarettes.
BRITTA
Don’t tell them my business. I’ll
smack that smug look right off your
pointy face.
JEFF
Okay, Britta, I’m saying this
because I’m your friend and because
I care about you. You need to
start smoking again.
ANNIE/PIERCE/SHIRLEY
He’s right. / You should. / It’s
really not that bad for you.
BRITTA
I appreciate your support, but I’ve
got to quit this time.
PIERCE
Have you tried hypnotherapy? I
know a dynamite hypnotherapist.
JEFF
Ten-to-one says it’s him.

Abed less inclined towards
terrorism. Jeff I could make you

JEFF
Can you help me block out people’s
voices I find extremely annoying?
PIERCE
(re: Britta)
Jeff, she’s right here.
BRITTA
Pierce, I would be grateful for
your help.
PIERCE
Really? Super. We’ll set it up.
Jeff pulls Britta aside and looks at her like she’s crazy.
BRITTA
What? I’m going to quit smoking
anyway. This way at least Pierce
can feel good about himself.
JEFF
And he would deserve that... why?
BRITTA
I feel sorry for him. He wants to
feel important so badly. Plus I
just yelled at him.
JEFF
You yelled at me too.
BRITTA
(baby talk)
Ohhh. Did I hurt your feelings
pointy face?
Troy enters with a lap top. He turns to Jeff. *
TROY

Troy opens his laptop and clicks a link. The group watches
Troy’s computer. An Abed film comes up. It’s very similar
to the scene in episode 107 where the group confronts Jeff
about sleeping in his car.
BRITTA
Those people look just like us.
It’s eerie.
SHIRLEY
Ooh. My character’s got it going
on. I’ve got to wear purple more.
BRITTA
We had almost that exact

Britta and Pierce approach a sound proof music room.
PIERCE
I reserved the music room for our
session.
They open the door. SR. CHANG is there jamming on a guitar.
He’s awesome, lost in a rock star fantasy. He notices them
and stops.
BRITTA
Wow. You’re amazing.
SR. CHANG
Thanks for the validation. Now my
life is complete.
He exits.
BRITTA
I really appreciate you helping me
out, Pierce.
PIERCE
And I appreciate the opportunity.
Sometimes I feel like people don’t
take me seriously.
Pierce references a hypnosis manual. He steps behind Britta
and reaches into his backpack.
BRITTA
(playful)
So what are you going to do? Wave
a pocket watch in front of my face
and tell me I’m getting

She turns to see Pierce holding an old-timey pocket watch.
PIERCE
Just checking the time.
Britta looks at him compassionately.

Whoa. Never noticed that before.
BRITTA

Pierce, I can’t thank you enough.
I really need your help. You have
so much to offer.
PIERCE
(happily surprised)
Thank you.

Jeff walks down a hallway. DEAN PELTON, PROFESSOR WHITMAN *

DEAN PELTON
Mr. Winger, did you happen to hear
my announcement this morning? *
JEFF
Absolutely. I hang on every word.
DEAN PELTON
I’m going to assume that’s sarcasm.
JEFF
Correct.
DEAN PELTON
So, you didn’t hear my *
announcement?

orator Simmons. *
PROF. WHITMAN *
Simmons. He’s a cerebral sequoia. *
If I were twenty years younger and *
not allergic to polyester, I’d don *

Jeffrey? It’s like I say in class, *

JEFF *
Pass. *
DEAN PELTON
Listen jerk-wad, Greendale needs a *
win. Since I’ve been here, the *
best compliment I’ve heard about
our sports program is that our
basketball team is really gay. So
what’s it going to take to get you
on board? A plum parking spot?
Free meals?
(suggestive)
A night of companionship if you
know what I mean?
JEFF
I’ll do it for the parking spot.
And if you promise not to tell me

Annie squeals with delight and the Dean and Whitman pat him *

Pierce trips and does a hard pratfall over some band
equipment.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
Oh God, I think I’m really hurt.
Somebody help me! Why did I put *
you under so well? Damn my talent! *
Britta surreptitiously opens one eye but is stuck pretending

PIERCE (CONT’D)
Primate. Ape. Chimpanzee. Robin *

Pierce pulls himself up to a window and screams.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
Help me!
Outside the window a STUDENT sees Pierce silently screaming
“help me”. He continues on.
5 INT. STUDY ROOM - LATER 5
The Group is filing in. Annie is mid-conversation with Jeff.
ANNIE
The topic for the debate is, “Are
people inherently good or evil?”
So when are we getting together to
strategize?
JEFF
Annie, I was a lawyer. I was a
debater for money. I’ve gone pro.
I think I can handle it.
Shirley, Troy and Britta enter. Shirley wears purple, just

him about his films.
SHIRLEY
The boy is flat out prescient. He

Abed enters. They all turn and stare at him.
ABED
I know what you’re going to say.
You saw my movies on the website.
SHIRLEY
He’s a witch!
TROY
Get him!
ABED
I’m not a witch. I’m a student of

I can predict how you’ll behave.
Like, Shirley, I know you’re a
sweet, Christian, generous person.

He hits a button on his laptop. A NEW FILM comes up. We see
“Jeff” kicking a vending machine and freaking out.
ABED (CONT’D)
Jeff’s character acts like nothing
around here affects him, but things
bother him more than he lets on.
He’s also very vain.
JEFF
Pfft. Ridiculous.
Jeff puts his foot on the table revealing his plaid socks
match his plaid button down. ON FILM we see Troy crying.
TROY
(re: film)
Why am I crying? Will I
accidentally listen to “Come Sail
Away” by Styx again? Stupid Styx.
Making me feel things.
ABED
You don’t have to worry, Troy.
It’s just a movie. I can’t predict
the future.

The court is set up for a debate: a podium, seats. Jeff is on
the Greendale side with Whitman and the Dean who’s flanked by *
the Human Being. There are a panel of judges and an audience
including our group. All debaters wear sweatshirts except
for Jeff. Annie is at the podium.
ANNIE
...As Golding’s Lord of the Flies
demonstrated, man...

will descend into chaos and evil.
She hits the podium with her fist a little late. She leaves
to a smattering of applause. The judges write notes.
DEAN PELTON
And now, for City College, Jeremy
Simmons.
City College students erupt with applause as SIMMONS emerges
in a motorized wheel chair. He sports a pony tail and
hipster facial hair. As the crowd chants, “Simmons!
Simmons!” he pumps one fist in the air, blows kisses to the
crowd, and shoots Annie a very seductive wink.
ANNIE

He thinks he’s so hot.
ANGLE ON Pierce in the audience.

of showboating arrogance. He wheels past Jeff and Annie.
SIMMONS (CONT’D)

Hey, beautiful. I see you’ve got a

Suck on my tail pipe, Yao Ming.
He stares Jeff down as he hits a button and motors off.
ANNIE
You’ve got to take him down Jeff.

Tell me, Jean. How many people
bothered to tell you how great you
look today?
JEAN
None.
JEFF
Man is evil.
JEAN
But you just said I looked great.
JEFF
For my own selfish purposes. The
fact is, as hot as you look, and
it’s quite hot, I wouldn’t have
said anything.
Jean melts again. She writes something.
JEFF (CONT’D)
When I talk about people being evil
I could cite quotes, or dig up

Counter point! *
SIMMONS

PROF. WHITMAN *

JEFF
Not ninety-percent. One-hundred
percent.
PROF. WHITMAN *
Rejoinder! *
The SAMOAN at the podium raises his hand to make a point,
hesitates, CUT before he speaks.
PROF. WHITMAN (CONT’D) *
Final arguments! This round will *
determine the winner.
ANGLE ON our group in the crowd.
PIERCE
This is a real barn-burner.
(notices Shirley)
Oh God, did I just say crossburner?
SHIRLEY
No you did not.
PIERCE
Oh good.
(to debate team)
Let’s go Klan!
(corrects on a dime)
Team!
Simmons is at the podium.
SIMMONS
Webster’s Dictionary defines
inherent as “existing in someone or
something as a permanent and
inseparable quality.” Permanent.

So for one to be “inherently evil”
one would need to be born that way.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you
this...
Simmons reaches behind the podium and holds up an adorable
BABY.
SIMMONS (CONT’D)
(re: baby)
Is he evil?
The City College side erupts. Simmons points to a teen
mother in a City College sweatshirt. She gives him a “way to
go” fist pump. Troy starts to applaud.
TROY
(off looks)
I’m sorry, that dude’s awesome.
ANGLE ON Simmons basking in his moment. ANGLE ON Britta
watching disappointed from underneath the bleachers.
BRITTA
Those guys are screwed.
She takes out a cigarette, then stops herself, staring at it
quizzically. ANGLE ON Whitman, the Dean and Annie *
devastated. Jeff confidently strides up to Simmons.
JEFF
(re: baby)
May I?
Jeff takes the baby, holds him up to eye level. The baby
slaps Jeff in the face as the crowd reacts amazed.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Actions speak louder than words. *
The crowd breaks into applause. They start chanting “Winger,
Winger, Winger.” He’s done it. He basks.
ANNIE
That was brilliant. How did you
know it would do that?
JEFF
Babies hate me. They can sense I
don’t care.
Whitman and the Dean are elated. *

SIMMONS (CONT'D)
DEAN PELTON
Winger, you did it! There’s no way
he can win in rebuttal.
PROF. WHITMAN *
Simmons is finished. *
Simmons is at the podium. He takes in the crowd, then
dramatically tosses his notes in the air as he motors
towards Annie and Jeff. The notes waft stylistically behind
him. The crowd ripples with anticipation.
ANNIE/CROWD/JUDGES
He’s abandoning his notes. / He’s *
going rogue. / It’s a gambit. *
Simmons gets closer to Jeff. JEFF’S POV. Simmons is about
to reach him, pulls the levers on two wheel breaks and
launches himself into the air SLO MO towards him. Jeff
instinctively catches him. A silent, stunned beat.
SIMMONS
(from Jeff’s arms)
People are inherently good.
The City College side goes nuts. Jeff is at a loss. Suddenly,
Annie grabs Jeff’s head and makes out with him. The crowd
reacts. Shirley reacts; “Abed was right.” Jeff submits to
the kiss, reaches to hug Annie while tossing a limp Simmons
to the floor. Simmons lands with a thud. Annie breaks the
kiss and turns to the crowd indicating Jeff and Simmons.
ANNIE
People are inherently evil!
The crowd goes BONKERS. It’s pandemonium.
JEAN
Greendale wins!
PROF. WHITMAN *
Huzzah! *
Simmons deflates. The Samoan starts to weep. The judges
hand the Dean a tiny trophy. He hoists it in the air.
ANNIE
(to Jeff)
That “off book” enough for you? *
JEFF
Eat that Simmons!

Jeff and Annie, lost in the moment, hug, then back away,
thinking better of it. He pats her on the head again as she
gives him an “attaboy” punch on the arm.

Shirley approaches Abed freaked out.
SHIRLEY
They kissed. You do have powers.
I’m going to die by werewolf!
ABED
Shirley, I don’t have powers.
Trust me. In my next film we
discover Pierce is an actual
genius.
SHIRLEY
That’s not happening.
ABED
No it’s not. And neither is the
werewolf.
She exits satisfied. Britta runs up to Pierce, elated. *
BRITTA
Pierce, I can’t smoke a cigarette *
anymore without thinking of a three *
way in your hot tub! You did it! *
PIERCE *
(beat, then bravado) *
Yeah, I did. *
Pierce reacts, pleased with himself. She puts her arm around
him as they pass Abed.
BRITTA *
You are a genius. *
Abed takes this in. *
PROF. WHITMAN *
Let’s celebrate outside. Looks *
like a full moon tonight. *
ABED

CLOSE ON a pair of shoes stomping frantically down
Greendale’s hallway.
2 INT. ADMIN MEETING ROOM - DAY 2
The RUNNER opens a door into this dark room.
RUNNER
(urgent)
City College has a space simulator. *
The silhouetted figures of DEAN PELTON and FACULTY are seated
at a table, lit only by a projector hooked up to a laptop.
FACULTY 1
We know.
FACULTY 2
Close the door.
The Runner closes the door and moves around the table to the
back of the room while the meeting continues.
DEAN PELTON
As I was saying. On Monday, City
College will be unveiling the City
College Cosmic Pioneer, their very
own orbital launch simulator.
The Dean brings up photos of the CCCP, City College’s barebones,
two-seat space flight simulator. City College’s DEAN
SPRECK can be seen in some of the photos, proud.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
It won’t be long before City
College is offering associate
degrees in aeronautics. City
College students will be getting
jobs at NASA. Pretty soon, they’ll
have an astronaut on their
brochure, and we’ll still be
bragging about our Foosball table!
He brings up an example of a Greendale brochure boasting
“Foosball!”
(CONTINUED)
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
What do you think happens to our
enrollment then?
The Dean brings up a powerpoint animation he’s prepared of a
city map, on which City College’s campus, drawn in red,
begins growing, eventually overtaking the green dot
representing Greendale.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
I don’t know about you gentlemen,
but I’m proud of my campus. I
don’t want to watch it become a
City College parking lot.
Murmurs of fear throughout the room.
FACULTY 1
Well, what can we do?
DEAN PELTON
We can beat them to the punch. We
can launch our own space simulator.
Before they simulate their launch *
Monday, we simulate a launch this *
weekend. We make Greendale, not
City College, the first community
college to pretend to put a man in
space.
FACULTY 1 *
Do we even have a simulator?
DEAN PELTON
We can get one. For six hundred
dollars plus towing costs.
The Dean brings up a site for the local museum. Then promo
photos, circa 1981, of families seated at space-age consoles.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
In 1980, the county museum had a
state of the art space mission
simulator sponsored by Kentucky
Fried Chicken, called The Kentucky
Fried Chicken Eleven Herbs and
Space Experience. It’s been in
storage since ‘99, and they’re
looking to unload it because
teenagers keep sneaking in and
smoking pot in it.

2 CONTINUED: 2
(CONTINUED)
We see the side of a Winnebago customized to look like a
rocket. The room marvels at it.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
Gentlemen, Greendale’s future.
Actually, that photo’s from the
past. Here’s one more current.
He switches to an unceremonious photo of the Winnebago in a
parking lot. It’s run down and covered in filth. The room
unmarvels.
FACULTY 2
It’s seen better days.
DEAN PELTON
I admit, it could use a good wash.
(dramatic)
And I’ve got just the crew to wash
it.
3 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY (DAY 2) 3
HEROIC MUSIC plays as JEFF, ANNIE, SHIRLEY, BRITTA, TROY,
ABED and PIERCE all walk towards camera in slow motion,
wearing painter coveralls and carrying buckets and brushes.
They’re not actually shot in slo-mo, they’re just moving
slowly, and everyone but Abed looks irritated at having to do
it.
JEFF
Can we stop walking in slo-mo now?
ABED
Twenty more yards.
PIERCE
You guys are walking in slo-mo?
FADE OUT.

ACT ONE
4 EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING (DAY 2) 4
The space bus is parked. Dean Pelton addresses the gang.
DEAN PELTON
(checking his watch)
You guys are an hour late.
ANNIE
(frustrated)
Abed kept making us redo our walk.
DEAN PELTON
I think you know the reason this *
group has been chosen for this job. *
To atone for the obscene entry you
submitted to the Greendale school
flag contest.
He holds up a color printout of a simple flag design, a blue
field behind a pink circle with arrows pointing outward.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
That’s right, I know this isn’t a *
symbol for the crossroads of ideas,
I now know it’s a butt. *
The group (minus Annie) stifles snickers.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
Keep snickering. Pack yourselves
with peanuts and really be
satisfied, because guess what?
This won. This is now our school *
flag forever. Proud of yourselves? *
The group is not displeased to hear that.
TROY
How do you know it’s our design?
We submitted it anonymously.
(realizing)
Oops.
DEAN PELTON
Wrong. One of you actually came
forward.
Everyone looks at Annie.
"Community" - #204 - "The Fundamentals of Flight" - Pink Draft - 8/22/10 4.
(CONTINUED)
ANNIE
(defensive)
What?
DEAN PELTON
Now, somewhere beneath this dirt is *
Greendale’s newest pride. My hope
is that while you scrub it, you’ll
find the school pride in your *
hearts. *
ABED *
When we finish cleaning it, do we
get to go inside?
DEAN PELTON
No. That’s a job for a group of *
upstanding students, who are *
training right now in the Simulator
Simulator. *
5 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 5
LEONARD sits in a cardboard box with buttons drawn in magic
marker. A SCIENCE STUDENT stands nearby with a clipboard.
LEONARD
Great job on this, it’s hard to
believe I’m not really not really
in space.
6 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 6
As before.
DEAN PELTON
I will be back to check on your
progress. I expect this craft to
be spic and span...
(catching himself)
Owe myself a quarter.
(correcting)
Squeaky clean in time for the
pretend launch in front of the
press at three o’clock.
Dean exits. The seven begrudgingly grab supplies and move *
toward the bus. *
BRITTA
(re: bus, to Jeff)
I remember this old thing.
"Community" - #204 - "The Fundamentals of Flight" - Pink Draft - 8/22/10 5.

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
During high school field trips,
we’d sneak into it and get
(conscious of Shirley)
to prayin’.
ANNIE
(checking her watch)
We should take a coffee break.
Let’s all get coffee, okay? Where
are Troy and Abed?
JEFF
I’m pretty sure they were finding
their way into this thing five
seconds after the Dean left.
ANNIE
What? We can’t do that.
Annie walks off towards the bus in search of the boys. *
7 INT. SPACE BUS 7
It’s made to look like a spaceship, with a lot of 80’s
videogame technology and some subtle Kentucky Fried Chicken
branding. The cabin door opens. Troy and Abed enter. *
Shirley follows. *
ABED
It’s more beautiful than I
imagined.
TROY
You’ve never been in it?
ABED
My dad never let me. He always had *
a grudge against fast food *
restaurants, they almost wiped out *
his falafel stand. But I’ve *
memorized every detail of this old *
girl on the internet. *
Annie enters.
ANNIE
Guys, we can’t be in here.
TROY
Then get out.
Jeff and Pierce enter. *

BRITTA (CONT'D)

JEFF *
(looking around) *
It’s pretty well preserved for *
something that survived the 80’s *
and, apparently, a local transient *
who liked to collect doll heads. *
REVEAL a bunch of dirty doll heads on a nearby shelf. *
PIERCE
Ah, the 80’s. Teen years, right
everybody? A truly rebellious
time.
ABED *
I feel like I’m under-dressed for
this. I’m going to get something
from the dorm.
Abed runs out. Britta and Shirley enter. *
ANNIE
Guys, seriously, I have to ask that
we all step out of here.
BRITTA
Or what, are you gonna tattle on us
like you did with the flag?
ANNIE
I didn’t tattle about the flag.
But, you shouldn’t have made it in
the first place. *
PIERCE *
Hey, if you love Greendale so much, *
why don’t you marry it?
SHIRLEY *
Pierce, don’t be cranky! *
Pierce heads for the door. *
PIERCE *
(near door)
Sorry, I get a little *
claustrophobic.
(off their concern)
No big deal as long as I’m near the
door. In closed spaces, I can get
a little, you know,
(imitating crazy person)
Agggghhh!

7 CONTINUED: 7
(CONTINUED)
He gestures wildly, accidentally striking a large button
next to the door. The door beeps and swings shut. We hear
it latch. The space simulator springs to life. Buttons
light up, computer screens turn on featuring an 80’s era,
Atari style rendering of a white haired man - S.A.N.D.E.R.S. -
whose rectangle mouth blinks with a pre-recorded audio track.
SANDERS
Greetings. I am Systematic Android
Network Diode Energy Rocket System,
but you may call me SANDERS.
Pierce tries to play it cool but is mashing at the door
button repeatedly.
PIERCE
I need this door open, okay? Can
we get this open?
BRITTA
Just find the handle. There’s
gotta be a handle on the door.
SHIRLEY
We don’t know that. It was the
80’s. All the people who made this
were on cocaine.
ANNIE
We... can’t be in here.
SANDERS
Just as Kentucky Fried Chicken’s
secret process seals in the flavor,
I’m sealing the cabin’s air so you
don’t explode on your journey.
PIERCE
What?!
TROY
What does that mean?!
SANDERS
Please find a seat, strap yourself
in and wait for Mission Control.
BRITTA
Everyone look for a handle to open
this DOOR!

7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
(CONTINUED)
JEFF
Can we just take a mental step
back, guys, and realize that we are
simply in a Winnebago, and will be
fine?
There’s a small jolt to the cabin. Everyone freezes. The
muffled sound of servos as the cabin starts tilting upward.
TROY
What the hell.
ANNIE
Oh God.
SANDERS
Please find a seat, strap yourself
in and wait for Mission Control.
JEFF
Okay, we might want to actually
find a seat and strap ourselves in.
Everyone starts doing so except Pierce.
PIERCE
No! I’m not strapping into a
coffin! We have to get out!
The servo sounds stop.
SANDERS
I hope you’ve found a seat. I want
you to be safe.
PIERCE
(taken aback)
Did you just threaten me?
JEFF
Pierce, you’re talking to an Atari
cartridge. Please sit down.
The bus lurches forward. Pierce stumbles down the aisle,
screaming while trying unsuccessfully to hold onto things.
We hear him hit the back wall with a thud.
TROY
We’re moving!
Britta looks at Jeff.

(CONTINUED)
BRITTA
This is all just part of the
simulation, right?
JEFF
I don’t think this is a simulation.
The camera pushes on him.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I think we’re being towed.
8 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 8
The front end of the bus has been hitched and raised by a
large tow truck, which now pulls it out of the lot. We watch
it go, then pan back to look at a row of handicapped parking
spaces, across which the bus had been parked.
After a moment, Abed approaches, dressed in a flight suit.
He stops where the bus was. He looks around. Finally, and
slowly... He looks up.
FADE OUT.

ACT TWO
9 EXT. ROAD - DAY (DAY 2) 9
We’re tight on the space bus “flying” down the road. Pull
out to reveal the tow truck, cruising along.
10 INT. SPACE BUS - CONTINUOUS 10
Troy and Annie are pounding on the front wall of the bus,
shouting “Hey!” “Can you hear us?” etc. Jeff is holding his
cell phone near the edge of the single large covered window.
JEFF
Forget it. Whoever’s towing us
can’t hear us. Can anyone get a
phone signal?
Everyone adlibs “no signal here,” “not me,” etc. Pierce is
in the back being tended to by Britta and Shirley. He
listens to his iPod.
PIERCE
Mine’s working, but it’s that black
guy with the wrong number again.
BRITTA
Pierce, we keep telling you, that’s
an iPod and you’re listening to
Wesley Snipes’ audio book.
PIERCE
Well, he sure hates the government.
Troy gets in the Captain’s chair, and studies the big monitor
at the front of the bus. On it is a five-way video display.
TROY
It’s a long shot, but maybe... if I
do this... it will solve everything.
(moves controls around)
Damn.
Annie keeps trying her phone, then throws it in frustration.
ANNIE
This is all my fault.
JEFF
Very much so.
(off her frown)
Hey, when you go fishing, sometimes
you catch a boot.
"Community" - #204 - "The Fundamentals of Flight" - Pink Draft - 8/22/10 11.

There’s a beeping sound coming from a futuristic looking CB
RADIO. Troy puts on a headset and hits a button.
TROY
Hello?
Intercut with:
11 INT. STUDY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11
Dean Pelton talks into a futuristic CB RADIO that matches the
one onboard. We hear Troy’s voice over a speaker.
DEAN PELTON
Where are you hoodlums?! Bring my
spaceship back!
TROY
I think we are about
(consults panel)
forty light years west of the
Buttermilk Nebula, although it’s
possible --
(peels it off)
Yeah, this is a sticker.
Jeff gives up finding a signal and puts on another headset.
JEFF
Hey. Terrible Dean. This thing is
being towed. With us in it.
DEAN PELTON
Ah. Ah. Okay, wait. So handicap
spots count on Saturdays?
JEFF
Assuming we don’t end up in a
compactor, when we get back, I am
going to step on you.
DEAN PELTON
As much as I might enjoy that,
Jeff, if you don’t get back in time
for the launch, City College wins,
and Greendale becomes just another
school on my resume that no one can
call because it doesn’t exist. Now
tell me where you are.

JEFF
In a moving cannister with no phone
and no GPS, because the only window
is sealed shut, so you tell us
something or stop wasting our time!
Jeff removes his headset and throws it down.
DEAN PELTON
Hello? Jeffrey? Damn it!
Abed is seated on the study room table, despondent.
ABED
It isn’t sealed shut.
DEAN PELTON
Hm?
ABED
The window isn’t sealed shut, it
slides open when you complete the
simulation.
DEAN PELTON
Well, can you talk them through it?
(moving to Abed)
Abed, if they can open that window
they can tell us where they are and
we can find them.
Abed looks into the Dean’s eyes.
ABED
I was supposed to be on that thing. *
I know how she works. *
DEAN PELTON
Hey. That’s why they need you to
bring her home. Okay?
Dean offers Abed the microphone. He takes it, nodding.
DEAN PELTON (CONT’D)
I’ll get us some coffee.
(to self, sing song)
Psychooooooo.
12 INT. SPACE BUS - CONTINUOUS 12
Troy is trying to keep two arrows -- marked “Herbs” and
“Spices” -- inside two erratically moving blocks of color.
The blocks are very small, so it’s nearly impossible.

ABED
Troy.
TROY
Abed?
ABED
You can get that window open by
doing the simulation. Look at the
panel on your left and tell me your
recipe.
TROY
Original.
ABED
How many pieces?
TROY
Six.
ABED
Flavor heading?
TROY
Tasty.
ABED
We need to get that up to
delicious.
TROY
That makes sense.
Troy flips a dial from “Tasty” to “Delicious.” The blocks of
color instantly grow to make the task slightly easier.
SANDERS
Excellent work, Captain. Now, keep
your herbs and spices balanced,
while the crew helps you with *
teamwork.
TROY
(looks back at crew)
Guys, we can get the window open if
you man your terminals and we
complete the simulation.
Jeff has a fire extinguisher.

claustrophobic, rocking, freaking out. *
PIERCE
Gooby dooby gooby dooby gooby!
We’re all dying, we’re all going to
die! We’re dying!
Troy sweats, working the controls. On screen, his blocks of
color narrow. He can’t keep the arrows inside the margins.
SANDERS
My readings indicate the need for
cooperation.
TROY
I can’t do this by myself! *
JEFF
Well, I’ve got great news. You’re
playing a video game.
SANDERS’ voice seems to change slightly.
SANDERS
My readings indicate Pierce.
PIERCE
Huh? What?
SANDERS
Pierce. My readings indicate
you’re going to die alone.
PIERCE
Why is he saying that?! Why is he
saying that to me?!
SHIRLEY
He’s getting worse.
Troy struggles with his controls.
TROY
I’ve almost got it.

Pierce attacks Troy. Troy loses control of the game again.
13 INT. STUDY ROOM 13 *
A little later. Now it looks like Mission Control, with *
several STUDENTS manning computers, pouring through *
printouts. A STUDENT enters with a laptop and a “special *
drink” with a straw. Abed takes the drink and wordlessly *
directs him to put the laptop down in front of him, all while *
he talks on the microphone, checking in on Troy’s progress. *
ABED
Kentucky One? Kentucky, do you
read me?
CHANG comes up to Abed holding a strange contraption.
CHANG
I’ve worked out a way for them to
reroute the power from the
auxiliary battery.
ABED
To what?
Chang slowly backs away, bluff called. The Dean enters
holding a map. He spreads it on the table.
DEAN PELTON
Everybody! Here is the situation!
This is Greendale.
(draws a dot)
This is the maximum distance from
Greendale we can drive, to haul
them back up in time for the
simulated launch. *
(draws a large circle)
And these are city impound lots,

TROY
Well, we’ve stopped moving. And
Pierce has space madness, or he’s
just old or something, they’re
locking him up in the back!
Indeed, Jeff and Britta are wrestling a frenzied Pierce into
a storage cage in back and locking the door shut.
PIERCE
You can’t do this to me!
BRITTA
We just did!
ANNIE
Guys, please! You’re becoming animals!
BRITTA
Oh, shut up, Annie, we wouldn’t
even be here if it weren’t for you.
The others agree.
ANNIE
That’s not true, we weren’t supposed to
be in here when it happened!

Silence. All eyes on her.
JEFF
When what happened?
(offering)
When we got towed?
SHIRLEY
How did you know it was going to
get towed?
ANNIE
I set it up! I called City College *
about transferring and the dean *
said he’d let me in if I helped *
sabotage Greendale’s launch. I was *
supposed to make sure no one was
around so they could steal it. And
then you guys were late, and
then...
BRITTA
You’re transferring?
PIERCE
(foreign-sounding gibberish)
Shabba dabba dabba!
ANNIE
You all thought that butt hole flag
was so funny ... but... I need to
be proud of the school I go to.
SHIRLEY *
...Why? *
ANNIE *
What do you mean, why? There is no *
why, I need to be proud of the *
school I go to. That’s the *
because. The “why” is why am I *
leaving Greendale. The “because” *
is because I need to be proud of my *
school. What kind of question is *
“why?” What more information do *
you need? Is there something wrong *
with your brain? *
JEFF
Hold it hold it. City College was
behind this?
(deciding)

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
We have to get back in time for
that launch.
BRITTA
Why?
JEFF
Because we earn the right to pick
on Greendale, every day, by going
there. Our school may be a toilet,
but it’s our toilet, nobody craps
in it but us.
BRITTA
He’s right. When it comes to me
versus Greendale, I’m on my side,
but Greendale versus City College?
SHIRLEY
Yeah. How evil does a school have to be
to bother picking on Greendale?
JEFF
(to Troy)
Captain?
TROY
Get to your stations.
(calling out)
Thrusters!
Single shot of each person taking their station. *

Suppertime.
15 INT. STUDY ROOM 15
Abed perks up when he hears Troy’s voice on the speaker.
It’s crackling, and Abed can’t hear.
ABED
Everybody be quiet!
(to Troy)
Say again?
TROY
Greendale, standby for location!
16 INT. SPACE BUS 16
The crew works together from their terminals. On the main
screen, we watch Troy’s colored bars grow wider and wider.
TROY
Hold it! Hold it!
Suddenly, the main screen clears to display 8-bit fireworks.
SANDERS
Congratulations, crew. You’ve *
worked together! Now, feast your *
eyes on the wonders of the cosmos.
Our gang jumps up and stands at the window. An exterior
window shade lowers. Golden sunlight comes streaming in.
17 INT. STUDY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 17
Abed and everyone in Mission Control wait tensely.
ABED
What do you see, gang?
18 INT. SPACE BUS - CONTINUOUS 18
Jeff looks out the window. His POV: a wide-open pasture with
a cow in it. He holds his phone to the window, gets a signal.

The space bus has been unhitched and is parked by itself in
the middle of a rural field, surrounded by cows.
JEFF (O.S.)
Coldwater.
20 INT. STUDY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 20
Abed looks at the Dean. He locates Coldwater on the map, and
draws a line to it from Greendale. The line goes way up past
all the checkpoints he circled earlier.
ABED
Here. Next to the truck stop with
three thumbs up.
The Dean turns away from Abed, speaks to nobody. All is lost.
DEAN PELTON
(dramatic)
Those aren’t thumbs.
JEFF (O.S.)
(over CB)
Greendale, do you copy? Greendale?
Abed takes a breath.
ABED
I’m sorry, Jeff.

The group stands in silence as Abed finishes his thought.
ABED
I’m afraid you’re out of town.

ACT THREE
22 INT. SPACE BUS - DAY 22
The gang sits huddled together, dejected. Pierce is still in
the cage.
SHIRLEY
I guess someone will come get us
eventually.
TROY
I really miss Greendale. How many
schools would let you make a “butt
flag” and then actually fly it?
BRITTA
How many schools would let you get
a degree in Theoretical Phys-Ed?
SHIRLEY
Annie, we owe you an apology. You
should never have to choose between
your friends and your school.
ANNIE
Thanks.
BRITTA *
But you really shouldn’t have *
tattled for the flag thing. *
Beat.
JEFF
I tattled. I told the dean it was
our design. And I told him it was
a butt, too.
Everyone adlibs: “What?” “Why?” *
JEFF (CONT’D)
He kept not seeing it! It was *
driving me crazy. I mean it says
“E Pluribus Anus” on it. I had to
point it out to him or it was all
for nothing.
TROY
I told you guys we should’ve put
cheeks on it. There’s a time and
place for subtlety, and that time
was before they made “Scary Movie.”
"Community" - #204 - "The Fundamentals of Flight" - Pink Draft - 8/22/10 22.
(CONTINUED)
PIERCE
(calmly, sanely)
Guys. I’m really feeling a lot *
better now.
SHIRLEY
Oh. You sound good.
PIERCE
Yeah. In a weird way, I think
being in this smaller space helped
me work through some stuff. Can *
you let me out? *
They look at each other. Britta gets up and unlocks the door
to the cage. Pierce gets out, centers himself, then:
PIERCE (CONT’D)
I’ll kill you!
Pierce runs wildly at the monitor. We see Sanders’ 8-bit
mouth open as if in fear. Pierce attacks the monitor,
ripping it off the wall and throwing it to the ground. He
starts stomping on it.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
Get off my mommy! I’m her man! *
SHIRLEY
Pierce!
The others rush to stop him, except for Jeff, who sees
sunlight shining through a hole where the monitor was. He
looks into the hole.
Jeff’s POV: we can see the interior of the Winnebago’s cab on
the other side. Jeff turns to the others.
JEFF
Hey. Who’s feeling skinny?
Troy and Annie raise their hands.
23 INT. STUDY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 23
Abed sits at the table alone. The Dean finishes putting on a
bow tie.

DEAN PELTON
Time to face the music.
He turns to leave and bumps into DEAN SPRECK.
DEAN SPRECK
Craig.
DEAN PELTON
Stephen. Surprised to see you
here.
DEAN SPRECK
You don’t think I’d miss your
moment of triumph, do you?
Greendale beating City College into *
simulated space. Unless... you’re
having trouble locating your ship. *
DEAN PELTON
You?! You’re behind this?
Spreck leans in, close to Dean Pelton’s ear. He whispers *
softly, and Pelton reacts with a mix of horror and arousal. *
DEAN SPRECK *
Next time you provoke City College, *
you’ll lose more than a Winnebago. *
He walks out. Dean Pelton runs after him. *

31 INT. SPACE BUS 31
The crew tumbles. Britta falls on top of Troy. Their faces
get romantically close.
The same thing happens with Pierce and Jeff.
PIERCE
Hi.
JEFF
Will you get off me.
32 EXT. QUAD 32
Dean Pelton walks slowly across the quad, stalling for time.
Dean Spreck follows him, taunting.
DEAN SPRECK
They’ll never make it back, Craig.
That thing might as well be on a
simulation of the moon.
The Space Bus barrels onto the quad. *
It knocks over a couple easels and tables stacked with *
flyers. It almost hits a guy who dives out of the way at the *
last second. (other physical bits?) Also, maybe Dean sees it *
coming and takes the podium here? *
The bus screeches to a tire-smoking stop behind the ribbon. *
CHILDREN from around the neighborhood come running after it,
cheering.
PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures and roll video as Annie climbs *
down from the cab, walks over to the main cabin door and
opens it.
Pierce runs out first, straight through the crowd, screaming,
and into the distance, never looking back.
One by one, the rest of the study group exits the Winnebago,
waving to photographers and high-fiving the crowd.
The Dean runs up to the podium.
DEAN PELTON
Ladies and gentlemen, returning
from their maiden simulation, the
fabulous Greendale Green-stronauts!

Annie is receiving congratulations from strangers when Dean
Spreck approaches her.
DEAN SPRECK
Well, Annie. I guess you’re not
City College material after all.
ANNIE
Thank you.
ANGLE ON Troy wading through the admiring crowd when he sees
Jeff. They shake hands and pull into an embrace.
JEFF
Hey. Great job up there, captain.
TROY
Really? You think I could be an
astronaut some day?
JEFF
If NASA ever needs someone to keep
an arrow inside a moving rectangle,
I know who I’d recommend.
Troy smiles, genuinely touched. Abed approaches.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Abed. Want to take a seat in the
captain’s chair? I think you’ve
earned it.
Abed gives the space bus a long hard look.
ABED
No thanks. I can’t imagine
anything could be cooler than what
I’ve already done today.
Troy, Jeff, and Abed look at the ship a while. *
It bursts into flames. The crowd screams and scatters. *
ABED (CONT’D)
Ok, that was cooler.
We pan up to the new Greendale butt flag, flying proudly over
the smouldering bus and the rest of the Greendale campus.
FADE OUT.

33 EXT. OUTER SPACE (GREEN SCREEN) 33
Abed sits in the cockpit of a cardboard space ship, flying
through space. It’s NOT a cheesy green-screen effect, it’s a *

imaginations. This is not a video Abed is making. The ships *
are cardboard and home-made. *
ABED
I’ve got the target. Going in. *
Troy “flies” up right next to Abed. *
TROY
I’m not letting you do this alone. *
ABED
Damn you to hell, Troy, we both *

Damn YOU! You think you’re the *

They high-five, then peel off, firing ping-pong ball cannons
mounted on their space ships.

FADE IN:
1 INT. STUDY ROOM - NIGHT 1
All are seated around the table. They wear party hats and
some have noisemakers. There is a cake on the table.
ALL
(singing)
...to youuuu!
They cheer Troy. Pierce is confused.
PIERCE
Well, that was just weird. Why did
we only sing the last two words?
What happened to the “Happy
Birthday” part?
SHIRLEY
You know Troy is Jehovah’s Witness,
they don’t celebrate birthdays.
ABED
Annie and I did our best to keep
the language on the cake compliant.
TROY
(reading cake)
“Hello During a Random Dessert.”
(reading more)
“The month and day of which
coincide numerically with your
expulsion from a uterus.”
(touched)
You guys. I never cry, but...
BRITTA
All right, happy expulsion, Troy,
but after cake, we cram, for
realsies. Finals are coming up.
JEFF
Yeah, this group is starting to use
special occasions to avoid
studying. Last week we had fondue
and played Boggle because Shirley’s
niece took her first bath.
(CONTINUED)
ABED
With bubbles.
SHIRLEY
(to Abed)
Thank you.
(to Jeff)
It’s a milestone.
PIERCE
Funny, because my birthday was last
week and nobody noticed. Or cared.
Everyone goes quiet and exchanges guilty looks. Then:
JEFF
Pierce... you don’t remember the
huge party we threw you? We need
to talk about those painkillers --
PIERCE
(covering)
Gotcha! I remember my party,
stupid!
(chuckling, nervous)
That was some party.
Everyone sighs, relieved, and gives Jeff looks of gratitude.
Abed even says “Nice” and gives Jeff a thumbs up.
TROY
(experimenting, to Pierce)
You still owe me for the keg
deposit.
PIERCE
You think I don’t know that?
BRITTA
(admonishing)
Troy.
Troy looks at her and nods in recognition he went too far.
JEFF
Troy.
Troy looks to Jeff, who gives him a thumbs up.

Troy is opening a gift from Abed. It’s a video game. He
knows what it is before he finishes opening it. So excited.
TROY
Kickpuncher: Detroit?! No way!
This is sold out everywhere!
ABED
Not everywhere. I have a cousin
in Detroit, they’re not crazy about
it there.
TROY
This is how you turn twenty. Thanks.
They do the Troy-Abed five. Pierce struggles with the cake.
SHIRLEY
Here, let me help --
PIERCE
I broke my legs, not my gender.
Shirley backs off. Pierce starts cutting the cake, mangling
it while everyone watches in silence. Annie unfolds a paper.
ANNIE
While we’re... watching this unfold,
some birthday facts to enjoy:
Troy’s birthday is tomorrow,
December 4th. Also born that day:
Tyra Banks, Marissa Tomei and French
cinematographer Claude Renoir.
TROY
Jackpot!
ANNIE
On the Chinese calendar, Troy is a
horse, like me: Purposeful, selfpossessed
and gregarious.
TROY
No, I’m pretty sure I’m a snake. I
remember, because I’m determined,
self-possessed and mendacious.

JEFF
Pierce, what is this, what are you
doing? Explain yourself.
Pierce has mangled the cake beyond recognition.
PIERCE
Who made this crappy cake?
ABED
A cake maker. At a cake store.
PIERCE
Well, he did it wrong.
ANNIE
Troy. We’re 1990, we’re horses.
TROY
I was born in ‘89.
JEFF
Then... you were born twenty-one
years ago.
TROY
Which makes me twenty... because
everyone is ten for two years.
(getting concerned)
Because fifth grade is really
hard... for everyone.
(realizing)
MOM! How many lies am I living?!
BRITTA
Do you understand, at midnight, you
turn twenty-one. As in drinking
age?
TROY
Whoa!
JEFF
Okay, this party just became
unacceptable. We’re going out.
BRITTA
Yep.
Jeff and Britta start gathering their stuff.

his first bath, only the bubbles
are his manhood.
TROY
(to Shirley)
I want to bathe in manhood!
JEFF
I’m taking you to Johnny’s.
BRITTA
Ucch. You mean douchey’s?
JEFF
Oh, of course you hate cool bars.
I don’t suppose you’ve even been to
Johnny’s.
BRITTA
(cocksure)
Hey, I’ve never been to Beirut,
either,...
(adjusting PCness)
And I...probably will go there, one
day, because I’m sure it has a lot
of interesting culture, --
(over their groans)
Unlike Johnny’s, which is douchey!
JEFF
Let’s hear your suggestion.
BRITTA
The Red Door.
JEFF
Oooooh, the Red Hipster?
BRITTA
It’s not hipster. Hipsters haven’t

You guys, all you think about is
yourselves. Think about me. I’m
nineteen, I can’t get into a bar.
JEFF
Well...
They all shrug. Annie starts to “almost cry.”
ANNIE
Okay, well... have fun...
BRITTA
Okay, I’ll get Annie an ID.
ANNIE
A fake ID?
BRITTA
It’ll be real, it just won’t be
yours.

Meet you at the Red Door.
JEFF
Nice try. We’re not going to Red
Poet’s Society.
BRITTA
Not going to Douchey Cologne’s.

Fine, on the count of three, name

They have all left.

He tries to work his chair. It starts moving backwards.

Shirley drives. Britta in passenger seat. Annie in the
back, studying her fake ID.
ANNIE
I don’t think this girl looks very
much like me.
BRITTA
She’s a white brunette.
ANNIE
So is Anne Hathaway.
SHIRLEY
(waiting for the rest)
Go on...
ANNIE
And what is your friend doing with
a stack of other people’s IDs?
BRITTA
Don’t know. Sometimes people sell
their ID when they’re leaving the
state and need cash.

You don’t need an accent.

Jeff is driving. Troy is in the passenger seat, Abed in
back. They have Britta on his car’s speaker phone.
BRITTA
What?
JEFF
Flannahan’s Hole is closed. That’s
not... I’m not being clever, I mean
it’s out of business.
BRITTA
Well, that’s what they get for
trying to please everyone.
(to Jeff)
So now what?
JEFF
There’s a place on Third and Water.
It’s fun divey but not staph
infection divey, it’s got either a
really gross name or an ironically
fancy one, possibly both --

BRITTA
Oh. The Ballroom. Good.
(to Shirley)
Go to Third and Water.
SHIRLEY
Wait, why? That wasn’t the deal.
BRITTA
Shirley’s pushing back.
JEFF
Why, because they don’t have
plastic menus and milkshakes?
BRITTA
Why, because they --
JEFF
Don’t repeat it, you goon! Look,
just... the women are your problem,
the men are going to The Ballroom.
And now I guess I am being clever.
As Jeff hangs up, the boys take over the whole screen.
TROY
So, plastic menus are bad? See,
this is the kind of stuff I need to
learn, plastic menus seem like a
great idea to me. For when you
spill something on them.
JEFF
You’re entering a new chapter of
your life, Troy. Sadly, it’s the
final chapter, but it’s also the
longest, and if you play it right,
the best. You and I are just two
guys, now. Peers. Equals.
TROY
So awesome. Maybe later I can
drive your car?
Jeff just starts laughing like he knows Troy is totally
kidding. Troy joins in after a while as if he was. Abed
joins in, imitating their laughter. Jeff’s phone rings.
Jeff reads his dash display.
JEFF
Shh! Shh. It’s Chang.

No party. Finals week.
CHANG
Yeah, you’re not going out for a
little study break?
JEFF
Wish we could. Hunkered down, man,
gotta study, gotta study hard.
In Chang’s panel, reveal he’s in the study room.
CHANG
Uh-huh. That’s cool. You guys
keep studying.
Chang’s panel takes over the full screen. He hangs up his
clamshell phone while staring at the study room table in
front of him. He dips a finger into the mangled cake.
CHANG (CONT’D)

Jeff, Troy and Abed approach a BOUNCER. Troy holds out his ID.
TROY
Good evening, former enemy.
JEFF
He’s 21 at midnight. Cool?
The bouncer scrutinizes the ID, then waves him through.
BOUNCER
Happy birthday.
As Abed and Jeff present their IDs, the girls approach.

Caroline Decker from Corpus --
BRITTA
Annie, you don’t need an accent.
ANNIE
If my ID says Texas, they’ll be
suspicious --
BRITTA
(confides in her)
Look, they’re not going to question
your ID because you’re a hot girl.
We’re good for business. The
hotter you are, the more they’ll
risk the fine.
SHIRLEY
I don’t like this place.
BRITTA
You’ve been clear about that,
Shirley. Oy vey.
Annie walks up. Holds out her ID.
ANNIE
(half committed) Howdy?
The Bouncer waves her in, doesn’t care. Britta holds up her
ID, he takes it. Inspects it very carefully. Checks out the
edges. Uses an ultraviolet light on it. He hands a
devastated Britta her ID.
BOUNCER
Can’t be too careful.
Britta enters. The bouncer sees Shirley. He lights up.
BOUNCER (CONT’D) Shirley? Hey girl! Welcome back.
He goes in to hug her. She stops him.
SHIRLEY

You don’t know me.
She walks in.

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
7 INT. BAR - THAT NIGHT 7 *
It’s a dive bar. There are Polaroids of drunk patrons on the *
walls everywhere. Jeff, Britta, Annie, Troy, Abed and *
Shirley sit in a booth. Jeff and Britta each have cocktails. *
JEFF *
This place is all right. *
BRITTA *
Yeah, it’s okay. *
TROY *
(re: Polaroids) *
These pictures must be of all the *
regulars. You think someday I’ll *
make it up on this wall? *
JEFF *
I don’t say this often, Troy, but *
dream a little smaller. *
Shirley glances at the photos stapled to the wall, and does a *
double take when she sees: *
SHIRLEY’S POV - insert of one of the Polaroids, which depicts *
a shit-faced Shirley holding two beers, looking corpse-like. *
She puts her purse in front of it. *
ANNIE *
Oh no! *

I forgot to text Pierce. He thinks *
we’re going to Flannahan’s Hole. *
8 EXT. FLANNAHAN’S HOLE - NIGHT 8 *
Pierce is in front of Flannahan’s Hole, staring at the *
boarded up doors in a silent anger. *

Chang emerges from the shadows, regarding Pierce. *

Pierce is clearly considering it, when his phone beeps. He *

PIERCE *

No thanks. *
Pierce turns his chair around and starts rolling away. *
9 INT. BAR - NIGHT 9 *
At the booth, Shirley is casually trying to pull the Polaroid *
of herself off the wall without being seen. *
The BARTENDER stops by while grabbing empties. *
BARTENDER *
You guys need anything? *
Shirley yelps, startled, which startles everyone. *
SHIRLEY *

I’m okay. *
JEFF *
Another Macallan’s, neat. *
BRITTA *
Vodka neat four olives. *
TROY *

relieved and a bit exhilarated. *
BRITTA *
Annie, you made it in, you don’t *

ANNIE *
I don’t know how it works, I’m not *

Shirley successfully gets her photo off the wall. *

11 INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS 11 *
Abed is nearby, playing a Galaga machine. A NERDY GUY seated *
at the bar sees Abed and walks over. *
NERDY GUY *
Careful. You score any higher on *
that thing and the Rylans are going *
to recruit you to fight the Ko-Dan *

Abed lets go of the joystick and looks at the nerdy guy. *
ABED *
You’re a fan of the sci-fi original *

NERDY GUY *

Shirley walks by, scanning photos on the wall. Finally, she *
finds another of herself, looking ridiculously drunk and *
downtrodden, flipping off the camera. Distressed, she peels *
it off the wall and continues. *

13 INT. VESTIBULE OF BAR - CONTINUOUS 13 *
Pierce rolls into the bar’s tiny vestibule. He tries to roll *
into the bar, but it requires too sharp a turn. He bangs *
around in the vestibule trying to maneuver himself into a *
better position. He cannot. *
The bouncer enters after a while. *
BOUNCER *
Do you need help, man? *
PIERCE *
Oh, yeah, you’d like that wouldn’t *
you? Little turning of the tables? *
The bouncer frowns and leaves. Pierce keeps trying to *
negotiate the vestibule’s impossibly angled doorways. The *
bouncer pokes back in, confused from earlier. *
BOUNCER *
The turning of what tables? *
PIERCE *
I don’t know, leave me alone! *

Jeff, Britta and Troy. Jeff and Britta have a few empties in *

an eager eyed Troy in Scotch drinking. *
JEFF *
With an aged Scotch, never use ice. *
TROY *
Never use ice. Got it. Why? *

ABED *
I always thought it’s possible the *
wormhole Chrichton fell through *
moved him across not only space, *

Sebaceans could be our future *
selves, and Chrichton is longing *
for a planet that no longer exists. *
NERDY GUY *
You’re really nursing that beer. *
Abed takes a small sip. *
ABED *
Which would make sense, because *
what kind of wormhole would it be *
if it could only move you from one *
place to another within the same *
galaxy on the same day? *
NERDY GUY *
Speaking of wormholes, suppose we *
used one to...teleport this *
conversation somewhere more *
private? *

That doesn’t make sense. Wormholes *

things. That’s what I’ve been *

Annie’s my friend. She goes to *
school here. Thinks she’s got it *
allllll figured out. She wants to *
major in healthcare management. *
What does that even mean? *

No idea. *
ANNIE *
I’ll tell you what it means. A *
master’s degree. Followed by an *

DEXTER
“Seeing Red”
FADE IN:
1 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 1 (MORNING) 1
CLOSE on a LOCKSMITH changing out the locks in the kitchen.
Nearby, DEXTER stuffs lunch boxes into backpacks. Behind
him, CODY and ASTOR finish bowls of cereal at the table.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I’m very good at problem solving. I
take ugly messes and find permanent,
albeit bloody, solutions.
Dexter turns toward the table and claps his hands.
DEXTER
C’mon buckaroos, it’s Monday. Can’t
be late on Monday. Throws the whole
week off.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But when it comes to other people’s
problems, I go with a lighter touch.
As the kids rise from the table and take their backpacks
from Dexter, RITA barrels into the kitchen, half-dressed in
a blouse and slip.
RITA
Wait -- what about breakfast?
DEXTER
Made and eaten.
RITA
And the kids’ lunches?
DEXTER
Packed and ready to go.
RITA
Did you tell the locksmith --
DEXTER
New locks on every door. Reinforced
strike plates. Seven-pin keyways.
Rita exhales and leans against a counter, still shaken from
last night’s violent encounter with Paul. Dexter turns to
Astor and Cody.
DEXTER
Why don’t you kids wait in the car? I
wanna talk to your mom for a sec’.
ASTOR
Are you gonna make-out?
DEXTER
None of your business.
ASTOR
Are you?
RITA
(cautioning)
Astor.
Astor whispers something to Cody making him giggle and they
run for the door. Rita busily starts clearing the table.
DEXTER
You don’t have to do this, you know?
Getting attacked by your ex-husband
merits a day off.
RITA
I’m fine. I’m not going to let Paul
control my life. Those days are over.
Dexter gently takes her hands.
DEXTER
Everything’s going to be okay. The
police have been notified. They’ll
find Paul.
RITA
What if they don’t?
DEXTER
Then aim for the eyes.
He pulls a can of PEPPER SPRAY from his jacket. Rita takes
the can and gives Dexter a grateful hug.
2 INT. POLICE STATION - KITCHEN - DAY 1 (MORNING) 2
DEBRA wolfs down leftover birthday cake and coffee. DOAKES
enters. Debra holds up the chocolaty-looking cake.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 2.
1 CONTINUED: 1
DEBRA
Want some? It’s Kirk Blylock’s cake.
DOAKES
Had some. At Kirk’s birthday, ten
days ago.
Debra looks down at the cake with suspicion.
DOAKES
See? You have lunch every day with
your boyfriend, you miss a thing or
two around here.
DEBRA
(smiling)
We’re going for sushi today.
(takes another bite)
The cake’s still good. It’s mocha, I
think.
DOAKES
It started out vanilla.
A nearby YOUNG CLERK calls out --
YOUNG CLERK
Hey, somebody get over here!
Debra and Doakes walk to the rattled clerk, who stands over
a half-opened SHIPPING BOX, holding up a MASON JAR filled
with what looks like BLOOD.
DOAKES
For God’s sake, Park. Put that down.
YOUNG CLERK
It was addressed to “Homicide.”
DOAKES
Put it down!
The clerk sets down the bottle.
DEBRA
Jesus. Is that blood?
Curious DETECTIVES walk over for a look. Doakes spots
Dexter working in his lab, wearing latex gloves.
DOAKES
Morgan, get your ass over here.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 3.
2 CONTINUED: 2
DEXTER
Ass en route.
DOAKES
You’re the blood expert. What is this
shit?
Dexter lifts the jar and examines it, intrigued.
DEXTER
Little watery for jam.
YOUNG CLERK
Maybe you should open it.
DEXTER
But what if there’s an air-born toxin
waiting to be released?
YOUNG CLERK
I gotta wash my hands.
The clerk hurries away.
DEXTER
So gullible.
LAGUERTA pushes to the front.
LAGUERTA
All right people, settle down.
(turns)
Dexter, what can you tell me?
DEXTER
It’s blood, all right. Wait.
There’s something inside here.
Dexter has turned the bottle onto its side and holds it over
a desk lamp. He peers under the bottle to see an old-style
HOTEL KEY pressed against the glass. It has the name of a
hotel, MARINA VIEW HOTEL, and a room number, 103, etched on
the plastic emblem.
DEXTER
The Marina View Hotel. Maybe it’s
some kind of promotional gag. Y’know,
cups, T-shirts... that sort of thing.
LAGUERTA
Show and tell’s over. Let’s find out
who sent this mystery jar of joy.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 4.
2 CONTINUED: (2) 2
(MORE)
Doakes. Grab Batista and get out to
that hotel.
DEBRA
Batista’s covering the explosion at
the smack lab.
DOAKES
Put the cake down, Morgan. You’re
with me.
She takes one last hungry bite, sets down the cake, and
follows Doakes out. Dexter peers into the Mason jar.
DEXTER (V.O.)
A jar of blood. Somebody sure knows
how to get my attention. Dramatic.
Cryptic. Playful. Could it be him?
Off the trace of a smile forming on Dexter’s lips...
3 EXT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - ESTABLISHING - DAY 1 3
An elaborate beach-themed HOTEL -- cheesy, touristy and
borderline unsanitary. Doakes’ sedan is parked out front.
4 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 1 4
Debra stands by the elevator, eyes searching the ceiling.
The elevator opens and Doakes exits, holding a key. They
head down the hallway together.
DOAKES
Got an extra key from the manager. He
said the same thing as the front desk
clerk. The guy who checked into 103
is white and normal-looking.
DEBRA
His credit card said Alberto Krasnoff.
How white and normal-looking can he
be?
DOAKES
Probably a stolen credit card.
DEBRA
I haven’t seen a single security
camera since we’ve been here.
DOAKES
It’s likely this guy scouted hotels
and chose one with lax security.
Better be ready to cancel your lunch.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 5.
2 CONTINUED: (3) 2
LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
They reach Room 103 and find a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the
door. Doakes steps forward. KNOCKS HARD. No response.
Doakes KNOCKS HARDER.
DOAKES
Police. Open up.
Still nothing. With a nod, they take out their HANDGUNS.
Doakes uses the extra key to unlock the door. He makes a
move to push inside -- and stops at the threshold. Debra
steps behind him to see what he’s looking at.
DEBRA
Jesus --
Fighting a gag impulse, Debra raises her gun to secure the
crime scene. Doakes grabs his radio.
DOAKES
Metro dispatch. This is 3H88 out at
the Marina View Hotel. Need uniform
backup, forensics...
(looks back inside)
...fuck, just get everyone over here.
Off Debra, rattled, securing the scene...
5 EXT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - SIDE ENTRANCE - LATER 5
A side entrance to the hotel has been sealed off as a crime
scene, with emergency vehicles, UNIFORM COPS and FORENSIC
TECHS. Dexter and MASUKA slip into white-hooded, Level B,
HazMat gear -- aka “bunny suits.”
DEXTER
Been a while since we went
prophylactic.
MASUKA
Not me. Last night I met this chick --
DEXTER
Vince, I’ll stop you right there.
(changing the subject)
So, they tell you anything? You know,
about what’s inside?
MASUKA
Nobody’s been inside. Too much blood.
DEBRA (O.S.)
Dexter!
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 6.
4 CONTINUED: 4
Dexter glances up to see Debra, looking a little shaky,
making her way toward him.
DEBRA
Just a heads up. It’s bad in there.
DEXTER
Okay.
DEBRA
I’m serious.
DEXTER
O-kay.
Doakes walks up.
DOAKES
She’s not kidding. That’s your wet
dream in there.
DEXTER
Okay.
DOAKES
You’re going in first. Alone. Get a
sense of what we’re dealing with and
give me a report. Don’t fuck it up.
As Dexter wonders what could warrant so much concern...
6 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 1 6
The elevator door opens and Dexter, full HazMat suit now,
steps out past TWO COPS standing guard. Dexter trudges
alone down the long hallway toward Room 103, blood kit in
hand.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Now I’m really curious. He’s been
gone so long, he had to be planning a
splashy return. But a crime scene
just for me?
Dexter puts on his face shield and pulls up his hood.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Houston, Tranquility Base here, the
Eagle has landed.
Dexter reaches the closed door to Room 103. He opens the
door and steps into --
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 7.
5 CONTINUED: 5
7 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - ROOM 103 - DAY 1 (CONTINUOUS) 7
A nightmare. BLOOD is streaked and smeared everywhere -- on
the walls, the ceiling. The carpet is a glistening SEA OF
RED. It looks like a massacre happened here, but there are
no bodies in sight.
Dexter barely registers this, before his body stiffens in an
epic anxiety attack. Gasping, his legs go weak and he falls
forward, landing with a splash in the blood. On his hands
and knees, he slips. Can’t stand. Panics. As he lifts his
head, the bloody room DARKENS, and we --
FLASHBACK TO:
8 INT. DARK ENCLOSED SPACE 8
The same THREE-YEAR-OLD from Episode 8 wails, his eyes wide.
Only this time, we WIDEN to reveal that he’s sitting in a
pool of blood. The boy looks around, frightened, no help
coming... just eerie shadows and glistening pools of blood,
shimmering, then fading into black --
SMASH BACK TO:
9 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 1 9
Dexter, on his feet now, stumbles backwards out of Room 103.
His heart pounds and he gasps for breath, his white HazMat
suit streaked in blood.
DEXTER (V.O.)
He’s in my in my head...
Dexter whips off his hood and shield, so he can breathe.
DEXTER (V.O.)
My memory... the boy in the blood...
he recreated it.
Dexter starts wobbling back up the hallway, frantic to get
away from this nightmare.
10 EXT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY 1 10
Doakes and LaGuerta confer near the side entrance. Debra
approaches.
LAGUERTA
Tell me you got something, Morgan.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 8.
DEBRA
I talked to the guests in Room 105.
They didn’t see anyone go in or out.
DOAKES
What about across the hall?
DEBRA
German tourists. Got their heads up
their lederhosen. They heard a
whirring sound but thought someone was
mixing margaritas or -- oh my God.
Over LaGuerta’s shoulder, Debra sees her blood-soaked
brother flounder out of the hotel. She rushes to him.
Dexter sucks in the fresh air like a Hoover upright.
DEBRA
Hey hey. Are you okay?
DEXTER
Just a little queasy. Never should’ve
skipped breakfast. I see now why they
call it the most important meal of the
day.
Debra sees Dexter’s in real distress, takes his arm gently.
DEBRA
Bullshit. You’re shaking. What the
hell happened in there?
DEXTER
I’m okay, I just need a little air.
Doakes and LaGuerta walk up to Dexter.
DOAKES
Crime scene’s inside.
DEBRA
Cut him some slack, all right?
DOAKES
(to Dexter, realizing)
Something finally got to you? Maybe
you’re human after all.
DEXTER
Sorry to disappoint you all, but I
think it’s just low blood sugar.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 9.
10 CONTINUED: 10
LAGUERTA
Just tell us what you saw, Dexter.
How many dead?
DEXTER
(trying to focus)
A lot. But no bodies... just blood.
Fifty, sixty liters... maybe half a
dozen dead... I don’t know.
LAGUERTA
So wait -- you’re saying a mass murder
happened in there but they took the
bodies?
DOAKES
How’s that possible? One elevator.
Emergency stairs with alarms. Someone
would’ve seen corpses coming out.
Masuka lumbers up in his HazMat suit.
MASUKA
Hey bro’, ready to get started?
DEXTER
(honest)
I can’t go back in there.
DEBRA
You don’t have to.
DOAKES
(beat, showing sympathy)
Fine. Just get your bearings and... I
don’t know, work from the hallway.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Back down the rabbit hole.
Debra watches with concern, as Dexter takes a deep breath
and trudges back inside wearing his bunny suit.
11 INT. RITA’S HOTEL - DAY 1 11
Rita hands a BUSINESSMAN a folder with room keys. A long
line of GUESTS stand behind him.
RITA
You’re in 422. Elevator is to the
right. Bobby will see to your bags.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 10.
10 CONTINUED: (2) 10
The businessman heads off. Before the next guest can step
up, TWO SHERIFF’S DETECTIVES approach. One hangs back while
the other walks up to the counter and flashes his badge.
SHERIFF
Dade County Sheriff’s Department. I’m
looking for Rita Bennet?
RITA
That’s me. Did you find Paul?
SHERIFF
(confused)
I’m sorry...?
RITA
(softly)
Paul Bennet? My ex-husband attacked
me last night. My boyfriend filed a
report.
SHERIFF
Only report we have is the one Mr.
Bennet filed.
Now it’s Rita’s turn to be confused.
RITA
Wait -- Paul filed a police report?
For what?
SHERIFF
Assault. Your ex-husband was just
released from Baptist Memorial
Hospital. He’s pressing charges
against you.
RITA
(floored)
But he attacked me.
Across the room, Rita’s MANAGER turns to look. The guests
in line are already curiously watching.
SHERIFF
Not according to him.
RITA
Can we talk about this later?
SHERIFF
I’m afraid we need a formal statement
now. Can you come with us please?
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 11.
11 CONTINUED: 11
Off Rita, trying to hold it together...
12 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - ROOM 103 - DAY 1 12
A FORENSIC TECH in a bunny suit cuts out a SWATCH OF BLOODSOAKED
CARPET and seals it into a bag for later analysis.
Another TECH uses a WET-VAC to suck up excess blood, so a
similarly-attired PHOTOGRAPHER can snap a photo of bloody
FOOTPRINT impressions left under the swatch.
SEVERAL FEET AWAY
A TECH fills a syringe with blood from under a night stand.
He packs the vial into an IGLOO COOLER with dozens of other
vials. Masuka treads by in his bunny suit, giving orders.
MASUKA
Make sure you label the section of the
grid each blood sample came from.
Masuka moves over to the area by the TV and stares at a
blood-drenched wall in fascination. A closer look reveals
the bloody smears are composed of tiny MIST-LIKE DROPS.
MASUKA
You should really get in here, Dex.
I’ve never seen anything like this.
A disembodied voice comes back to him.
DEXTER (O.C.)
Wait ‘til you’ve worked a few more
Colombian drug cases.
MASUKA
I got misting up the walls, across the
ceiling... but no tissue. Come see.
DEXTER (O.C.)
Just get photos. Lots of photos.
PAN THROUGH THE WALL TO --
13 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 1 13
Dexter sits on the floor in his bunny suit, back against the
other side of the wall, deep breathing to keep it together.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Sometimes you can get too close to a
problem. And only distance will bring
the answer into focus.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 12.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
(MORE)
(looks around hallway)
So far the answer’s not in the hall.
Masuka leans outside into the hallway.
MASUKA
And how come the blood isn’t clotting?
DEXTER
The blood’s not clotting?
Masuka shakes his head, no.
DEXTER
A genuine medical mystery. Keep
taking samples, I’ll test it at the
lab.
Dexter’s cell phone RINGS. He stands up, awkwardly tries to
fish it out of his cumbersome bunny suit, nearly dropping it
into the suit’s foot cavity before managing to answer.
DEXTER
Don’t hang up, I’m here... hello?
Hello?
INTERCUT:
14 INT. DADE-COUNTY SHERIFF’S STATION - DAY 1 14
An angry Rita sits on a chair as COPS bustle past.
RITA
Dexter? I’m at the sheriff’s station.
Paul is pressing assault charges
against me. How is that even
possible? I was defending myself.
DEXTER
Just stay calm. I know a lawyer, I’ll
get this straightened out.
RITA
I am calm. They’re the hysterical
ones. They’re charging me with a
class-two felony.
As Dexter listens, he hazards a glance into Room 103.
Instantly, his head starts swimming again.
RITA
Hello? Dexter are you there?
Overwhelmed, Dexter pulls back into the hallway.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 13.
13 CONTINUED: 13
DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
DEXTER
Right here.
RITA
This is ridiculous. How is there no
law against this? I could lose my
job, I could lose my kids...
DEXTER
I won’t let that happen.
RITA
I’m glad you’re so confident, but --
DEXTER
Rita, trust me on this. I know how
the system works. Right now I’m at a
crime scene and I need to go. But
I’ll call my lawyer friend right away.
You okay?
RITA
Yeah yeah, I’m okay. Thanks, Dexter.
Dexter hangs up, then exhales. He calls out to Masuka,
without looking into Room 103.
DEXTER
Vince, check out the wall socket. On
the far wall. Something looks off.
Masuka walks to a section of wall so red it looks PAINTED
WITH BLOOD. He squats and peers closer. REVEAL a VOID OF
BLOOD around the socket.
MASUKA
Hey, you’re right. He had something
plugged in here. Probably a power
tool to cut ‘em up. Come take a look.
DEXTER
Photos, Vince. Lots and lots of
photos.
As Dexter closes his eyes to keep it together...
15 INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE COUNTER - DAY 1 15
BATISTA drops a brick of HEROIN on the evidence counter.
BATISTA
Log it and weep, baby.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 14.
14 CONTINUED: 14
An EVIDENCE ROOM COP slips the heroin into a plastic bag.
EVIDENCE ROOM COP
No cooking equipment?
BATISTA
Just that and a couple extra-crispy
cuerpos were all that was left.
EVIDENCE ROOM COP
Must’a been a hell of an explosion.
The cop slides him a receipt. Batista unzips a SATCHEL to
slip in the receipt. As he stares at something inside,
Masuka enters and sets a COOLER on the evidence counter.
MASUKA
Blood samples for the freezer. And
you better make room. There’s gonna
be a lot more coming.
(to Batista)
Shooters at Bel Canto tonight. You
in?
BATISTA
Not in the mood.
MASUKA
Angel. You’re on the market. And the
Bel Canto is hottie central.
Batista wistfully pulls a pair of Neil Diamond tickets from
the satchel.
BATISTA
Backstage passes to Neil Diamond.
They were for Nina’s birthday.
MASUKA
Forever in Blue Jeans? You’re in
worse shape than I thought.
The evidence room cop slides Masuka a receipt. As Masuka
slaps Batista on the back and they head out together...
16 INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY 1 16
Dexter waits for the elevator. Debra joins his side.
DEXTER
Oh, hi.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 15.
15 CONTINUED: 15
DEBRA
Hi.
DEXTER
Masuka was looking for you. Something
about drinks at the Bel Canto.
DEBRA
I told him I had a yeast infection.
DEXTER
Bit of an over-share.
The elevator DINGS and opens. Dexter and Debra enter --
17 INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - DAY 1 (CONTINUOUS) 17
When the doors close, Debra gingerly broaches the subject.
DEBRA
You want to talk about what happened
today?
DEXTER
Already did.
DEBRA
Dexter. The last time I saw you like
that was when Dad died. You can talk
to me, you know? You just gotta...
open your mouth and move it. I can
call Rudy and tell him I’ll be late.
DEXTER
Deb, seriously. I puked, I’m fine. I
know you want to help, but unless
you’ve got breath mints, there’s
nothing to do.
DEBRA
(miffed)
Why do you always do this?
DEXTER
Do what?
DEBRA
Shut me out. Like your birth father
who lived up the highway your whole
life and never tried to contact you.
I still don’t know how that makes you
feel.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 16.
16 CONTINUED: 16
The elevator stops. The doors open. Two COPS enter. As
the doors close, Dexter turns to Debra and speaks softly.
DEXTER
I’ll tell you what. If some random
emotion strikes me in the middle of
the night, you’ll be my first call.
DEBRA
Fine. Whatever.
Off them riding the rest of the way in silence...
18 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 1 18
Rita, defiant and firm, sits with a sympathetic LAWYER at
the table.
LAWYER
...did Paul force his way into the
house?
RITA
No.
LAWYER
Did you ask him to leave?
RITA
Oh yeah. And he refused.
The lawyer checks the police report.
LAWYER
But in your statement, you invited
your ex-husband... into your bedroom?
RITA
He was drunk. The kids were asleep.
And I knew where things were heading.
Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.
LAWYER
You didn’t want it to escalate, I get
that. But we can’t prove intent and
your ex-husband has the injury here,
not you.
RITA
Paul has a record of spousal abuse.
LAWYER
Spousal abuse can be mutual.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 17.
17 CONTINUED: 17
RITA
It was never mutual.
LAWYER
Okay. But the man’s a model parolee.
His drug tests are clean. Glowing
reports from the court-appointed
supervisor. Corrections will want to
see this guy transition.
Rita finally loses her temper.
RITA
I don’t care! I’m not letting him
near my children. Do you understand?
LAWYER
Rita... if you deny him visitation --
you’ll lose your children. Now you’ve
got a deposition in two days. Do not
give him any more ammunition than he
already has.
Rita looks away angrily. Did she even hear him?
19 INT. DEBRA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 19
Debra and Rudy curl up in bed with glasses of wine.
RUDY
Damn. Just blood? Where’d the bodies
go?
DEBRA
Hell if I know. I don’t even want to
know. The blood was bad enough.
RUDY
No wonder you’re so uptight. Poor
thing. Bet your brother had a field
day though.
DEBRA
(nervous laugh)
Oh. Fuck no. Try freaked.
Rudy perks up, fascinated.
RUDY
Really? I thought, you know, blood
was his thing. What happened?
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 18.
18 CONTINUED: 18
DEBRA
Who knows. Like usual, he shut me
out.
RUDY
Did he say anything?
DEBRA
Can we not talk about Dex right now?
She drains her wine, nuzzles up to Rudy, and starts kissing
his neck. He looks up and moans, pretending to enjoy her
kisses.
RUDY
Was it like a panic attack?
DEBRA
I don’t know. He’s not big on sharing
his feelings, case you hadn’t noticed.
Kiss me...
Rudy kisses Debra back. The kissing becomes more urgent.
Debra slides her hand down Rudy’s pants -- and frowns.
DEBRA
What’s the matter? You don’t even
have wood.
RUDY
(defensive)
You’re the one who said you wanted to
talk.
DEBRA
Yeah, but not now, I’m horny.
She passionately kisses Rudy, grinding her body against his.
Suddenly, Rudy pulls away.
RUDY
Maybe I should call him.
DEBRA
Are you fucking kidding me?
RUDY
What, we bonded last weekend. Isn’t
that what a boyfriend’s supposed to
do? Show some interest in the family.
Debra slides back to her side of the bed.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 19.
19 CONTINUED: 19
DEBRA
Not when his girlfriend’s trying to
get into his pants.
RUDY
Debra, that’s not fair. You take me
on a couples weekend to get to know
your brother, and now you punish me
for giving a damn? Your issues with
him don’t have to be mine.
DEBRA
You know what? Forget it. Let’s just
go to sleep.
Debra rolls over and shuts off her bedside table light.
RUDY
Go right ahead. I’m gonna watch TV.
Rudy gets up and walks out. Off Debra, pissed, even more
pissed because Rudy might be right...
20 INT. HOTEL BEL CANTO - BAR - NIGHT 1 20
CLOSE on a PROSTHETIC HAND resting on a bar, each fingernail
painted a DIFFERENT COLOR. TILT UP to a beautiful lady
escort, MONIQUE, laughing with a distinguished CLIENT.
Behind them, a DJ mixes and the dance floor rocks.
MOVE down the packed bar to FIND Masuka, making time with a
PIERCED CHICK. KEEP MOVING until we LAND on a sad, drunken
Batista, who’s dangling his Neil Diamond passes in front of
a BORED WOMAN like they’re the Holy Grail.
BATISTA
Nina loved Neil Diamond. Song Sung
Blue. September Morn. Oh my God,
Kentucky Woman? You gotta love that
shit.
The Bored Woman tries to get the bartender’s attention.
BATISTA
Nina loved him so goddamn much she
took every one of his CDs in the
separation. Wouldn’t even give me
Greatest Hits.
Batista downs the last of his drink.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 20.
19 CONTINUED: (2) 19
BATISTA
So you wanna go to this concert or
what?
Finally, the Bored Woman just tosses some money on the bar
and hurries away. Batista looks like he could cry. Masuka
approaches with the Pierced Chick in tow.
MASUKA
That’s like the fourth chick you’ve
driven off.
Batista tries to order another drink from the bartender.
Masuka gets the bartender’s attention, shakes his head, no.
MASUKA
This was a mistake.
BATISTA
(slurring)
Que dices? Estoy chido.
MASUKA
Bro’. You’re a train wreck. You
gotta stop talking about the divorce.
BATISTA
I ain’t ashamed.
MASUKA
Yeah that’s clear. But it’s pathetic.
Don’t talk about your divorce unless
they ask. Then you’re just being
honest. Oh, and eighty-six the ring.
PIERCED CHICK
I have to take a squirt.
The Pierced Chick kisses Masuka and stomps off.
MASUKA
She’s gonna fuck me silly.
Batista is lost in his own thoughts.
BATISTA
I really loved her.
MASUKA
I know.
(beat)
We all know.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 21.
20 CONTINUED: 20
A handful of DRINKERS turn and nod, like they’ve heard
enough, too. Masuka pats Batista on the shoulder. It’s
awkward but it’s from a place of genuine friendship.
21 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 21
Dexter lies in bed with Rita. Eyes wide open. Staring at
the ceiling.
DEXTER (V.O.)
My sister’s right. I don’t share my
problems with her. Or with anybody.
Harry taught me that. Secrecy, selfreliance,
and a well-stocked cupboard
of Hefty bags.
He looks at the clock -- it’s 2 AM. Back up to the ceiling.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Fortunately, I’ve never met a problem
I can’t manage. Until that boy in the
blood. He frightens me. I just want
him to go away.
RITA (O.C.)
Dexter, you awake?
DEXTER
(pretends he’s asleep)
Hmmm? Wha...?
Rita rolls over, revealing that she’s awake, too.
RITA
Are you sure you locked the door?
DEXTER
Positive. Bolt and chain.
RITA
Thanks.
There’s a long beat and Dexter sees the fear in her eyes.
RITA
What am I going to do?
DEXTER
Don’t worry. I’ll figure it out.
Rita rolls over and Dexter spoons her.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 22.
20 CONTINUED: (2) 20
DEXTER (V.O.)
And I will. I can always see other
people’s problems more clearly than my
own. Fortunately, Rita’s has a name.
As Dexter imagines killing Paul, he gently closes his eyes
and starts drifting off to sleep...
22 INT. POLICE STATION - DEXTER’S LAB - DAY 2 22
LaGuerta, Doakes, Debra and Masuka hover over Dexter, who
works behind his computer.
ON DEXTER’S COMPUTER MONITOR
A computer-rendered IMAGE of the floor in Room 103. A
confusing pattern of multi-colored FOOTPRINTS.
DEXTER
Everyone who set foot on the bloody
carpet in Room 103 left a footprint.
Since we have shoe molds of all our
personnel, that leaves only one set of
footprints unaccounted for...
One by one, the footprints from police personnel begin to
DISAPPEAR, leaving only one set.
DEXTER
...the killer’s. They show everywhere
he went in the room. Question is why?
LAGUERTA
Hold on. Aren’t we missing something.
Where are the victims’ footprints?
DEXTER
Give the lady a lollipop.
There’s a pregnant pause as everyone digests this news.
DEBRA
Are you suggesting there were never
any bodies in Room 103? Why would a
guy fake a massacre with no bodies?
DOAKES
And where’d he get the blood?
Masuka produces a REPORT.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 23.
21 CONTINUED: 21
MASUKA
I just got a preliminary blood report.
The blood in that room came from at
least five different bodies, possibly
more.
DEXTER (V.O.)
My fellow traveler had five victims.
DEBRA
The Ice Truck Killer had five victims.
LAGUERTA
(catching on)
Five bloodless victims.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I always wondered what he did with the
blood.
They grasp the immensity of what this means. Except Doakes.
DOAKES
Wait, wait. The Ice Truck Killer did
not horde his victims’ blood just to
throw a party at the mother-fucking
Marina View Hotel. Why would he do
that?
DEXTER (V.O.)
To chase me down the rabbit hole.
DOAKES
What was that, Morgan?
DEXTER
(spooked)
I didn’t say anything.
DOAKES
(to the rest)
I’ll remind you people that we already
arrested the Ice Truck Killer. His
name’s Neil Perry and he’s awaiting
trial in county.
LAGUERTA
Bullshit. Perry recanted his
confession. He’s a fraud.
DOAKES
Try telling the Captain that.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 24.
22 CONTINUED: 22
LAGUERTA
I did. And he blew me off.
DEBRA
(to Dexter and Masuka)
Do we have any other evidence to
support this theory?
DEXTER
When Masuka noticed the blood wasn’t
clotting, I ran some tests. It was
loaded with Coumadin and Heparin.
MASUKA
One’s an anti-coagulant, the other’s a
preservative. Means the blood’s old.
Dexter hands them crime scene photos of the bloody walls.
DEXTER
Plus, the blood spatter was all impact
and cast-off. No hand transfers or
swipe patterns to indicate the
presence of actual victims.
DOAKES
If this is the Ice Truck Killer, it’s
gonna be another giant shit-stain for
the department.
LAGUERTA
That’s why this stays between us until
I say otherwise.
LaGuerta hesitates, but we can see her wheels turning.
LAGUERTA
Masuka. Run the DNA on all five vics
and see if it matches the Ice Truck
Killer’s victims.
(to Doakes and Debra)
You two get out to the Marina View.
Retrace his footprints. Maybe his
movements will tell us something.
(then)
And remember, low profile. Not a word
about the Ice Truck Killer to anyone.
Off her conviction...

23 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 2 23
Cody and Astor wait by the front door. Rita fusses with
Astor’s clothes. She’s agitated, feigning calm.
RITA
Stand up straight, Astor. Do you have
your emergency phone number list?
ASTOR
It’s in my backpack. Do I have to
show it to you again?
RITA
No. Just promise me you won’t let
your brother out of your sight.
DEXTER
Rita...
RITA
And you remember what you do if you
get lost?
Dexter pulls Rita aside, out of the children’s earshot.
DEXTER
You’re scaring them.
RITA
They should be scared. I didn’t tell
them what Paul did the other night.
DEXTER
What did you say when you dragged them
to the neighbors?
RITA
I said I smelled gas.
(then)
I should’ve just piled them in the car
and left the state. Went home to
Michigan. It would’ve been so easy.
DEXTER
Remember what the lawyer said. You
don’t want to do anything rash.
There’s a KNOCK at the door.
DEXTER
Now just relax. The court supervisor
will be there the entire time.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 26.
Dexter opens the door, revealing PAUL, with a BANDAGE on his
head, and the COURT SUPERVISOR. Cody instantly rushes over.
CODY
Daddy, what happened?
PAUL
Nothing, little man. Just a small
bump. C’mon kids, pile in. Circus
Vargas awaits. I told you, Daddy
always keeps his promises.
Paul herds the kids outside. Rita nervously watches them
through the window, as Dexter watches Rita with concern.
24 INT. DEXTER’S CAR - DRIVING (MIAMI FOOTAGE) - DAY 2 24
Dexter drives through the city.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I prefer the enchanting Rita over the
worried one. If I can figure out a
way to make her ex-husband my problem,
I could help her sleep much easier
tonight.
25 EXT. MOTOR COURT LODGE - DAY 2 25
Dexter parks and walks through the parking lot. He skirts a
couple ratty lawn chairs beside a plastic footstool, with an
overflowing ashtray and empty beer cans.
DEXTER (V.O.)
All I need is a little proof of his
inner monster. Harry would have
insisted on that.
As Dexter approaches Paul’s room, he hears INFANT CRIES from
one of the units. Dexter ignores the “DO NOT DISTURB” sign
on the door, makes sure no one is watching, then picks the
lock.
26 INT. MOTOR COURT LODGE - PAUL’S ROOM - DAY 2 26
Dexter enters to snoop, reacting again to an INFANT CRYING,
which is louder now. He sees PHOTOS of Cody and Astor on a
bedside table. Dexter pulls open the drawer underneath and
finds a HANDGUN, some BULLETS, and a BAG OF WEED.
DEXTER (V.O.)
The trifecta -- weapon, ammo and
impaired judgment.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 27.
23 CONTINUED: 23
(MORE)
Throw in a little domestic violence,
and you have the perfect recipe for a
family slaughter.
Dexter hooks a finger into the gun, picks it up, and checks
the muzzle to see if it’s been fired recently.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Harry didn’t believe in preemptive
killing. But maybe I can bend the
rules just this once. After all,
Harry wasn’t perfect. He lied about
my birth father.
As Dexter puts down the gun, the INFANT’S CRIES grow louder.
DEXTER (V.O.)
(distracted)
Would somebody get that kid a bottle?
Without warning, Dexter is seized by another memory, as the
infant’s cries next door transform into --
FLASHBACK TO:
27 INT. DARK ENCLOSED SPACE 27
The same THREE-YEAR-OLD wails inconsolably, sitting in a sea
of blood. But this time the memory goes further. PAN TO a
fallen MAN -- or part of a man -- it’s hard to tell. He
lies face down in the thick liquid. A WOMAN’S VOICE rings
out from the blackness --
WOMAN’S VOICE
Honey, don’t cry. Please don’t cry...
SMASH BACK TO:
28 EXT. MOTOR COURT LODGE - DAY 2 (CONTINUOUS) 28
The door to Paul’s room bursts open and Dexter stumbles out,
freaked, panting, soaked in sweat. He fights for breath,
looking around desperately. What the hell is happening?
29 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - ROOM 103 - DAY 2 29
WOOD PLANKS lay a foot above the ground on a SCAFFOLDING
system. The blood has congealed and dried. Square patches
of carpet are missing. Doakes and Debra walk the planks,
using Dexter’s MAP to retrace the killer’s footsteps.
DOAKES
So after he soaked the room in blood,
he walked to the desk...
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 28.
26 CONTINUED: 26
DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
They pass a blood-spattered desk with a lamp and a Bible.
DOAKES
And then the bedside table. Why?
Debra looks over the bedside table, where they stand now.
DEBRA
There’s a clock radio. Some smeared
blood here. Maybe he turned it on.
She turns on the radio. A POP SONG plays.
DOAKES
We’re missing something. Let’s go
over it again.
DEBRA
We’ve been over it three times.
DOAKES
Maybe the map is wrong. Call your
brother.
Debra GROANS.
DOAKES
What?
DEBRA
Why is everyone’s first move calling
Dexter? You don’t even like Dexter.
DOAKES
All right, I’ll bite. What did the
freak do now -- boil your goldfish?
DEBRA
No, it’s not... it’s Rudy. We had our
first fight, tiff, I dunno, whatever
you wanna call it.
DOAKES
(confused)
I thought we were talking about
Dexter?
DEBRA
We were...
(realizing)
Oh, shit.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 29.
29 CONTINUED: 29
Debra realizes that she did take her problem with Dexter out
on Rudy.
DOAKES
What?
DEBRA
Nothing.
Doakes looks thoroughly baffled. In the b.g., the song ends
and a DJ comes on the radio.
DJ’S VOICE
...and we’ll be back with Billy Idol,
The Eurythmics and Devo on 103 FM,
hits from the eighties...
Doakes switches off the clock radio.
DEBRA
Wait! I wanna hear that!
DOAKES
It’s Devo.
DEBRA
No, he said 103 FM.
DOAKES
Yeah, so?
DEBRA
This room is 103.
Doakes walks to the desk. Sees a page marker in the Bible.
Flips it open...to LEVITICUS 10:3.
DOAKES
Leviticus 10:3. Son of a bitch.
DEBRA
Think he’s trying to tell us
something?
DOAKES
(reading Bible)
“I will be sanctified in them that
come nigh me, and before all the
people I will be glorified.”
Off Debra and Doakes, mystified...

30 EXT. DEXTER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 2 30
Dark. Forboding. The moon hides in the black sky. Dexter
trudges along his exterior balcony, rattled from his latest
memory. He freezes at the sight of a SHADOWED FIGURE
outside his door. The person steps into the light. It’s
Rudy waiting with a brown paper bag in hand.
RUDY
Hey.
DEXTER
Hey.
RUDY
Deb’s pissed at me. I need advice.
DEXTER
So you came here?
RUDY
You know her better than anyone.
C’mon, I got two porterhouses and a
sixer of microbrew.
Rudy holds up the bag. Off Dexter, without an excuse...
31 INT. DEXTER’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT 2 31
Two porterhouse steaks sizzle in a pan. Rudy, holding a
beer, rummages through drawers, searching through various
sharp utensils. Dexter painfully watches.
RUDY
Well... one minute we’re talking about
her day, y’know that whole bloodbath
thing.
DEXTER
Right, right.
Rudy slams closed one drawer and opens another to search.
RUDY
The next, she wants to jump my bones.
I mean, Deb’s hot and all but sprinkle
in some conversation once in awhile,
y’know?
DEXTER
I don’t know. She’s my sister.
(then)
Can I help you find something?
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 31.
RUDY
You wouldn’t happen to have a good
meat knife?
Dexter opens a drawer, pulls out a MEAT KNIFE, and hands it
to Rudy. As he talks, Rudy casually waves the knife for
emphasis.
RUDY
Anyway, the other part of the argument
was about you.
DEXTER
Me?
RUDY
Yeah, it was already tense, but when I
brought your name up, she lost it.
Dexter considers this for a moment.
DEXTER
Deb doesn’t like to feel left out.
It’s kinda her issue.
RUDY
So what do I do?
DEXTER
Tell her it was all your fault.
RUDY
Seriously?
DEXTER
You will eventually. Deb has a way of
wearing you down. So just start from
that place. It saves time.
Rudy’s cell phone RINGS. He looks at the caller ID.
RUDY
Sorry, gotta take this.
Rudy puts down the knife and steps outside to take the call.
32 EXT. DEXTER’S APARTMENT - TERRACE - NIGHT 2 (CONTINUOUS) 32

Debra sits behind her desk, glumly going over files.
DEBRA

RUDY
Lemme guess. The bloodbath case?
DEBRA
Let’s not talk shop, okay?
(beat)
Baby, I’m so sorry. You were totally
right. I was mad at Dexter and took
it all out on you. My shift’s almost
done. Can you come over and talk?
RUDY
I’d love to, Babe, but I’m about to
eat dinner with Dexter.
There’s an uncomfortable pause, as Debra bites her tongue.
DEBRA
Well, then after. I’ll wait up.
RUDY
That’s the thing. I was going to
sleep at my place tonight.
(off her silence)
It’s closer and I’m drinking. You
understand, right?
DEBRA
(covering)
Sure, okay.
RUDY
I’ll give you a call tomorrow.
Rudy turns off his cell and heads back inside.
RUDY
So how those steaks comin’?

34 INT. HOTEL BEL CANTO - BAR - NIGHT 2 34
The DJ plays slow and seductive music. Batista sits alone,
dressed in a crisp suit and tie. He spots a SEXY WOMAN and
they exchange a glance. He takes a deep breath, pockets his
WEDDING RING, and approaches her.
BATISTA
Care to dance?
SEXY WOMAN
You salsa?
BATISTA
A bit.
The Sexy Woman sizes him up.
SEXY WOMAN
What about your wife?
(explains)
Tan line. On your ring finger.
BATISTA
Well... um, actually I’m --
(beat)
I’m not gonna talk about that tonight.
SEXY WOMAN
Divorced, I get it. Mine was just
finalized. Let’s not talk about it
together on the dance floor.
Batista smiles, takes her hand, and leads her onto the --
DANCE FLOOR
Where Batista starts out cold, his nervous energy making
their chemistry awkward. But as the music builds, he
becomes smoother, more expert, and soon he’s twirling her
around the room effortlessly, smiling ear to ear.
The Sexy Woman can’t believe it. Who’s this guy? She gasps
as the moves become more intricate. Batista literally
sweeps her off her feet and into a dramatic clench. A kiss
seems imminent, until --
OVER THE SEXY WOMAN’S SHOULDER
Batista spots an OLDER GUY dancing with the beautiful woman,
MONIQUE, who we established earlier. Something seems off.
It’s her hand on the shoulder of her date. He peers closer
and sees that Monique has a --
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 34.
PROSTHETIC HAND
The fingernails SPARKLING in different colors.
BATISTA
(to the Sexy Woman)
Excuse me.
He steps over to the other couple, flashes his badge.
BATISTA
Police officer. I need to --
They instantly separate.
MONIQUE
I’m not a hooker. I work for a
legitimate escort service now.
BATISTA
Whoa, whoa... I’m not here to bust
anyone. I just need to know why you
paint your nails like that.
(turns to the Sexy Woman)
One sec’, honey.
She smiles but seems a bit put off. As Batista pulls
Monique aside, the Older Guy with her slips away.
MONIQUE
Thanks. That was a major client.
BATISTA
Hey. You wanna spend the night in a
holding cell?
MONIQUE
(weighs her options)
About a year ago, there was this
guy...
BATISTA
Guy or client?
MONIQUE
A john, okay? Back then I worked
Calle Ocho. Anyway, he was getting
kind’a rough until he saw this --
She flashes her prosthetic.
BATISTA
Then what?
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 35.
34 CONTINUED: 34
MONIQUE
Then he changed his tune. Got all
turned on. Told me to take off the
fake hand. He started doing all this
weird kinky shit with my arm, like he
was worshipping it. To cap it off, he
takes all my polish and paints each
nail a different color. Looked pretty
good, so I kept doing it.
BATISTA
You watch the news?
MONIQUE
A little.
BATISTA
The guy they arrested for the Ice
Truck killings. Was it the same guy?
MONIQUE
The one who stuffs road kill? No way.
This trick was sexy. A freak, but
sexy.
Batista can’t believe he might have just stumbled onto a
major lead. Batista looks over. The Sexy Woman he was
dancing with has left. Batista sighs.
BATISTA
All right. From the beginning. But
this time with more detail.
As Batista takes out a pad and pen...

She tickles him, but he won’t respond. Rita turns to Astor.

Rita bites her tongue. She wants to scream, she’s so mad.
ASTOR
It’s okay, Mommy. I know you’re not

me.
Astor smiles and snuggles under the covers. Off Rita, just
devastated...
36 EXT. DEXTER’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT 2 36
Several hours and beers later, Dexter and Rudy say goodbye.
RUDY
Thanks for the hospitality.
DEXTER
Thanks for the steaks.
Rudy sticks out his hand. As Dexter awkwardly shakes --
RUDY
Hey, I never even got a chance to ask.
Debra mentioned that you had a little
incident at the crime scene.
DEXTER
Did she?
RUDY
Most of my prosthetics clients are
pretty traumatized by the time they
get to me. Anyway, I’m a good
listener. If you ever need to talk.
Feeling oddly comfortable, Dexter speaks before he thinks.
DEXTER
Thanks, but unless you know an expert
in repressed memories...
Rudy stares at him.

You know something about it?
RUDY
More than I ever want to.

When I was in high school I started
having these dreams of a woman hit by
a truck.
DEXTER
Who was she?
RUDY
No idea. Till one day I stopped by a
mail box -- and it all came crashing
back. My Mom... getting out to mail a
letter... me in the car. I watched
her die.
DEXTER
How old were you?
RUDY
Four. But I didn’t remember it till I
mailed a letter. Walked right into
the belly of the beast without
knowing.
(then)
So, what kind of memories you having?
DEXTER
They’re still a little vague.
RUDY
Right. Well, you gotta face ‘em
eventually. Maybe next time.
Dexter appreciates the advice -- and Rudy not prying.
DEXTER
When you talk to Deb, go with white
roses. They’re her favorite.
RUDY
Good tip.

Funny how life brings people together,

clearing beer bottles.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Rudy misunderstands my problem. I
want the boy in blood to go away, not
come crashing back. Fortunately, I
have other people’s problems to focus
on right now.

Dexter grabs Rudy’s CELL PHONE and runs outside --

LaGuerta briefs CAPTAIN MATTHEWS.
LAGUERTA
So far we’re chasing a ghost.
LaGuerta shows Matthews a POLICE SKETCH -- white male, dark
hair, regular features, sun glasses. It could be Rudy. It
could be anybody.
LAGUERTA
Couple hotel employees helped with a
sketch, but it’s pretty generic. Only
real lead we have is a set of numbers
at the crime scene.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Screw the numbers. Who was killed?
Where are the bodies? I heard some
wild theories out there.
LAGUERTA
Just theories. We’re still waiting on
full blood results.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Dammit Maria, you’re stalling. Why?
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 39.
36 CONTINUED: (2) 36
LAGUERTA
I’m just trying to avoid speculation.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Well you gotta give me something soon.
This department can’t afford another
public relations disaster.
LaGuerta sees her opportunity. She takes a chance.
LAGUERTA
Then tell the D.A. to let Neil Perry
go. He’s not the Ice Truck Killer.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
(surprised)
Are you still hung up on... Jesus,
Maria. That’s not going to happen.
LAGUERTA
The D.A. takes his cues from us. If
you just tell him you made a mistake --
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Not going to happen. Now let it go.
Matthews heads to the door, then stops and turns back.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
First break in this case, you come
straight to me.
Matthews exits. LaGuerta, holding an ace up her sleeve,
calmly returns to the work on her desk.

This may be a total shot in the dark,

MASUKA
Goin’ with the pro. Now that’s how
you get over the ex.
BATISTA
No, that’s not what I mean.
MASUKA
Okay, so you didn’t fuck her. She
blew you though, right?

Would you shut up. It was a lead.
MASUKA
On what?
BATISTA
I’ll let you know if it pans out. But
first, I need to know what you can
tell me about amputee fetishes.
MASUKA
It’s called acrotomophilia. But don’t
let any of them hear you call it that.
Sounds like a disease. They prefer to
be known as devotees.
Batista jots it down in his pad.
BATISTA
I knew you were the man to ask.
MASUKA
Not really. I prefer a girl with a
Kung Fu grip. Who you should talk to
is what’s-his-face, Deb’s boyfriend.
Prosthetics guys deal with devotees
all the time.

coveralls and clear goggles. He dips a TILE SAW into a tray
of RED PAINT and lets the blade rip, spraying the walls and
ceiling with red.
After a beat, Dexter stops the blade, removes the goggles,
and looks around. The walls are covered by rolls of white
paper, with red spatter remarkably similar to Room 103.
DEXTER (V.O.)
No memory flashes here. No little
lost boy in blood. Maybe he went back
to hiding in the dormant reaches of my
cerebral cortex. Here’s to hoping.
RUDY
Dex!... YO’, DEX!...
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 41.
40 CONTINUED: 40
Dexter wheels around startled. It’s a UNIFORM COP letting
Rudy inside. Rudy looks around.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 41A.
41 CONTINUED: 41
RUDY
So this is what you do for a living?
Dexter sets down the tile saw beside a DRUM of THEATRICAL
BLOOD. The Uniform Cop leaves.
DEXTER
I’m trying to match cast-off patterns
from a crime scene. A power tool was
involved.
Dexter pulls off a glove, reaches into his pocket, and hands
Rudy his cell phone.
RUDY
Thanks.
Rudy looks at the tile saw curiously. Several other
disturbing and lethal SAWS are nearby on a table.
RUDY
A tile saw? Seems like there’d be
easier ways to make a mess like this.
DEXTER
Trust me, there are. I’ve been here
for hours.
RUDY
You know, my line of work you hear all
the horror stories. Boat propellers,
garbage disposals... this seems like
something you’d see with a chainsaw.
DEXTER
I hear that. Problem is, this power
tool was plugged into a socket.
RUDY
Guess you never used an electric
chainsaw.
Off an intrigued Dexter, who clearly hasn’t...
42 INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 3 42
Doakes holds a briefing with a crowd of uniforms and
detectives, including Debra.
DOAKES
...we’re coming up empty, people.
Those numbers mean something. One.
Zero. Three.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 42.
41 CONTINUED: (2) 41
(MORE)
We need to find the connection and
until we do, you’re going to go over
every page of every police report you
wrote in the last six months.
A GROAN goes through the bullpen. Debra sighs, then sees --
THROUGH THE GLASS INTO THE HALLWAY
Dexter walks Rudy toward the elevator, laughing and joking.
Her jaw tightens in anger.
DOAKES
That’s right, that’s right. I need
you to burn those numbers in your
brain and get moving...
43 INT. POLICE STATION - DEMO ROOM - DAY 3 43
Dexter returns from walking Rudy out. He enters his lab to
find Debra waiting for him, more than a little pissed off.
DEBRA
How do you always do it?
DEXTER
(perplexed)
Do what?
Dexter begins cleaning up the area.
DEBRA
Make me feel like I’m six years old.
All the time.
DEXTER
Is this about Rudy? Because, he was
just picking up his cell phone.
DEBRA
Oh yeah? And where’d he leave it?
DEXTER
At my apartment.
DEBRA
What was he doing there?
DEXTER
Eating steaks?
DEBRA
And?
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 43.
42 CONTINUED: 42
DOAKES (CONT'D)
Dexter stops picking up, knows he’s in an argument now.
DEXTER
I don’t know. Drinking beer.
DEBRA
And?
DEXTER
Debra --
DEBRA
And?
DEXTER
Talking?
DEBRA
Talking! You talked. Your mouth
moved and sounds came out. On the
same night that I wanted to talk to
you -- but you shut me out.
DEXTER
(getting it, finally)
Oh.
DEBRA
Yeah. “Oh.” You don’t talk to me,
Dex. You’ve spent our entire lives
keeping me at a distance. Even after
you practically pass out at a crime
scene. But my boyfriend shows up on
your doorstep with a couple T-bones --
DEXTER
They were porterhouses.
DEBRA
Porterhouses -- and you’re suddenly
tossing back beers into the middle of
the night.
Dexter stops arguing. He sees that Debra is really upset.
DEBRA
You’re the only family I have and I
barely know you. So y’know, if you’re
gonna eat “porterhouses” with somebody
after a tough day, if somebody’s gonna
break through your fucking walls, Dex.
I think it should be me. I think I’ve
earned it.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 44.
43 CONTINUED: 43
Debra fights back her tears. The ball is clearly in
Dexter’s court. He glances at the clock on the wall.
DEXTER
I’m late to Rita’s deposition.
Debra is too hurt to even respond.
DEXTER
Deb, it’s hard for me, you know that.
Debra has heard it all before. But this time, it’s just not
good enough. She simply shakes her head and walks out. Off
Dexter, realizing this won’t be an easy solve...
44 INT. LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 3 44
CLOSE on a FEMALE PROSECUTOR in the middle of a deposition.
FEMALE PROSECUTOR
Last question. According to your exhusband,
you left town with your
boyfriend last weekend.
REVEAL Rita and Lawyer sitting in a conference room.
RITA
That’s right. His father died.
As she glances over, PAN to Dexter sitting beside Rita for
support. Dexter smiles bravely for effect.
FEMALE PROSECUTOR
Did your ex-husband have a scheduled
visitation with his children during
that time?
RITA
I told Paul I’d make it up to him.
FEMALE PROSECUTOR
So then he gave you permission?
RITA
No, but... I’m the one who gave Paul
visitation in the first place. I’m
the custodial parent. I didn’t have
to do that.
LAWYER
Can we have a second?
(pulls Rita aside)
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 45.
43 CONTINUED: (2) 43
(MORE)
Why didn’t you tell me you broke your
visitation agreement?
RITA
I didn’t know it was a big deal.
His reproachful look tells her it is a very big deal. He
turns to the prosecutor.
LAWYER
I think she’s answered that question,
so unless there’s something else.
The Female Prosecutor starts packing up.
FEMALE PROSECUTOR
That’s fine. If I missed anything,
we’ll get to it at the psychiatric
evaluation next Wednesday.
The prosecutor exits. Worried, Rita turns to her lawyer.
RITA
What? I wasn’t told anything about a
psychiatric evaluation.
LAWYER
It’s mandatory in these cases. The
psyche test determines if there’s a
competency hearing.
RITA
(outraged)
For me? He’s the ex-con.
LAWYER
It’s standard. You should be fine.
DEXTER
“Should be?” Is there a chance she
could actually lose this?
LAWYER
(straight with them)
Guys, I’m handcuffed here. You
violated a custody agreement. You
struck your ex-husband inside your
bedroom. He’s got a case. Now, in
order to proceed, I’m afraid I need
some kind of retainer.
A besieged Rita turns to Dexter. Help!

45 INT. RUDY’S PROSTHETICS LAB - DAY 3 45
Rudy works on an artificial foot. Surrounded by prosthetic
tools, partial limbs and paraphernalia. Batista steps
through the open door and extends his hand.
BATISTA
You Rudy Cooper? Angel Batista. I
work with your girlfriend, Deb.
RUDY
(shakes)
Oh hey. Nice to meet you.
BATISTA
I’d like to ask you a few questions,
if you don’t mind.
RUDY
Sure. Let me just shut the door.
Rudy walks to the door, covertly glances down the hall to
see if anyone saw Batista enter, then closes the door.
RUDY
Would this be related to a case?
BATISTA
You could say that.
RUDY
Wow. Okay, so fire away.
Rudy casually returns to his work on the artificial foot,
his back to Batista.
BATISTA
I ran into this lady with a prosthetic
hand, a call-girl actually. Said she
had a very unique client... an amputee
devotee.
As Batista talks, Rudy’s hand finds a heavy METAL ROD among
the junk on his work counter. He slowly wraps his fingers
around the metal, ready to strike.
RUDY
You have a lead on this client?
BATISTA
That’s the bitch of it. Not a goddamn
clue. Except the freaky sex stuff.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 47.
(MORE)
I thought you might be able to steer
me toward some of those weirdos.
Relieved, Rudy releases his grip on the metal rod. He turns
to Batista and smiles, warm and gracious as can be.
RUDY
Afraid I got into this business to
help people get better. Not help ‘em
get off.
BATISTA
I’m sure Debra will be glad to hear
that.
RUDY
But I’d be happy to talk to a few
colleagues, come up with a contact
list for you.
BATISTA
Oh, that’d be great.
RUDY
Hey, how often you get a chance to
help catch a bad guy, right?
(feeling him out)
You in a rush for this information?
BATISTA
No no, I’m good. I’m chasing a long
shot really. Just give me a call at
the station when you got something.
Batista hands Rudy a BUSINESS CARD.
RUDY
Will do.
Batista glances around in genuine wonder at the menagerie of
prosthetics gear and walks out. When he’s gone, Rudy opens
a drawer -- revealing bottles of multi-colored FINGERNAIL
POLISH -- drops the card inside, and closes the drawer.
46 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - NIGHT 3 46
CLOSE on the front door. It bursts open and Astor charges
into the house, followed by Paul, with a sleepy Cody in his
arms, and the Court Supervisor. Rita joins them from the
kitchen area. Dexter watches from the sink.
ASTOR
Mommy, look at my Henna tattoo!
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 48.
45 CONTINUED: 45
BATISTA (CONT'D)
RITA
Wow.
(concerned)
How much candy have you had?
ASTOR
Lots!
She bolts off to the bedroom. Rita turns to Paul.
RITA
Thanks. She’ll never get to bed now.
PAUL
She’ll come down soon. This one
already crashed.
CODY
(from Paul’s arms)
Mom? Can my Dad read me a story
tonight?
RITA
I don’t think so, honey.
CODY
Please?
Rita glances at the Court Supervisor, watching intently. Is
Rita being judged right now? She has no idea how it works.
RITA
Okay. One story. But pajamas on and
brush teeth first.
PAUL
Get your duds on, bud. The Spiderman
ones I bought you.
COURT SUPERVISOR
(to Paul)
I’ll get him ready. You’ve still got
twenty minutes.
Paul sets Cody down and he sleepily trudges to his bedroom,
followed by the Court Supervisor. Rita notes the exchange.
Paul pulls Rita aside.
PAUL
It doesn’t have to be this way, Rita.
We can make it easy on each other.
I’m willing to drop the charges. If
you agree to unsupervised visitation.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 49.
46 CONTINUED: 46
RITA
Fuck you.
Rita heads into the bedroom. Paul shakes his head. Women.
Spotting Dexter in the kitchen, Paul meanders over.

IN THE KITCHEN
Dexter dries dishes at the counter. Paul walks up.
PAUL
Y’know, Dexy, I don’t believe your
girlfriend appreciates the gravity of
her situation. If she loses this
case, she could lose the kids.
DEXTER
That won’t happen.
PAUL
Never say won’t. We live in a world
full of wills. Wills and wonders,
that’s what I’m teaching my children.
They are my children, too. Something
Rita seems to forget.
Dexter just stands there slowly drying. He unconsciously
snaps the stem of a wine glass in the towel.
PAUL
Okay, I’ll be the first to admit, I’ve
made some mistakes. But I’ve learned
from them. Hey, I’m sober...
(holds out a forearm)
No needle marks. I got the fucking
Alaskan pipeline running through these
veins. All thanks to those two little
glow sticks of love in the other room.
My heart beats for those kids...
(leans in menacingly)
And if you or that skinny bitch try to
screw with what’s mine... I swear to
God, I don’t care who I have to hurt --
Without warning, Dexter rears back and drives his elbow into
Paul’s BANDAGED HEAD WOUND. It’s a savage blow Paul didn’t
see coming, and he drops like a brick. Dexter stares down.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Harry’s first rule was don’t get
emotionally involved. I think this is
why.
RITA (O.C.)
Astor, brush your teeth, now!
The voice snaps Dexter out of it. Dexter thinks quick,
turns and sees the back door...

47 EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 3 47
Dexter runs across the grass, with Paul hoisted over his
shoulder. He labors under Paul’s weight.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Someone once said it’s easier dealing
with other people’s problems than your
own. They were wrong.
48 EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 3 48
In a SERIES OF CUTS, Dexter fishes Paul’s car keys from his
pocket, pops Paul’s trunk, and dumps Paul inside. Climbing
into the car, he puts the gear in neutral and lets it roll
into the street. Next, Dexter starts the engine and
screeches around the corner.
49 EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 3 49
Dexter runs back the opposite way across the yard.
50 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 3 50
Rita looks around the kitchen.
RITA
(calling)
Paul? Dexter?
The back door opens and Dexter enters, carrying the empty
kitchen garbage can. If he’s a little sweaty and out of
breath, Rita doesn’t notice.
RITA
Where were you?
DEXTER
Taking out the trash.
RITA
Did you see Paul?
DEXTER
When I was in the side yard, I thought
I heard the front door open.
Dexter looks down at the kitchen floor and spots a DROP OF
BLOOD. Uh oh. From the living room, Cody looks out the
window.
CODY
Hey, my Dad’s car is gone!
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 51.
Rita heads to the living room. Dexter quickly slips his
foot out of his shoe and sops up the offending blood with
his sock. In the living room, Rita stares out the window.
RITA
Well where did he go?
51 INT. MOTOR COURT LODGE - PAUL’S ROOM - NIGHT 3 51
REVEAL Paul lying unconscious on a white sheet, naked from
the waist up, arms restrained by his side. TILT UP to find
Dexter staring down, savagely contemplating him.
DEXTER
Let’s face it, Paul. You are a
problem.
For a moment Dexter considers the fun he could have with
Paul. He slips on latex gloves. Is he going for a saw...?
DEXTER
And like most problems, you need to go
away...
Dexter adjusts a bedside lamp for light, then reaches into a
satchel of killing saws and knives and pulls out a SYRINGE.
He taps syringe and clears the air bubbles.
DEXTER
Permanently.
As Dexter leans over Paul with the syringe...

Doakes and Batista -- cluster around a TV monitor.

LaGuerta talks to reporters in front of the station.
LAGUERTA
...the Ice Truck Killer case has been
re-opened. Officially. We have new
forensic evidence that shows the DNA

Hotel matches DNA from his victims.

BATISTA
Shit. I hope she told the Captain.
BACK ON TELEVISION
A reporter calls out a question.
REPORTER
What about Neil Perry? Wasn’t he
supposed to be the Ice Truck Killer?
LAGUERTA
Those questions should be directed to
Captain Matthews. He’s been
personally handling the Perry case.
BACK IN THE BULLPEN
More buzzing. A steely voice cuts through the chatter --
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS (O.S.)
Who knew?
REVEAL Captain Matthews standing behind the detectives now,
watching the news on the TV screen.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Who knew about this?
DOAKES
This is the first we’re hearing about
it, Captain.
Everyone in the room quiets. Tries to avoid the Captain’s
withering stare. Off Matthews, doing a slow burn...
55 INT. POLICE STATION - LAGUERTA’S OFFICE - DAY 4 (MORNING) 55
LaGuerta sits at her desk, quietly filling out paperwork.
Captain Matthews enters and closes the door. For a moment,
the two just stare at each other. Matthews stays calm.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Maria, you overplayed your hand.
LAGUERTA
I gave you a chance to make this
right. I told you --
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
You. Don’t tell me. Shit. This is
my department. I made you lieutenant.

CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Oh, I got colors you’ve never seen in
any Crayola box, Maria. But you’re
about to.
(scary calm smile)
Enjoy this office. While it’s still
yours.
Matthews turns and exits. Off LaGuerta, suddenly unsure of
what she just unleashed...
56 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 4 56
Dexter sets down dinner plates around the table. He warily
keeps his eye on the front door.
DEXTER’S POV
Rita talks with her Lawyer in the foyer. After a beat, the
Lawyer smiles, shakes her hand and exits. Rita closes the
door then slumps against it, sobbing.
Dexter approaches worried.
DEXTER
What happened? What’s wrong?
For a beat, Rita can’t find the words.
RITA
It’s Paul...
And then, her tears turn into a weird, wonderful laughter.
RITA
I don’t know all the details, but he
violated Florida’s Three Strike Law.
He’s back in jail.
Astor and Cody run out from their room, drawn by the noise.
CODY
What’s so funny, Mom?
ASTOR
Yeah, why are you laughing?

RITA
I don’t know. I’m just so... get over

She pulls her children into a tightly wound ball of hugs.
DEXTER (V.O.)
It is truly amazing, the things you
can do when you put your mind to it.
No problem is insurmountable.
Off Dexter, watching proudly...
FLASHBACK TO:
A57 INT. MOTOR COURT LODGE - PAUL’S ROOM - NIGHT 3 A57
Paul lies on the bed, looking stoned. His arm is TIED OFF.
A SYRINGE OF HEROIN hangs from his vein. A GUN, a BAG OF
HEROIN, RUBBER TUBING, a BLACKENED SPOON, and a LIGHTER
TORCH are sprawled on a bedside table. There’s a POUNDING
on the door.
COP’S VOICE
Police! Open up!
Paul stirs awake, blurry, incoherent. The TV BLARES and RED
POLICE LIGHTS flash through the curtained window.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Paul did need to go away. But death
wasn’t the answer. Life in prison
will do just fine, thanks to Batista’s
heroin bust. For now at least, the
Code of Harry remains unbroken.
Paul looks around in confusion, his mind still mired in a
heroin fog. The silhouettes of two cops are at the door...
RESUME:
B57 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 4 B57

RITA
C’mere you. You’re part of this

57 INT. BATISTA’S APARTMENT - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 4 57
Batista pulls into his parking space and gets out. He opens
the back seat and grabs a couple bags of groceries. As he
stands, Batista sees a reflection in the glass behind him --
REVEAL
An eerie FIGURE -- face hidden by a flesh-toned stocking and
cap over his head -- raises a WICKED KNIFE to cut Batista’s
throat.
With no time to think, Batista instinctively THRUSTS his
head backward into the face of his attacker, knocking him
off balance -- but not before the attacker DRIVES his knife
deep into the side of Batista, who drops his groceries.
The attacker falls into an SUV, setting off the CAR ALARM.
Batista, bleeding heavily and collapsing, fumbles for his gun.
TWO YOUNG MEN
Horsing around and laughing, emerge from a stairwell and see
the attacker climbing to his feet and reaching for a knife.
THE ATTACKER
Blood soaks through the stocking, where Batista head-butted
his mouth. The attacker sees the young men running his way.
He needs to finish the job with Batista, but realizes he
doesn’t have time. With no options, he takes off running.
As the two young men reach Batista, who lies on the ground
in a fast-spreading pool of blood...
58 INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT 4 58
Debra and Doakes gather their things to head out.
DEBRA
I heard they’re dropping the Ice Truck
murder charges on Neil Perry.
DOAKES
Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be filing a law
suit any minute. More shit for us to
deal with.
DEBRA
Speaking of which, look out for the
reporters on your way out. They’re
still waiting for a comment from the
Captain.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 56.
Doakes glances over at the way the shadow hits her face in
the darkened bullpen. Beautiful.
DOAKES
So... things still rocky at home?
DEBRA
Oh, you mean Rudy? I’m not calling
until he apologizes. I’m done being
second choice.
DOAKES
Good for you, Morgan.
(hesitant beat)
Look, if you’re not doing anything
tonight, Masuka invited us to the Bel
Canto.
Debra looks up and smiles. For a moment, Doakes thinks the
smile is for him. Then he looks over his shoulder to see --
RUDY
standing in the hallway with a bouquet of WHITE ROSES,
waiting for Debra. She stares at him. He stares back.
Rudy enters the bullpen, and Doakes quietly slips away.
RUDY
For you.
He hold out the roses.
DEBRA
Too late. You blew me off.
RUDY
I didn’t blow you off. This is the
first chance I’ve had to come talk.
Rudy sets the roses on her desk.
DEBRA
I’m too tired to talk.
RUDY
So let’s just go home. Fall into bed.
DEBRA
Why, Rudy? I mean... fucking why?
You didn’t wanna “fall into bed” the
other night. After I laid my heart
out on the phone. You wanted to hang
out with my brother.

RUDY
I was confused.
DEBRA
Yeah, well I’m not confused. That’s

RUDY
I was confused because I love you.
DEBRA
(still rolling)
What I want is very simple and -- what
did you just say?
RUDY
I love you.
DEBRA
Don’t even try to --
Rudy steps close and kisses her. Debra gives in to it. The
kiss grows in passion. Suddenly, Debra pulls away.
DEBRA
Oh fuck...
RUDY
What?
DEBRA
I love you, too.
They kiss again, harder, more passionately. Rudy winces.
RUDY
Ow.
DEBRA
What happened to your lip?
REVEAL a trickle of blood from the corner of Rudy’s lip.
RUDY
It’s nothing. Mishap with a tool at
the workshop.
DEBRA
Well, let’s get you home and take care
of it.
She wraps her arm around his waist and they head out.

A59 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 4 A59
CLOSE on Dexter, sweating.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Rita’s ex-husband taught me something.
Problems don’t go away by themselves.
Sometimes they require... creative
solutions. I found one for Paul. Now
it’s my turn.
The elevator DINGS and the door opens. With dread, Dexter
stares out at --
59 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 4 59
Dexter nervously steps off the elevator and walks down the
long hallway. His heart pounds.
DEXTER (V.O.)
So this is doom. I’ve been the
architect of so much of it, it’s only
fair I should know what all the fuss
is about.
He reaches the door and stares at the room number: 103.
DEXTER (V.O.)
He left me this room for a reason.
Five women gave their blood, their
lives, for this moment. There’s only
one way to find out why.
He ducks under the YELLOW POLICE TAPE and opens the door.
60 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - ROOM 103 - NIGHT 4 (CONTINUOUS) 60
Dexter stands at the threshold.
DEXTER (V.O.)
The belly of the beast.
Dexter takes a deep breath and enters, eyes cast downward.
He maneuvers through the scaffolding and sits on the floor
as the boy in his memory sat. Dexter raises his head to
look at the bloody walls. Instantly, the room SWIRLS --
FLASHBACK TO:
61 INT. DARK ENCLOSED SPACE 61
The boy sitting in blood wails. We see the whole picture
this time.
DEXTER 110 "Seeing Red" Final Draft -- 9/20/06 59.
The images are clearer, the details in sharper focus. A
DEAD MAN lies nearby, face down in inch-deep blood. Around
him are more DEAD BODIES. And BODY PARTS.
THREE-YEAR-OLD DEXTER’S POV
A WOMAN, sprayed in blood, is held by a LARGE COLUMBIAN MAN.
WOMAN
Honey, don’t cry. Please don’t cry.
Another MAN steps into view and strikes the woman. She
collapses into the blood. Three-year-old Dexter wails.
WOMAN
Don’t kill me. Please. I’ll give it
back. I swear...
A THIRD MAN pulls the cord on a CHAINSAW. Over and over.
WOMAN
No! No no! Not in front of my baby!
(desperate to Dexter)
Don’t look! Don’t look, honey! Cover
you eyes!
Finally the engine catches and the blade ROARS.
THREE-YEAR-OLD DEXTER
Mommy! Mommy...!
We hear her SCREAMS. The chainsaw hits bone and GRINDS. As
the blood SPRAYS THE WALLS around the helpless boy...
RESUME:
62 INT. MARINA VIEW HOTEL - ROOM 103 - NIGHT 4 (CONTINUOUS) 62
An OVERHEAD SHOT of Dexter. Lying on his back. Looking up

ON DEXTER, bathed in the warm, golden light of sunrise. He
walks alongside the ocean.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Daybreak. I know it should be
inspiring. Everything comes alive,
people stumble out of their homes
to find their place in the world.
As he walks, he notices YOUNG ROLLERBLADERS up on the
boardwalk and SHOPKEEPERS greeting each other "good morning."
DEXTER (V.O.)
I imagine it's beautiful when
you're a part of it. But I'm not.
I'm not like other people.
He walks past a YOUNG ROMANTIC COUPLE, HOLDING HANDS,
watching the sunrise at the horizon.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I go through the world by myself.
I have no place in it, no real way
to connect. For me, daybreak is
just another reminder...
He looks down the beach — PAN OVER, reveal his destination:
an array of UNIFORMS and YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE.
DEXTER (V.O.)
... that I'm always alone.
He approaches the crime scene, moving past the yellow tape,
flashing his ID to a UNIFORM. Finds a group of UNIFORMS in a
tight circle. Surrounding something he can't see —
BATISTA (O.C.)
Dexter.
Dexter turns, finds BATISTA, steno pad in hand, approaching.
BATISTA
Glad you're here. We need you,
bro.
2.
v-ffiR ^
DEXTER
I live to serve.
BATISTA
Yeah? Well, here we go.
He leads Dexter toward the knot of uniforms. As they
approach, the officers part, revealing
A CHAISE LOUNGE
facing the ocean and the rising sun, reclined only partway.
On the lounge: a PAIL AND SHOVEL, an inflated BEACH BALL...
... and a HUMAN HAND, its fingers curled down... except the
middle one, up in a "FUCK YOU" position.
Crime scene PERSONNEL scour the area for any evidence — a
TECH dusts each of the items on the chaise as:
DEXTER (V.O.)
I can hear my heart pounding in my
chest...
The hand rests upright against the back of the lounge, as if
Z**^ calmly watching the sunrise. BLOOD pools at the wrist.
DEXTER
What do we know?
BATISTA
Well... we know it's a hand.
(serious)
Lifeguard called it in this morning
when she showed up for work. *Bout
seven-thirty. Beach was deserted,
no one here.
DEXTER
Couldn't have been here too long —
blood's still reddish and wet. Guy
probably left here just before the
lifeguard found it.
BATISTA
Like he planned it. The timing.
TECH
And sir? There's nothing on
 xem.
Any of these. Wiped clean.
• BATISTA
Quite a set-up the guy left us.
3.
DEXTER
Look at this. It's deliberate.
Artistic. Almost like...
(turning to Batista)
Could this be our guy?
BATISTA
Wait, who?
DEXTER
The Ice Truck Killer.
BATISTA
Naw, dude, I doubt it. He's gonna
be in Mexico by now. Statewide
manhunt, his face everywhere. He
couldn't scratch his ass without
the news wires picking it up.
TECH
There was also this. In the pail.
Using a gloved hand, he hands a PHOTOGRAPH to Batista.
' BATISTA
/^ Huh. Well, this is... weird.
He holds it up for Dexter to see: it's a photograph of the
scene itself, the chaise lounge, the beach accessories and
the bloody hand.
DEXTER.
Yeah... it is.
BATISTA
(handing back the photo)
Bag this. Go ahead and get the
prints off the hand.
As the prints expert sets about INKING the hand's fingers..
BATISTA
We'll have an ID soon, that oughta
tell us something. I hope you're
wrong. Last thing we need is that
psycho coming back to haunt us.
FLASH CUT: YOUNG DEXTER, standing off to the side on this
very beach, watching YOUNG DEBRA building a sand castle.
HARRY approaches Dexter, a plastic pail in hand, and —
j0&*\
RESUME SCENE, as Dexter reels, something not quite right.
4.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But it's happening. He's back,
(turning back to the hand)
And it looks like he's got
something to say.
INT. POLICE STATION - LAGUERTA'S OFFICE - MORNING
ON A TELEVISION SCREEN airing a MUTED morning newscast — the
ANCHOR talks to a MEDICAL EXPERT, and a CHYRON at the bottom
of the screen reads "HUMAN HAND FOUND ON BEACH".
PAN ACROSS to find LaGuerta at her desk on the phone.
LAGUERTA
... then tell the governor he's
more than welcome to increase our
funding. The more manpower we put
out on the street, the sooner we
locate Tucci and bring him in...
She looks up to see CAPTAIN MATTHEWS enter her office.
LAGUERTA
Kelly, I'll have to get back to
you.
She hangs up, turns to the captain.
LAGUERTA
Captain. You look like you
swallowed a lemon. What's the —
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
ID came back on the hand at the
beach.
(tossing a lab report on
her desk)
Tony Tucci.
LAGUERTA
What? No. No fucking way. It's
gotta be a mistake.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
No, the mistake, Maria, was
unleashing a high-profile manhunt
for Tucci and declaring him the Ice
Truck Killer. I warned you to
tread lightly.
5.
f LAGUERTA
I made a judgment call based on
what I knew —
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Which was precious little. Now
look at you. You spent a week
demonizing the Ice Truck Killer's
newest victim. We'11 be
backpedaling for months.
LAGUERTA
We still don't know for sure he's
not the killer, this could be —
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Don't.
(quiet)
You screwed up. You wanted to be .
on TV. You wanna be the new face
of the department? Fine. But do
something to rein this thing in.
Fast. Do your job.
LAGUERTA
I —
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Start by talking to Tucci's mother.
She defended her son to the press
all week. You go talk to that
woman. You tell her what you did.
He leaves, and LaGuerta, fairly stunned, doesn't move.
EXT. PETRIE BEACH - CRIME SCENE - MORNING
FULL-BLOWN CRIME SCENE. Helicopters. K-9 unit. Uniforms at
the crime-scene tape to ensure onlookers don't get past. FIND
[ Batista walking to the scene with DOAKES:.
BATISTA
... Espenson was the first officer
On the scene, she reported both
points of entry over there —
(he points to TWO PATHS
leading to the street)
— were clear at the time. Witness
didn't see anything there, either.
Doakes looks over to the street, distracted for a moment...
6.
( DOAKES
Right. Just get me your notes...
... by TWO, TOUGH GUY THUGS standing across the street. Not
moving. Watching him. Without taking his eyes off them:
DOAKES
Make sure Espenson checks in with
me, too.
MOVE PAST, FIND DEBRA and Dexter, walking past the chaos:
DEBRA
I knew Tucci wasn't the killer! I
knew it! Man, I wish I coulda been
there to see LaGuerta get bitchslapped.
You think she cried?
DEXTER
I don't know if that's —
DEBRA
I bet she cried. Dammit, I always
miss the good shit,
DEXTER
You're here for this. Pretty
exciting stuff. Ice Truck Killer
makes his next move.
DEBRA
Yeah. No, you're right. Kind of a
new thing for him — blood, the
hand, the photo. Makes you wonder
what the message is.
(re: the hand, still
flipping us off)
I mean, other than the obvious.
DEXTER
Yeah, not a lot of room for
interpretation there. But the
larger message... I don't know.
DEBRA
Could be that's it. Just payback.
DEXTER
Could be. Guy's pissed, LaGuerta
started a statewide manhunt, got
vfll^S. all this media attention —
DEBRA
All for a fuckwit rent-a-cop.
Killer probably thinks we insulted
his intelligence or something.
DEXTER
We did. But it's a lot of change.
I think he's trying to say
something else, too.
A beat as they think about that, let it sink in. Then:
DEBRA
I wonder if Matthews yelled at her
in her office or out where everyone
could hear. Dude, I'm so pissed.
(calling)
Hey! Dantas! It's a fuckin' oven
out here, any place to grab a soda?
OFFICER DANTAS, a fresh-faced young uniform, runs over to
Deb, eager to help.
OFFICER DANTAS
Yeah, you wanna hit the Mack Shack
about a block over. Burger joint.
Supposed to be famous or something.
DEBRA
Wait, I thought the Mack Shack was
over at Rand Beach. Isn't this
Petrie Beach?
OFFICER DANTAS
Oh, Petrie Beach is Rand Beach.
They renamed it a few years back.
DEBRA
Shit. I didn't know that. You
know that?
DEXTER
No. Didn't Dad used to take us
here all the time?
DEBRA
Yeah. I didn't even recognize it,
it's so built up and stuff.
Dexter turns, his eyes sweeping the street in front of him.
DEXTER
Yeah. Me either.
8.
^ INT. TUCCI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
LaGuerta, sympathetic and sincere, faces a tearful MRS.
TUCCI, mother of the ice-rink guard.
MRS. TUCCI
But then... where's the rest of his
body?
LAGUERTA
We're looking for it now. I'm so
sorry. All of Miami Metro is here
for you, and we will stop at
nothing until we catch the animal
that did this to your son.
Mrs. Tucci doesn't respond; she covers her face with her
hands, as if hiding her grief. LaGuerta reaches for her...
LAGUERTA
I can't imagine how difficult this
must be for you.
At LaGuerta's touch, Mrs. Tucci BACKS AWAY. She pulls away
her hands, eyes LaGuerta.
MRS. TUCCI
Yes. It is difficult.
(stiffening)
Almost as difficult as it was
watching you on TV all week,
calling my son a killer.
ON LAGUERTA: busted.
LAGUERTA
I — oh, Mrs. Tucci, I'm sorry you
got that impression, we'd hoped to
find your son because the
department considered him a person
of interest —
MRS. TUCCI
How dare you? How dare you come to
my home with your sympathy and your
"stop at nothing"? You called my
boy a killer every day.
LAGUERTA
This is a hard time for you, I'll —
9.
MRS. TUCCI
He was a good boy, and you
destroyed his name. And now he's
dead. Get out of my house.
LaGuerta, shaken, goes to the door and hurries outside.
INT. RITA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dexter and Rita on the floor, against the couch. Close.
Young Frankenstein on the TV. Rita laughs...
DEXTER (V.O.)
Generally, laughter doesn't do much
for me. Truth be told, when most
people laugh, it's pretty annoying.
But not Rita. Her laugh is
different. It's pure.
... and she leans on Dexter's shoulder.
RITA
(along with the TV)
He! Was! My! Boyfriend!
/"^ DEXTER (V.O.)
And it's a nice break. Even if I'd
rather keep working on finding my
new friend.
Dexter smiles at her giddy enthusiasm, strokes her hair.
Outside, a DOG HOWLS. Rita rolls her eyes.
RITA
Great...
DEXTER
What? What was that?
RITA
The horrible woman next door. It's
her dog. Poor thing. She leaves
it out in the yard all day, all
night.
DEXTER
That's terrible.
RITA
I just think it's so sad.
{ The dog HOWLS again, more plaintive than before.
/£$PN
/^^S
10.
DEXTER
Tell you what, why don't I go talk
to this woman?
RITA
No. Don't do that.
DEXTER
Why not?
RITA
You know... good fences, all that.
The dog howls again. Rita turns to Dexter: she's at a loss.
RITA
I don't want to pick a fight with
my neighbor. You've gotta pick
your battles.
ASTOR and CODY stumble in, half-awake. Upset.
RITA
Oh, babies, did the dog wake you?
CODY
Yes. He's sad.
ASTOR
And loud.
RITA
I know, honey.
Dexter looks from the kids' sleepy faces to Rita's utter
frustration. He stands.
DEXTER
Be right back.
EXT. BONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Dexter approaches, but as soon as he steps on the neighbor's
property, the dog starts BARKING furiously. Undeterred,
Dexter knocks, and the door opens, revealing BONNIE, a
petite, twentyish, impatient woman.
DEXTER
Hi. I don't think we've met —
BONNIE
Yeah. Boyfriend of the chick next
door. Hey.
11.
DEXTER
Yes. Hello. I was hoping we could
talk for just a moment. That dog
you just got...
BONNIE
Yeah, Limp Bizkit. I know he
didn't get out, I can hear him.
(shouting)
Shut! Up!
DEXTER
No, no, nothing like that. But he
does cry. A lot. It's upsetting
the kids, and I was hoping we could
figure something out.
(then)
Cute name. Limp Bizkit.
BONNIE
Look — dogs make noise. It's what
they do.
DEXTER
Yes. But that's a lot of noise.
BONNIE
I'm.right in the middle of
something...
DEXTER
Well, maybe tomorrow. We could
work together, find a way to help
him.... not cry.
(getting no response)
The kids can't sleep.
BONNIE
Maybe that's *cause they think
their crackhead father's gonna come
back and beat them up again.
(off Dexter's surprise)
Try ear plugs.
She SLAMS the door shut. After a beat, Dexter turns. ON HIS
FACE — for a quick beat, he wears a familiar, cold,
reptilian expression.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I could make things so much easier
for Rita.
Dexter takes a deep breath.
12.
( DEXTER (V.O.)
But that would be wrong.
The moment passes, Dexter turns from the house, walks back to
Rita's...
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - MORNING
LaGuerta strides through the room, head buried in a progress
report, when Captain Matthews approaches her.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Here.
He hands her a copy of the Miami Herald.
LAGUERTA
What am I looking at?
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Page one. Today's Josh Adams
column. I think you'll find it
particularly insightful.
He stays a beat, shaking his head. Disappointed. As he
/**•• walks off, LaGuerta looks down, sees the headline: "LATEST
BLUNDER HIGHLIGHTS TROUBLES IN PD BRASS". She's pissed.
.INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - MORNING
A GROUP OF REPORTERS stands around, waiting impatiently for
news. LaGuerta rounds a corner, pissed, and they rush her:
REPORTERS
Lieutenant! Any news?/Where did
the killer leave the rest of the
body?/Has the family been notified?
LAGUERTA
(ignoring them)
Josh Adams.
JOSH ADAMS, 30, boyish grin, deceptively jovial, turns.
LAGUERTA
Come with me.
She drags him — not entirely gently — around the corner,
away from the other reporters. Slams the Herald on a table.
yyr^x LAGUERTA
What the hell is this?
13.
JOSH
Lieutenant, good morning. Nice to
see you. And I believe that's a
newspaper.
LAGUERTA
"Maria LaGuerta spends so much of
her time on camera — "
JOSH
You read my column? I'm flattered —
LAGUERTA
" — that one local news station
offered to put her on the payroll."
| JOSH
I (shrugging)
• I hear those TV gigs are hard to
f get, sounds pretty sweet to me.
/0^>\
LAGUERTA
We have a city-wide crisis on our
hands, there's a lunatic running
around torturing and killing our
citizens. I'm trying to stop him.
JOSH
Oh. That's what you were doing.
LAGUERTA
You wanna wear a badge and go after
him? Be my guest. *Cause so far?
All I see is someone standing on
the sidelines criticizing me for
trying to keep people safe.
But as she turns to walk away:
JOSH
You know what's interesting,
Lieutenant? You're so upset that I
called you a camera hog.
She stops, turns back to Josh. Not sure where he's going.
JOSH
I also slammed you for jumping on
Tucci as a suspect before you
gathered all the facts. But that
part doesn't seem to bother you.
40tt\
/^^N
14.
LaGuerta stares at Josh for a beat, about to answer when her
CELL PHONE RINGS. Without a word to Josh, she answers.
LAGUERTA
What.
(she listens/her face
falls)
Shit.
Without even a glance toward Josh, she hurries away, back to
her office...
CUT TO:
INT. OFFICE PARK - MORNING
A HUMAN FOOT.
It's posed against a concrete bench, surrounded by a baseball
bat, and cap. Cut at the shin, sporting a bloody running
shoe, it's as horrifically designed as the hand at the beach.
REVEAL Dexter, the calm, pensive center of an ongoing storm
of investigators on the scene, the fingerprints expert there,
too, DUSTING the objects and INKING the toes. Suddenly:
SGT. DOAKES
Not paying you to stand around and
goddamned stare.
Dexter turns, sees Doakes behind him. Smiles at him.
DEXTER
Sorry. Just taking it in before I
get to work. Don't mean to be in
the way.
(off Doakes' look)
I thought Angel was working this
case.
SGT. DOAKES
That was before we knew it was the
Ice Truck Freak. Then LaGuerta put
me on it. So I'm on lead now.
DEXTER
Great! Welcome!
Doakes just stares at Dexter for a beat, not sure what to
make of his friendliness. Finally:
SGT. DOAKES
Just do your thing.
%0fc\
15.
Dexter crouches next to the prints expert and gloves up.
DEXTER
Right off? Same kind of cutting
tool as the the hand. Cut's
smooth, almost surgical. Guy did
this carefully.
SGT. DOAKES
But what about the blood, Blood
Boy? Guy gives us body after body
with no blood in it, why's he
suddenly making the switch now?
DEXTER
I don't know that,
(reaching out)
But there's this.
He carefully lifts the cap to reveal ANOTHER PHOTO
underneath: the foot arrangement, baseball items and all.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I know these photos are part of the
message. But I still don't know
what the message is. What is he
telling us?
Dexter looks closely at the photo: in the background, a
building across the street, and on its roof, a giant, neonscripted
sign: "AMANDA SNACK CAKES, SINCE 1943".
Dexter looks around curiously, sees the building across the
street from the park. Sees the AMANDA SNACK CAKES sign.
SGT. DOAKES
Guy's making his crime scenes into
works of art.
DEXTER
Maybe. I don't know...
FLASH CUT: YOUNG DEXTER, surrounded by friends on a BASEBALL
DIAMOND — but under the AMANDA SNACK CAKES SIGN. Right
here. At this location. They pose for a picture, and FLASH!
RESUME SCENE: Dexter stares at the photo, shocked.
SGT. DOAKES
Bag the photo and finish up. ME's
waiting to get in there. Rest of
us don't have all goddamned day.
/#>*N
16.
But Dexter stays focused on the photo.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I need to get home...
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Dexter rushes in, goes right to the bookshelf. He's got his
cell phone to his ear, trying to multitask:
DEXTER
Angel, hey, I was just at the crime
scene... yeah, the new one... no,
I'm gonna be right in, I just had
to swing by my place and pick up
some lab reports.
He starts rifling through books on the shelf, looking for
something specific...
DEXTER
Okay, sure, I'll be in soon as I
can-.
He hangs up, pulls out from behind other books A PHOTO ALBUM.
FLASHBACK:
INT. MORGAN FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 1990S - DAY
Dexter, 20s, next to Harry on the couch. Dexter holds the
FAMILY PHOTO ALBUM in his hands, staring at it. Like it's an
alien artifact. Which, of course, it kind of is.
DEXTER
Well, gee, Dad. This is — uh...
HARRY
You hate it.
DEXTER
No. No, I don't know what to do
with it.
HARRY
Try opening it.
Dexter does: the pages are filled with MORGAN FAMILY PHOTOS.
HARRY
I know I'm not exactly the
scrapbooking type, but your mom
helped a little.
17.
DEXTER
You guys did this?
(off Harry's nod)
Why?
HARRY
You may not understand right now.
But these photos represent your
family and your connection to us.
He smiles warmly at Dexter.
HARRY
Connection's important, Dexter. I
want you always to remember that
you're loved, that your family
cares about you.
Dexter looks from the book up to Harry.
HARRY
When you feel lost in your life,
connection is what will tether you.
It's what will keep you from
spinning out of orbit. Okay? Will
you promise to remember that?
Off Dexter, silent...
END FLASHBACK:
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Dexter sitting at his desk, looking through the' photo album.
DEXTER (V.O.)
And I did remember.
Years' worth of MORGAN FAMILY PHOTOS flip past us...
DEXTER (V.O.)
I've never been an overlysentimental
type. Obviously. So
it's not like these photos mean
that much to me.
Dexter opens to one page with photos of his day as a young
boy at the baseball park with his friends. (We don't focus
on them, but some photos from the day should include Harry.)
{
jf0G&\M
18.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But having family photos is a way
to maintain my cover, appear to
have human emotions.
FIND one photo: Young Dexter, uncomfortable, and his group of
friends, one holding a ball, another a bat. Towering above
the group in the background across the street is the same
AMANDA SNACK CAKES sign we saw earlier.
DEXTER (V.O.)
And he used it. He recreated
photos from my family album. Same
locations and props and even
framing. Meticulous. It's not a
message to the city of Miami. It's
| a message to me.
| Dexter flips back a few pages in the album...
DEXTER (V.O.)
i He was in my apartment a few weeks
' ago. Maybe he looked through the
album then, which is, of course,
extremely violating. And also kind
of sweet.
... and finds a PHOTO of Harry, DORIS, YOUNG DEB and Young
Dexter at the BEACH. The kids and Harry on the sand,
surrounding Doris — on a chaise lounge.
DEXTER (V.O.)
All this work, and the only one who
can truly appreciate it is me.
It's all for me.
The photo is set up exactly like the one found at the first
crime scene on the beach.
DEXTER (V.O.)
It's hard not to be flattered.
EXT. RITA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Rita comes in in her hotel reception uniform, finds the kids
at the table: Astor's resting her head on her hand,
exhausted. Cody's actually got his head down on the table,
asleep next to his cereal bowl.
RITA
Guys! Come on, we gotta go!
/0IX\
19.
The kids barely move. They're wiped out. OFF Rita, feeling
awful.
INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICERS; LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Doakes enters,, moves to a locker. Then MCNAMARA enters in a
towel, freshly-showered. Takes a locker down the row.
Doakes does his best to ignore the guy, but, after a beat:
SGT. DOAKES
I've been trying to keep quiet
outta respect for your sister, but
now? You're some kinda goddamn
asshole, know that?
MCNAMARA
(brightly)
Hey, man. What's up? Fuck
anyone's wife lately?
SGT. DOAKES
What you're doing? Letting
Guerrero think I'm responsible for
the attack on his guy? You know
what that means for me.
McNamara just shrugs, keeps toweling off.
SGT. DOAKES
I got his guys following me now,
did you know that? Trailing
everywhere I go.
MCNAMARA
Fuck, James. That sounds pretty
bad. You should definitely alert
the police. Unless maybe there's
some reason the officers of Miami
Metro wouldn't be interested in
helping you.
SGT. DOAKES
He will kill me. When, not if.
MCNAMARA
(pulling on shorts)
Hey, man. Not my problem.
SGT. DOAKES
(losing it)
Motherfucker!
20.
( McNamara tries to walk past Doakes on his way to the sinks.
Doakes steps into the aisle, blocks him.
SGT. DOAKES
Listen to me, you shitball. Your
sister's husband chose his
undercover life over her.
MCNAMARA
I —
SGT. DOAKES
Over. Her. She begged him to come
home, and he told her no. He
wasn't there for her when she was
alone and scared. And she ended up
murdered because of it.
He steps aside, but McNamara doesn't move.
SGT. DOAKES
Because of him. I cared about her.
Shit all over me as much as you
want, but I cared about her.
Doakes turns back to his locker.
MCNAMARA
Yeah? Well fuck that, she never
said anything like that to me.
SGT. DOAKES
Because she didn't think you'd take
it too good. Go fucking figure.
Doakes, his anger vented, turns and walks from the room.
INT. POLICE STATION - LABORATORY - DAY
CLOSE ON the severed foot. A SWAB moves in, wipes at the
exposed bone.
DEXTER (V.O.)
So I know the killer's talking to
me. And now I just need to figure
out what he's saying.
Dexter, gently places the swab into a protective tube.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Why those photos from my album?
Why a hand and a foot? How is it
all connected?
j0*\
21.
Batista enters.
/$&*.
y0X>\
BATISTA
Hey, bro, you busy?
DEXTER
Nope. Looking for possible foreign
bodies. Anything that might've
gotten in there that could tell us
where the killer kept this guy.
(still focusing)
Hey, did you see the spatter on the
sneaker?
BATISTA
Dude? You've gotta find a hobby.
Something outside this building.
DEXTER
I like helping. Arrest me.
BATISTA
All right, well help ma. Got this
anniversary coming up with the
wife. Ten years.
DEXTER
(not looking up from his
exam of the foot)
Wow.
BATISTA
Yeah, only I don't know what to get
her. Gotta be something good. You
know how women are about these
things.
DEXTER
Hang on, check this out.
BATISTA
Me, I couldn't care less. Way I
see it, I kinda wonder why she's
not just happy with the gift I give
her every night, know what I mean?
DEXTER
No, wait, come look at this.
(as Batista joins him)
The lack of coagulation. Spatter
on the hand, spatter on the foot.
Both extremities were taken from a
body that was still alive.
22.
( BATISTA
Yeah, well, we knew that. Guy's a
mean sonofabitch, we figured he
chopped the victim up, who knows
how many pieces he's still got —
DEXTER
No.
Dexter pushes past him, goes to the computer at the side of
the room. Brings up a rotating, 3-D IMAGE of the HAND from
the beach: complete with bruises and discolorations and all.
DEXTER
Look.
BATISTA
What? I don't see —
Dexter TAPS the screen, urgency edging into his voice.
DEXTER
Look. The lividity. The bruising,
the grayness there, it's the same
on the hand and the foot. Each
turned up looking the same. Almost
no decomposition.
BATISTA
Wait... no decomposition. On both?
The same?
(afraid of the answer)
But... we found them a day apart.
DEXTER
I know.
Batista turns back to the foot, horror in his voice:
BATISTA
Madre de dios...
SMASH TO:
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY
LaGuerta and Doakes work at the BIG BOARD, covered with
pictures of crime scenes, victims' candids, Miami maps. They
look up when Batista and Dexter come careening over.
SGT. DOAKES
The hell...
23,
BATISTA
L.T. You gotta listen to him.
DEXTER
It's the guard. Tucci. I think
he's still alive. I think the
killer is keeping him alive
somewhere while he... while he
performs the amputations.
LAGUERTA
Bullshit. Bullshit, the guy's a
killer, not a doctor.
DEXTER
Maybe he's both.
SGT. DOAKES
(to Batista)
You got someone in the lab checking
on this? Someone else, I mean?
BATISTA
Yeah. But they're gonna say he's
right.
DEXTER
Clean cuts, like an amputation,
blood pooling and lividity
consistent with blood flow at the
time of amputation in both cases —
LAGUERTA
Shit. He's still alive...
BATISTA
There's something else.
DEXTER
If the hand came off yesterday at 7
am, and the foot came in this
morning at 7 am, then —
SGT. DOAKES
— then we're gonna be getting
another body part tomorrow at 7 am.
DEXTER
Yeah.
LAGUERTA
( But he's still alive. I still have
a shot —
/0**S
24.
{*• She gets up, moves to leave.
i
BATISTA
A shot at what?
LAGUERTA
It's nothing. Yet.
(to Doakes)
Let the captain know. And let him
know I'11 be back in a couple
hours.
She hurries from the room...
EXT. TUCCI HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
Mrs. Tucci opens her door and reacts — LaGuerta stands on
the front porch. LaGuerta appears nervous, even excited.
LAGUERTA
Mrs. Tucci? I have some news. I
think your son might still be
alive.
MRS. TUCCI
What?
LAGUERTA
I'd like to talk to you about it if
you don't mind.
Mrs. Tucci says nothing... tears well up in her eyes.
LaGuerta notices her holding very tightly to the door, as if
she doesn't even trust her own ability to stay standing...
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY
As the officers on the case assemble, facing the Big Board,
Batista, sitting with Dexter towards the back, leans in:
BATISTA
Still don't know what to get my
wife. It's a big deal, you think
of anything?
DEBRA
(slipping in next to them)
Tenth anniversary? Lingerie. Get
her lingerie. Let her know you
still think she's hot.
Batista sits back, grinning: that's it. Doakes at the board:
25.
(^ DOAKES
So what do we know?
Everyone settles it, instantly serious. Coming together.
DOAKES
We have a beach and an office park.
DEB
And we have a hand and a foot.
DOAKES
Right. Theories?
BATISTA
Beach is play, office is work.
Maybe it's something about work
versus play.
DOAKES
Maybe. But they're gonna keep
coming, long as Tucci can stand it,
and I don't see a third prong
there. What else?
yi^^V BATISTA
There's blood. He's leaving blood
now, that's new.
DOAKES
Right.
FINGERPRINT EXPERT
And the photos, they're new.
DEBRA
He wants to be remembered. You use
photos to memorialize things.
Dexter stays very still, not giving away his connection to
the photos... yet.
BATISTA
But it doesn't help us with the
question of what's next, where the
next body part will show up.
DOAKES
Let alone where the psycho is
keeping Tucci. So far, every
_ object left by our guy gives us
{ nothing. No prints, no residue.
Nothing about where he is.
26.
J&&*\
BATISTA
Least that part is consistent with
his M.O.
DOAKES
Right. It's the only part that is.
He's changed everything else.
DEBRA
He's changed everything else.
She turns to Dexter, beaming. She's got it.
DEBRA
He's changed everything else. And
the places have changed, just like
he did.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen? My sister.
DEBRA
The beach changed names, the office
park used to be a place for kids.
Doakes nods admiringly,
DEBRA
Locations that have changed.
That's what we're looking for.
PUSH IN on Dexter's face, the realization hitting him..
INT. DEXTER'S LABORATORY - LATER
Dexter at his desk, slowly laying out the TWO FAMILY
PHOTOGRAPHS from his album.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I know things they don't. I know
it's about me,about places I went
as a kid. So I should find a place
I've been... that's changed.
He pulls his photo album from his backpack, holds it.
DEXTER (V.O.)
The only person who can find Tucci
is me. I know this. His life is
in my hands. It's a burden, one
I'm used to... just not this way.
27.
EXT. BONNIE'S HOUSE - MORNING
Bonnie's door FLIES open, and she stands there, pissed,
facing a determined, though nervous, Rita.
BONNIE
What?
RITA
Um, hi. I'm here to discuss your
dog —
BONNIE
Yeah, I'm shocked. I'm sorry he's
noisy. It's just the kind of dog
he is. I can't help you.
RITA
Well, I think you can. Like maybe
you could take him inside.
(off her scoffing)
He's causing a disturbance for
everyone.
BONNIE
Everyone?. ''Cause far as I can
tell, you're the only one
complaining.
RITA
That's not the point —
BONNIE
Except when you tried sending your
boyfriend over to fight your
battles for you.
RITA
He doesn't fight my battles.
(steeling herself)
Look. My kids are exhausted. So
you need to put that dog in at
night, feed it on a schedule, give
it some exercise now and...
(realizing)
I'm sorry, is something funny?
Indeed, Bonnie has started laughing.
BONNIE
No. It's sad. But you're funny.
Look at you. All tough.
28.
RITA
I'll — I'm going to call the
police.
BONNIE
And they'11 tell me to keep the dog
quiet, and I'll say I will, and
they'll leave, and the dog will go
back to doing what he does.
There's nothing they can do.
There's nothing you can do. But
you are funny.
She shuts the door in Rita's face. Rita stands for a beat.
Furious, she turns to her house and sees, right in front of
her, the fence separating her yard from Bonnie's.
And, poking through the slats in that fence: a wet, dark
DOG'S NOSE. Rita stares for a moment, watching the poor
thing sniffing, then she turns and hurries back to her house.
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Come around Dexter, on the couch, in his pajama pants,
looking through his photo album...
DEXTER (V.O.)
A place I went as a kid. A place
that's changed. What would have
caught...
Continue pulling around, pushing in, as Dexter settles on one
page... and full stop. His face relaxes. Success.
DEXTER (V.O.)
... my playmate's eye?
EXT. MIAMI CONDO COMPLEX - FRONT GATE - MORNING
Dexter approaches the front gate of the building, looks off
in the distance to see a LARGE ORANGE TREE. A CRUDE SMILEY
FACE has been carved into its trunk.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I used to love this place. But it
wasn't cheap condos back then.
CLOSE ON a pho.to in Dexter's hand: Young Dexter, happy and
smiling into the camera. In the background: A LANDFILL, two
BULLDOZERS packing waste into the ground. In the distance,
^ we see the smiley orange tree.
29.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Watching the bulldozers press the
garbage, layer after layer, right
into the earth itself. Burying it.
I found it soothing.
He walks to the exact spot where the old photo was taken,
lining up the position of the tree to match the old framing.
DEXTER (V.O.)
It's all changed now. Like the
other places.
He looks to his feet, looks around him, searching for the
latest delivery from the killer. Nothing out of order...
DEXTER (V.O.)
It's seven-thirty-five, well past
the killer's regular drop-off time.
Did I miss him? Did he hide it
somewhere?
He catches himself, grins.
DEXTER (V.O.)
i {'am^' Look at me. I'm actually excited.
The thrill of the chase, maybe.
Only I give chase all the time.
This is different. It's —
i A BUZZING SOUND distracts him ~ his pager. Uh oh.
EXT. OUTDOOR MIAMI CHRISTMAS DISPLAY - MORNING
From inside the crime scene this time, on Batista with Doakes
| once again. Find Dexter, working his way through the curious
crowd toward us, his face giving away his shock and
( disappointment: he got it wrong. Deb intercepts him.
DEBRA
Hey, Brother.
DEXTER
What'd they find?
Reveal a LARGE, ORNAMENTED CHRISTMAS TREE, part of a public,
city-square-type display. The prints expert is in the
tedious process of dusting EVERY ORNAMENT.
DEBRA
,*=*. Ankle to knee. He's moving up the
( leg.
30,
f REVERSE POV: among the candy canes and glittery ornaments on
the tree, find a BLOODY, PARTIAL LEG hanging from the boughs.
From the ankle to the shin: not much, but still disturbing.
DEBRA
Have a holly, jolly, fucking
Christmas, huh?
DEXTER
What about the photo? Did he leave
a photo?
DEBRA
Next branch over.
They move closer, find a photo of the tree itself: it's
almost festive, except for the bloody limb hanging on it.
DEBRA
Batista's giving Doakes the first
officer report, but it's all the
same. No prints, no residue. No
evidence.
DEXTER
l/
fflWv' And the bruising's the same. Cut
this morning no doubt.
DEBRA
Yeah, one good thing that's come
out of this? You made us all
fuckin' lividity experts, bro.
(beat)
You think Tucci's still alive?
DEXTER
If he is... he won't be much
longer.
DEBRA
I wanna find this guy. I just
don't see how some Christmas
display fits the pattern. How're
we supposed to know what the next
place is gonna be?
Dexter stares at the tree. Fascinated, but disappointed.
DEXTER
I honestly don't know.
31.
( INT. POLICE STATION - LABORATORY - DAY
ON DEXTER, his face reflecting a cool, flickering GLOW. In
his hand, a PHOTO of Harry, Doris and Young Adult Dexter in
front of the CHRISTMAS DISPLAY. EARLY NINETIES. The tree is
smaller, the surrounding city more modest... PULL AROUND...
DEXTER (V.O.)
I screwed up.
... REVEAL Dexter stands in front of THREE COMPUTER MONITORS.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I got the killer's message wrong.
The monitors each display a different rotating 3-D image: a
body part found during the investigation.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But the thing that bothers me isn't
so much that I didn't figure it
out, although, let's be clear, that
is troubling. What bothers me...
PAN ACROSS the images, revealing the similar bruising and
f^- discolorations on each.
DEXTER (V.O.)
... is that I suddenly feel...
lonely. I want to share all this,
talk about it, but the only person
I want to share it with, the only
person to whom I feel that
connected...
CONTINUE PULLING AROUND until we come back to Dexter's face,
iridescent, thoughtful... and still.
DEXTER (V.O.)
... is someone I've never even met.
EXT. DOAKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE ENTRANCE - DAY
Doakes in his car, about to pull into the gate. He turns,
sees the THUGS sitting in a parked car across the street.
SGT. DOAKES
Fuck this...
v?^*V,
He throws his car into park, slams open the door. His hand
reaching for his holstered gun, he marches across the street.
32.
( SGT. DOAKES
What? You waiting for me,
assholes?
But the men start the car and drive away.
SGT. DOAKES
Hey! Hey!
He watches them go...
EXT. RITA'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
Dexter's car drives up and parks: Dexter gets out with Astor
and Cody, schoolbags over their shoulders, and, as they head
for the house:
ASTOR
So when's Mom coming home?
DEXTER
I don't know — she just said she
had an important errand to run. I
had to beg and beg to come pick you
up. She wanted you to ride a
{****• giraffe home.
CODY
(laughing)
No she didn't!
DEXTER
You're right, you're right. My
mistake. She said elephant.
ASTOR
Dexter!
DEXTER
Camel?
As the kids giggle, we hear:
BONNIE
Limp Bizkit! Limp Bizkit, where
the hell are you, you goddamned —
Dexter and the kids look over, see Bonnie, in her work
clothes, walking up the street.
33.
( DEXTER
(whispering)
Maybe Limp Bizkit finally got smart
enough to pick the lock and make a
fast getaway.
The kids giggle, as Bonnie keeps yelling:
BONNIE
Limp Bizkit! I will cut you into
steaks and eat you for breakfast!
ASTOR
Maybe he dug an escape tunnel with
his dog dish.
They all giggle some more — and Bonnie wheels around.
BONNIE
(to Dexter)
You. What'd you do with my dog?
DEXTER
Me? Nothing.
/*•"*• Bonnie tosses one more withering look at Dexter, then stalks
f off. Dexter does his best to smile reassuringly at the kids.
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
A car goes past, and we see, sticking his head out the
window, delighted by the sudden freedom: LIMP BIZKIT. The
car, a familiar 1970s pimped-out Caddy, pulls into
EXT. YELINA'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
... where it comes to a stop. The driver's door opens, and
Rita, in her reception uniform, steps out. YELINA, a coworker
in a hotel uniform matching Rita's, and TWO YOUNG'
GIRLS come running from the house. Rita beams.
RITA
Hey. Here he is. Just remember to
feed him, bathe him and take him
out at night. Okay?
The girls, shy but thrilled, stand back, awed by the dog.
YELINA
My nieces are shy sometimes.
-^ Girls, say thank you to Rita.
34.
/ The girls mumble quick HELLOS, and Rita smiles at them. She
opens the car door, and Limp Bizkit carefully walks to the
girls — as if he recognizes fellow gentle souls.
They bend down and hug him softly. He starts kissing them.
RITA
I knew this'd be a good match.
YELINA
It's a wonderful thing you've done.
Rita can't take her eyes off the girls with the dog. Smiles.
Proud of herself.
EXT. POLICE STATION - FRONT STEPS - DAY
Mrs. Tucci stands nervously at a podium in front of a SMALL
CROWD OF REPORTERS — including Josh. And behind Mrs. Tucci,
LaGuerta stands uncharacteristically silent. Just listening.
MRS. TUCCI
... told me yesterday that my son
(^ might be alive, but they asked me
not to release a statement then in
order to protect him.
(tearing up)
Now, as time runs out, it's become
more important we get the word out.
REPORTER
So would you say you're happy with
the way Miami Metro has handled
your son's case?
Mrs. Tucci sighs, thinks for a moment. Then:
MRS. TUCCI
Do I wish the department had
handled my son's disappearance
better at first? Of course.
ON LAGUERTA, remaining enigmatically stoic.
MRS. TUCCI
But these officers also discovered
Tony might be alive. They're
wasting no time looking for him
^v now. We have new hope because of
f them, and for that, I am grateful.
35.
{ The reporters CLAMOR to ask the next question, but the voice
that ends up rising above the others is Josh's:
JOSH
Question for Lieutenant LaGuerta,
how much longer do you expect Mr.
Tucci to be able to stay alive?
Mrs. Tucci blanches at the insensitive question. She turns
to LaGuerta, who steps to the podium and speaks quietly.
LAGUERTA
For the sake of Mr. Tucci and his
family, I'd ask you to refrain from
speculation at this point.
.(considering)
Spend some time talking to this
remarkably brave woman. You'll
have plenty of chances to hear from
me later.
She steps back. Finished. ANGLE ON Josh's face: surprised
by LaGuerta's move. LaGuerta looks around, sees
yr^i^s
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
on the sidelines. He NODS to her, approving. LaGuerta
remains serious, but it's clear the nod means a great deal.
As the reporters clamor to ask Mrs. Tucci another question..
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
ON DEXTER at his desk. Just the light of his desk lamp
illuminating his face. Frustrated. COME AROUND, see he
stares at the THREE FAMILY PHOTOS, arranged in front of him.
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Dexter looks up, sweeps the photos
under a blotter, goes to the door. Opens it to see
RITA
Hey.
DEXTER
Hey yourself. This is a nice
surprise. To what do I owe the
honor?
RITA
(shrugging)
I don't know. I was in a mood. I
j ! ^ know you' re hard at work on your
( case, thought I'd come check on
you.
(MORE)
36.
RITA (cont'd)
^ (then)
r " Can I come in?
DEXTER
Oh. Sure. Yes.
She brushes past him. Uncharacteristically sexy. Dexter
watches her, closing the door behind her. Intrigued.
DEXTER
You took care of your... mission?
RITA
Indeed I did. Limp Bizkit is
safely tucked away in the puppy
protection program.
(grinning)
It was kind of a rush.
She moves around to the desk. Dexter tenses, watches her.
RITA
Have there been any leads?
DEXTER
No. And I just keep going around
/****• and around on this thing. Can't
'• seem to get it out of my head.
Rita looks over at Dexter, sees the tension on his face.
RITA
I'm so sorry. I wish there was
something I could do to help.
DEXTER
I don't think there's anything you
can do.
RITA
Oh, I don't know. I'm a dog-napper
now. I can do all sorts of things.
Rita slides off his lap. Sexy smile. Kneels on the floor.
DEXTER
Okay... what... what are you doing?
She starts unbuckling his belt.
RITA
Whatever I want.
37.
f With a smile, Rita drops out of frame. Dexter's expression
is one of confusion —
DEXTER (V.O.)
I've come to appreciate the
comfortable moments with Rita, the
easy, quiet — oh.
— and then, surprising even himself, pleasure.
DEXTER (V.O.)
This... might be better.
EXT. BATISTA'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
Batista, a wrapped gift in one hand, a small, tasteful
bouquet of flowers in the other. The door opens, Batista
grins wide..; but NINA, his wife, does not.
NINA
Angel.
BATISTA
Happy anniversary, baby.
/ ^ He holds out the gifts. She makes no move to take them.
NINA
You know you shouldn't be here.
Batista's face falls.
BATISTA
I just thought... it's our
anniversary, maybe tonight we could
put that behind us.
NINA
(in Spanish)
It doesn't matter what night it is.
You can't be here.
(in English)
You know the terms of the
separation agreement. You have to
leave.
BATISTA
(resigned)
Okay. I know.
~B^ He turns, gifts still in hand, back to his car. Nina watches
( him go, her face softening. Clearly hating this. Then:
38.
NINA
Angel. Long as you're here, you
wanna see the kids?
OFF Angel's face: quiet relief.
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
In the afterglow. Dexter, spent, looks up at the ceiling,
his arm around Rita, who rests her head on his chest.
DEXTER
So that was... unexpected.
RITA
Yeah. For me, too.
DEXTER
I have no problem with unexpected.
RITA
(grinning)
You certainly don't.
She gets up, tousles Dexter's hair, straightens her clothes.
DEXTER
What about... I mean, are you... ?
RITA
I got exactly what I wanted. I
couldn't be more satisfied...
(sitting on the desk)
... tonight.
The blotter slides, revealing the three photos beneath it.
RITA
What are these?
DEXTER
Oh, just... I've been reorganizing
my photos a little, so —
RITA
You were so cute!
DEXTER
I... yeah. Thanks.
Your dad seems nice.
39.
^ DEXTER
My dad?
RITA
Yeah, in the pictures.
DEXTER
Well...
(getting up, putting on
his pants)
He's in two of them, but —
RITA
No, didn't you tell me he used to
take you and your friends to the
park to play ball? I just assumed
this was one of those. Didn't he
take this one?
DEXTER
(staring at the picture)
Yeah. He did.
He looks up, smiling at Rita.
/ ^ DEXTER
V You're a genius.
He gives her a kiss. She beams, confused but happy.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Latert alone now, Dexter stares at the three PHOTOS on the
coffee table.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Harry. That's what ties the photos
together. I never even thought of
it. And if you follow the train of
thought...
Dexter leafs through the pages of the photo album.
DEXTER (V.O.)
... it takes you here.
... REVEAL a photo of EARLY TWENTIES DEXTER standing next to
Harry in front of a large, rusted FREIGHTER being lowered by
yfSSSV a crane into DRY DOCK.
FLASHBACK:
40.
DEXTER (V.O.)
The last photo Harry took with me.
He wasn't comfortable taking photos
of himself after this. He started
getting sick.
PUSH IN FURTHER on the expressions on the men's faces in the
photo: Harry beaming, proud, Dexter trying hard. Too hard.
DEXTER (V.O.)
This is the endpoint, the place
where the killer's game must end.
ON DEXTER, his face resolved.
EXT. DRY DOCK - DAY
Dexter, 20s, walks beside Harry.
HARRY
Come on, you're gonna wanna see
this.
(~*- DEXTER
Yeah, I'm sure it's great, but I've
got chemistry homework, my
professor's already kicking my ass —
HARRY
Dexter. Look.
PULL AROUND to see the same freight boat, less-rusted, morepresentable,
being lowered by a MONSTROUS CRANE into the
dock. Just like in the photo.
DEXTER
Yeah. It's cool.
HARRY
Cool? Dexter, it's not just cool.
This is the same freighter on which
my father — your grandfather —
worked for thirty years, just to
put me through college.
DEXTER
I know.
HARRY
It's our connection to him, and
they're retiring the ship forever.
(MORE)
j(*3*\
41.
HARRY (cont'd)
Come on, let's get a picture.
(calling to a DOCK WORKER)
Hey! 'Scuse me, would you mind
taking our photo —
DEXTER
Dad! Stop it!
Harry turns, knows he's embarrassed his son.
DEXTER
I don't need a picture. I don't
want it . It's not important to me.
Harry's face can't hide his hurt. But Dexter presses on:
DEXTER
I look at those photos you gave me,
and I wish I felt what you want me
to feel. But I don't. I don't
feel connection. I don't feel
anything. They're just photos.
But the dock worker is already there, smiling at the two.
DOCK WORKER
Y'all ready?
Harry wordlessly hands him his camera, and the two men pose,
awkward, Harry forcing a smile. The FLASH goes off —
END FLASHBACK:
INT. BATISTA'S HOUSE - KIDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Batista stands over the side-by-side beds of his sleeping
SON, 7, and DAUGHTER, 4. Completely at peace.
BATISTA
(quietly)
Lo siento, mis hijos, lo siento, lo
siento, lo siento, lo siento...
NINA (O.S.)
Angel? Honey, I'm sorry, I need
you to go now, okay?
Batista lingers — then nods. He places the flowers on the
night stand, then walks, resigned, from the room.
INT. DOAKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
Doakes pulls in, parks in his space. He gets out.
Exhausted.
/•N
42.
Looks to the street, where the thugs waited before. They're
( not there. Doakes exhales, turns around to lock his car —
— where TWO SETS OF HANDS GRAB HIM, throw a BLACK BAG over
his head and roughly shove him into a WAITING CAR.
EXT. DRY DOCK - NIGHT
ON DEXTER, approaching the dock. PULL AROUND, reveal a
large, rusted, abandoned FREIGHT BOAT rising before him.
Dexter stops, staring at the image before him.
Dexter pulls the last PHOTO from his pocket, Harry and Dexter
in front of this very freighter held by the crane.
ANGLE ON the photo: the same view of the MIAMI SKYLINE, the
same marker, BUOY 13, floating in the ocean.
DEXTER (V.O.)
This is the place.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
The car from Doakes' garage rumbles to a stop next to a dark,
still LIMO. The same two Guerrero thugs get out of the car,
open the trunk and roughly shove Doakes, his head still
•*»"• covered, to the ground. Doakes doesn't move.
GUERRERO (O.C.)
Hello, James.
GUERRERO steps out of the limo and calmly walks over to
Doakes, reaching out and GRABBING the bag off Doakes' head.
Doakes blinks in the glare of the cars' headlights as:
GUERRERO
Why'd you hafta go and be such a
pain in the ass?
He slaps Doakes lightly across the face. Toying with him.
Doakes doesn't react. Guerrero PUNCHES him — hard — in the
jaw. Doakes falls over, still not saying a word.
Guerrero begins KICKING Doakes: violent, merciless.
EXT. DRY DOCK - NIGHT
Dexter inhales, sharply and walks toward the ship.
DEXTER (V.O.)
And the punch line in all this?
—^ Harry's pictures made me feel
I nothing. But the new ones, the
ones the killer's been leaving?
/^Wf\
43,
He climbs the ladder leading up to the ship's deck.
DEXTER (V.O.)
They make me feel something. They
make me feel connected.
He disappears over the top of the ladder, onto the deck...
DEXTER (V.O.)
Life can be so odd.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
The thugs pull Guerrero to his feet. One pulls out a gun and
holds it to the back of Doakes' head. Guerrero moves in
closer to Doakes.
GUERRERO
What gets me about pricks like you
is that you think you can break the
rules. You went after my guy. You
went after my daughter.
SGT. DOAKES
And you killed a cop's wife.
GUERRERO
I break the rules sometimes, I
allow for that. But I break the
rules, it's for a good reason. You
break the rules and —
The back of Guerrero's head EXPLODES with a POP in a mist of
blood. Startled, Doakes and the thugs look up, the thug with
the gun pulling it off Doakes, raising it —
Doakes ELBOWS him in the kneecaps, and another POP takes down
the thug. Another POP and the second thug goes down, too.
Doakes whips around... to see McNamara and his men
surrounding the scene, guns drawn.
While the other guys call in the bodies, Doakes catches his
breath, stares at McNamara. He stands, facing the other cop.
A moment of thick, barely-contained tension as the two stare
each other down, then:
SGT. DOAKES
I was bait. Is that it?
He turns...
44.
f MCNAMARA
Doakes. Doakes! James!
(calling after him)
I could've let Guerrero kill you.
I could've waited till his guys
shot you in the head and left you
in a swamp.
(getting no response)
But I didn't. We're done now,
Aaron. Five by five.
If Doakes finds any relief in that, any comfort at all, his
face certainly doesn't give it away.
INT. RUSTED FREIGHTER - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Dexter cautiously enters the room, a cramped, abandoned
living space. RATS scurry about as he enters, fleeing the
room. He looks around: plaques and maritime paintings on the
wall, a small wooden desk, and on a small bed...
TONY TUCCI.
Pale, drawn, weak. Blindfolded. Arms restrained, hooked to
an IV, the left one ends at his wrist — a bloody, bandaged
(/*Wv stump. His right knee also a bloody bandage. There's a
stillness here — as if death waits just outside the door.
DEXTER (V.O.)
He was left here for me to kill. A
gift. One I can't accept, of
course. This man doesn't deserve
it.
Upon hearing Dexter's footsteps, Tucci FLINCHES.
TUCCI
Look... please. Just kill me.
I've suffered enough. I'm ready.
(pained)
Just finish it and kill me.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Because the way I am connected to
Harry is the way that matters. In
his code of right and wrong.
That's a bond no one can break —
From out in the hallway, we hear a loud CLICK, and a CAMERA
FLASH goes off. Dexter wheels around: what was that?
\

i INT. RUSTED FREIGHTER - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Dexter moves quickly in swift pursuit. But not swift enough:
we get a quick glimpse of someone, could be anyone, rounding
the corner at the end of the corridor. Dexter hustles after
his prey, but we already hear footsteps on a ladder.
Dexter moves faster, rounds the corner himself. Gets to the
ladder leading up to the deck. Climbs it, getting to
EXT. RUSTED FREIGHTER - DECK - NIGHT
Dexter emerges from the hold, looks around. No one. The
place is desolate. Until he's distracted by an ENGINE'S ROAR
from the nearby parking lot. Dexter whips around to see
I A WOOD-PANELED STATION WAGON barreling out to the street,
i The driver just a shadow.
i
i DEXTER
\ Dammit!
He turns and sees something near the edge of the deck. Walks
toward it. REVEAL: a POLAROID CAMERA. With a DEVELOPING
i PHOTO sticking out of the picture slot.
Dexter crouches, pulls the photo from the slot, stares at it
as the picture FADES IN. Dexter reacts:
It's a photo of Dexter, moments ago, in the Captain's
, Quarters, standing over Tucci's bed. But something else gets
Dexter's attention. We don't see it... yet.
DISSOLVE TO:
[ EXT. DRY DOCK - NIGHT
Dexter watches EMTs wheel Tucci past on a stretcher.
LaGuerta follows. They get to Batista, entering the scene,
i
| LAGUERTA
I Angel. Thanks for coming in last
I minute. Doakes had this run-in
with Guerrero —
BATISTA
Shit. He all right?
LAGUERTA
It'll be a while before he gets
^•s back to heavy lifting at the gym.
I But he'll be fine. Meantime, I
just need you to run lead on this.
46.
\ BATISTA
You got it.
LAGUERTA
Hey... sorry to pull you out of
your anniversary. Your wife's not
gonna kill me, is she?
BATISTA
Nah, come on. She understands.
Married to the job first, right?
He heads off with a bright, reassuring smile just as Mrs.
Tucci comes through the nearby crowd, goes to her son. She
stops, her smile pasted on her face. Frozen. Tears form in
her eyes. LaGuerta seems caught, wanting to reach out...
The EMTs wheel them to the waiting ambulance, and LaGuerta
realizes she's facing a CROWD OF REPORTERS.
REPORTERS
Lieutenant!/Couple questions about
the rescue./Can Mr. Tucci identify
his attacker?
(**• LAGUERTA
What's important is that we
reunited Mr. Tucci and his family.
She smiles, moves to walk away. But then:
JOSH
Lieutenant. Please. Just the
basic details of what happened?
LaGuerta turns, thinks for a moment. Smiles. Demure.
LAGUERTA
Well, since you said please. At
eleven-fifteen this evening...
And as she continues to speak, we see a hint of
accomplishment in her eyes. Like she got exactly what she
wanted — they asked har to brief. ON JOSH, seeing it too...
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT
Deb walks past a GROUP OF UNIFORMS AND PLAINCLOTHES,
backslapping and congratulating a beaming McNamara: he took
down Guerrero, and he saved Sgt. Doakes in the process.
yffllrB ^
Deb turns, sees Doakes alone at his desk. His face is
bruised, his movements stiff. She approaches him.
//fl^-V
47.
DEBRA
Heard you were here. Aren't you
supposed to be home wrapping your
ribs or something?
SGT. DOAKES
Nothing broken. Paperwork won't
kill me. I'm strong like that.
DEBRA
Usually kills me.
SGT. DOAKES
(not looking up)
You did well in the briefing.
Impressive.
DEBRA
Thanks. That's my new thing. No
more men, no more friends. Gonna
bury myself in work from now on.
Only thing that doesn't bite back.
SGT. DOAKES
Are you still talking?
Captain Matthews approaches the celebration, hands a cigar to
McNamara, beaming, slapping him on the back...
DEBRA
You believe these guys? Dancing
around like they won Game Seven?
SGT. DOAKES
McNamara got Guerrero tonight.
He's earned the right to blow off
some steam.
DEBRA
(reading him)
Come on, Doakes. I get it.
SGT. DOAKES
Whatever "it" is, I'm pretty sure
you don't.
DEBRA
You feel conflicted. This guy
McNamara's been tormenting you for
weeks. Oh, don't look so
surprised, it's a police station,
people gossip.
48.
1 Doakes makes a show of ignoring her, but she goes on:
DEBRA
Then this same guy saves your life
and kills the guy who killed the
woman you love. You feel
conflicted.
SGT. DOAKES
Sure. Or maybe a week ago I buried
the woman I love. And all this
celebrating is fine, but she's
still in the ground. And I'm still
here alone.
He looks off toward McNamara and the others.
SGT. DOAKES
(quietly)
Nothing else matters.
As he turns back to his work, the conversation over, stay on
Deb for a beat watching him, his words and attitude impacting
her... surprising her.
("* EXT. DRY DOCK. - PARKING AREA - NIGHT
Dexter, surrounded by BLACK & WHITES and UNMARKED CARS. He
gets to his car, unlocks it — slips the Polaroid into his
pocket. As he shuts the door and drives off:
DEXTER (V.O.)
I've always been alone in this
world.
INT. RITA'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Rita enters, closes the door behind her. Takes off her coat.
Smiles. Wide. Unable to contain her newfound giddiness:
DEXTER (V.O.)
Connection is something meant for
other people. And it works for
them- It can mean finding strength
they didn't know they had...
INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT
Deb sits at her desk, distracted, watching Doakes move
stiffly about the office, keeping his pain inside.
y^nftftiv
49.
DEXTER (V.O.)
... or learning a secret about
someone they thought they knew.
EXT. DRY DOCK - MAKESHIFT PRESS AREA - NIGHT
DEXTER (V.O.)
They find connection in learning a
new way to reach people
LaGuerta speaks to the press, getting along swimmingly with
them... Josh watching her admiringly...
EXT. DRY DOCK - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
DEXTER (V.O.)
... and they fight to keep it, even
when it's slipping away...
Batista moves about the scene, issuing directives to
officers... no home to rush back to tonight...
INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dexter sits on the couch, staring intently at the Polaroid.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But it always eluded me.
ANGLE ON the Polaroid: Dexter with Tucci...
DEXTER (V.O.)
It was foolish of my playmate to
think I would turn my back on
Harry's code, something I could
never do. He obviously doesn't
know me as well as he thinks.
PUSH IN on the photo, the wall behind Dexter, a shiny BRASS
PLAQUE hanging just above the bed...
DEXTER (V.O.)
But still, he was reaching out to
me. A friend. Something I've
never had before.
PUSH IN on the reflection in the brass: a dark smudge,
featureless — but clearly a human face.
DEXTER
And for the first time in my life,
I feel excited. I feel connected.
50.
( "' The person in the photo holds a camera. It's our first view
of the ICE TRUCK KILLER.
DEXTER (V.O.)
And I feel like suddenly...
anything is possible.
OFF Dexter, staring at the photo, just breaking into a smile:
BLACK OUT.

DEXTER
“Truth Be Told”
FADE IN:
1 CLOSE ON DEXTER. Walking. Seemingly lost. RED STROBE 1
LIGHTS dance across his face, though we don’t see their
source.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I’ve never had much use for the
concept of hell. But if hell exists,
I’m in it.
REVEAL he walks toward a PARKING GARAGE. It’s a crime
scene... police tape, squad cars. But it’s all inexplicably
DESERTED, not a soul in sight.
DEXTER (V.O.)
The same images running through my
head. Over and over.
He enters the dark, silent garage. No one here, either.
Eyes fall to a trail on the ground of SMALL BLOOD DROPS.
QUICK FLASH: DEXTER’S MOTHER, sprayed in blood, held by a
LARGE, MENACING MAN.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I was there.
He comes to a LARGE, DRYING POOL OF BLOOD on the ground.
QUICK FLASH: Dexter’s mother COLLAPSING into the blood.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I saw my mother’s death.
He finds JAGGED BLOOD SMEARS on concrete pillars and an SUV.
QUICK FLASH: Blood spraying the walls, the sound of a
chainsaw hitting bone, Dexter’s mother SCREAMING.
DEXTER (V.O.)
A buried memory, forgotten all these
years... it climbed inside me that
day...
Dexter, shaken, looks up. Someone’s there.
DEXTER (V.O.)
And it’s been with me ever since... my
dark passenger.
REVEAL: BATISTA in a white hospital gown, blood seeping from
a DEEP KNIFE WOUND in his side, standing before Dexter.
Hurt. Accusatory.
BATISTA
You should be focusing on me, socio.
SLAM TO:
2 INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 1 - SAME TIME 2
We’ve been inside the parking garage Batista was stabbed in
Episode 110. Dexter stands right where he was. Same blood,
same crime scene. But now DEBRA’s where Batista stood. Midsentence.
Didn’t even know Dexter was in his own head.
DEBRA
-- seriously wanna take down the
motherfucker who did this to Batista.
(realizing)
Hey. You all right?
Dexter looks around. The area is fully populated, as it
should be: FORENSICS TECHS and UNIFORMS. As MASUKA,
forensics kit in hand, hurries up to them:
DEXTER
Yeah. I’m just... distraught. About
Angel.
(then)
How’s he doing? Do we know?
MASUKA
Still in surgery.
DEBRA
LaGuerta’s there. God, I hate feeling
so helpless.
(waiting, then, to
Masuka)
What, no jokes about providing gross,
sexual comfort in a time of crisis?
MASUKA
(matter-of-fact)
Our friend was stabbed, and he might
die.
A quiet, emotional beat. Moved, Debra reaches out and
wordlessly squeezes Masuka’s arm. ON DEXTER, watching...
DOAKES (O.S.)
Officer Morgan!
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 2.
CONTINUED:
Debra looks across the garage, sees DOAKES waving her over.
She hurries off. Masuka opens his kit.
MASUKA
Though her sweater melons do look
excellent tonight.
(re: the scene)
So what do you think?
They turn to the same series of JAGGED BLOOD SMEARS on the
concrete pillars and an SUV. Dexter stares.
DEXTER
He fought back. These jagged smears.
There was a struggle.
MASUKA
Attaboy, Angel.
Dexter’s eyes turn to the ground, where he focuses on the
SMALL BLOOD DROPS:
DEXTER
And here, this trail, the steady
stream of drops... he had a few
seconds. Tried moving away...
until...
Follow Dexter’s gaze to FIND the LARGE, DRYING POOL OF
BLOOD:
DEXTER
... until he fell.
Dexter stares at the abstract splotch, unable to turn away.
DEXTER (V.O.)
So much blood...
He looks up, sees everyone else moving about, doing their
jobs as if at HALF-SPEED. Comforting each other...
DEXTER (V.O.)
What’s happening to me?
ACROSS THE LOT
Debra and Doakes question the two roommates, ANDY and JERRY
(20s), who witnessed Batista’s attack.
JERRY
We heard the car alarm first. Then we
saw this guy with a knife.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 3.
2 CONTINUED: 2
DOAKES
You get a look at his face?
ANDY
Uh-uh. He wore some kind of a mask.
And he was fast. Took off as soon as
we ran over.
JERRY
What was this, like a carjacking?
Doakes looks around. He takes Debra aside.
DOAKES
Not likely. Not in an enclosed
parking garage.
DEBRA
But this guy was after something.
3 EXT. BUSY STREET CORNER - NIGHT 1 3
ON A PROSTHETIC HAND. Its nails painted different bright
colors, a UNIQUE DIAMOND RING on one finger. REVEAL
MONIQUE, the one-handed call girl from 110. She walks down
the well-populated street. On the job. Until:
MONIQUE
No way. You’re the one I’m supposed
to meet?
REVEAL RUDY has been waiting for her. He grins. Playful.
Just another guy meeting just another girl on the corner.
RUDY
In the flesh.
MONIQUE
Y’know, I was just talking to someone
about you.
(sly grin)
So... where’re we going?
4 INT. RUDY’S LOFT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 4
Monique, naked, on her stomach on the bed. Enjoying
herself. CLOSE ON RUDY, drawing lines on her body with a
surgical pen. He moves languidly, sensually -- it’s erotic.
MONIQUE
That tickles. Don’t stop.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 4.
2 CONTINUED: (2) 2
RUDY
I wouldn’t dream of stopping.
MONIQUE
You’re so different this time.
Gentle. I was afraid you were gonna
try and get all pervy with my stump
again.
RUDY
Actually, your imperfection is what
saved you the first time.
PULL UP. REVEAL what Monique cannot see -- Rudy marking her
arms and legs... at every major joint. For CUTS.
MONIQUE
Saved me from what?
RUDY
True artistry. The message of my work
isn’t in the product itself, but,
rather in its presentation.
He moves down her leg, making lines at all the right spots.
RUDY
And that wrinkled flesh hanging off
your radial carpal joint is far from
perfect. Quite unsightly, actually.
Stung, Monique sits up, her eyes flying open.
MONIQUE
Hey, if you’re gonna be an asshole --
RUDY
No, no, no, hey, shhhh.
He drops the pen, comes around her, massaging her shoulders.
RUDY
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend.
Monique looks like she wants to say something, but the
massage feels so good. She sinks into it...
RUDY
Truth is, I’m very grateful to you.
He slides his arms around her chest...
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 5.
4 CONTINUED: 4
RUDY
You’re my escape plan.
MONIQUE
Mmmmm. Escape from what?
RUDY
The police. Because of you, I’ve had
to speed up my project. I need
something that’ll distract them. And
I’ve found a freshly-chopped-up body
always does the trick.
MONIQUE
Wait... what?
Realizing she’s in trouble, she struggles, but he’s got one
arm around her neck, like a noose, clasped at the bicep by
the other. A grotesque, intimate hug. Too late for
Monique.
RUDY
Shh, don’t struggle. It never helps.
He leans his head next to hers, pressing her head sideways
at an awkward, unnatural angle.
RUDY
I’m compressing your carotid artery,
and that’s cutting off oxygen to your
brain. In about ten seconds, you’ll
be unconscious.
But Monique keeps squirming. Desperately fighting for air.
Then she SLUMPS FORWARD. Rudy catches her and hoists her
unconscious body over his shoulder.
5 INT. RUDY’S LOFT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 1 (CONTINUOUS) 5
Rudy carries Monique out of the bedroom and into the main
living area. Crossing to the kitchen, he pulls opens the
ominous silver door leading to his refrigerated KILL ROOM.
Rudy’s phone RINGS, but he doesn’t even give it a glance.
As Rudy pulls the heavy door shut behind him --
MATCH TO:
6 INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 1 6
The same RINGING. We’re with Debra in a waiting room.
She’s on her cell phone, and the ringing stops, replaced by:
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 6.
4 CONTINUED: (2) 4
RUDY’S VOICE
Hey, it’s Rudy! Leave a message.
DEBRA
(into phone)
Okay, I guess you went to bed. Or you
fell asleep on the couch watching Xena
reruns, which I still say makes you a
dork...
She turns, sees AURI, Batista’s daughter, sitting quietly
against the wall with a UNIFORM COP. Exhausted, worried.
Nearby, a HOSPITAL WORKER hangs festive, brightly-colored
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS, but Auri couldn’t care less.
DEBRA
Either way, call me when you get this.
Miss you.
PAN past a gathering of worried cops (uniformed and
civvies). FIND Dexter on his cell. Distracted.
DEXTER
He’s still in surgery. I don’t know
when we’ll hear anything.
INTERCUT WITH:
7 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 1 7
Rita, on her phone, replacing batteries in Astor and Cody’s
toys, can’t see Dexter’s not concentrating.
RITA
So you probably won’t be coming over
tonight.
DEXTER
Hmmm? No. I mean... I can’t.
RITA
I understand. You need to be there
for your friend.
(hesitating, then)
I haven’t told the kids yet.
DEXTER
Told them... about Angel?
RITA
About Paul. Being back in prison. I
hate breaking their hearts, they think
so much of their dad now...
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 7.
6 CONTINUED: 6
She gets no response from Dexter.
RITA
You know what, focus on Angel. We can
talk about this later.
DEXTER
Thanks.
(looking up)
They’re back. I have to go.
He hangs up and watches through the window as an unconscious
BATISTA is wheeled past, headed for his ICU room, followed
by a DOCTOR, LAGUERTA and NINA (Batista’s estranged wife).
LaGuerta splits off and joins the worried cops, gathered at
the window.
LAGUERTA
Angel sustained severe internal
injuries. Doctor said he lost a lot
of blood. But...
(tired smile)
The surgery was successful. Looks
like our boy’s out of the woods.
The room erupts with emotion: hugging, back slapping.
Relief all around. Debra fights back her own tears, and
Doakes puts his arm around her, letting her lean on him for
support.
Dexter stands apart from the cluster of cops.
DEXTER (V.O.)
I know I should stay. Be a part
of the group hug and the charade
that the good guys always win.
He turns to leave.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But I can’t focus. I’m trapped in the
clutches of a memory. I need to know
what it means.
Doakes’ look darkens as he watches Dexter quietly slip away.
8 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 1 8
ON DEXTER. Walking to the exit. Making his getaway. A
HAND lands on his shoulder, spins him around.
DOAKES
The fuck is wrong with you, Morgan?
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 8.
7 CONTINUED: 7
DEXTER
I have someplace to be.
DOAKES
Yeah, really? We all got someplace to
be. But you just found out a guy
who’s supposed to be your friend is
gonna live. That make you feel
anything? Anything at all?
Dexter stares back at Doakes. Dead calm.
DEXTER
Take your fucking hand off me.
A beat. Doakes stares intently into Dexter’s eyes -- and
sees the dark soul inside. Doakes slightly nods his head.
DOAKES
Yeah. Just what I always thought.
Doakes drops his hand. Dexter turns and walks away. OFF
Doakes, watching him go...
9 INT. RUDY’S LOFT - REFRIGERATED ROOM - NIGHT 1 9
PAN ACROSS dissected body parts on a menacing, elaborate
INVERSION TABLE. Some are wrapped in butcher’s paper.
Others with a single bright red bow. REVEAL Rudy in bloody
coveralls and Playtex gloves, admiring a job well done.
Pulling off his gloves, he picks up a prosthetic hand. It’s
clear this is all that’s left of Monique. Ready to discard
the hand, Rudy stops to consider its...
SPARKLING DIAMOND RING
Suddenly, a RED LIGHT mounted on the wall begins to blink,
indicating someone ringing his doorbell. He looks to a
small VIDEO SURVEILLANCE MONITOR -- there’s Debra outside
his front door. OFF Rudy, pocketing the ring...
10 EXT. RUDY’S LOFT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 1 10
Debra rings the bell again. Nothing. Then, just as she’s
about to go, the door opens. Sans coveralls and gloves,
Rudy pretends he was asleep.
RUDY
Hey.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 9.
8 CONTINUED: 8
DEBRA
I know it’s late. Guess you didn’t
get my message. I drove by and saw
your car. I can go.
RUDY
Get your ass in here. It’s about time
you see where I live anyway.
He playfully draws her into a hug.
DEBRA
You have no idea how much I needed
this. You feel good.
(beat)
And cold. You’re freezing.
RUDY
So stay and keep me warm.
11 INT. RUDY’S LOFT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 1 11
Debra takes in Rudy’s immaculate loft.
DEBRA
Wow. Fancy. I thought my brother was
a clean freak.
Rudy enters from the kitchen with wine and two glasses,
walking right past the silver door to his kill room.
RUDY
Hey, no talking about your brother,
right?
DEBRA
C’mon, I apologized for that. You can
hang out with Dex, I don’t give a
shit.
(realizing)
You guys are alike in a lot of ways.
RUDY
Maybe that’s why you love me so much.
He pours a glass for her. Takes in Debra’s solemn mood.
RUDY
This Batista thing really did a number
on you, didn’t it?
DEBRA
Angel’s daughter was there.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 10.
10 CONTINUED: 10
RUDY
That’s gotta be rough. The daughter
of a cop.
(beat)
Just like you.
Debra smiles. This guy completely gets her.
DEBRA
I remember what it’s like to kiss your
father goodbye, always afraid it might
be for the last time.
RUDY
You wanna get outta town for the
weekend? Just the two of us. We need
to talk.
DEBRA
Standing right here.
RUDY
Nope. The time has to be right.
DEBRA
O-kay. But it’ll have to wait. At
least until we find the asshole who
did this to Batista.
RUDY
Be warned, I can be very persistent.
(with each kiss)
I need to get out of town... and I
need you... to come with me.
Debra stops him before her resistance crumbles.
DEBRA
And what I need is sleep, which is not
gonna be easy. I’m totally wired from
all this shit.
RUDY
Then lucky for you I’ve got the
perfect cure. My lovin’ arms.
(pulls her into him)
And a little something to help you
sleep.
Debra eyes drift south.
DEBRA
That ain’t no little something, bub.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 11.
11 CONTINUED: 11
RUDY
I meant a valium. One of the perks of
working at a hospital.
DEBRA
Wine and valium? I’ll be completely
helpless.
RUDY
You read my mind.
12 INT. RUDY’S LOFT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 - LATER 12
FIND Debra sound asleep in bed, alone. PAN OVER. There’s
Rudy in the doorway. Fully-dressed. Watching her. After a
beat, he heads out. He has a job to do.
13 INT. POLICE STATION - FILE ROOM - DAY 2 (MORNING) 13
CAMILLIA, the file clerk from the pilot, is surprised to
look up from a sea of paperwork and find Dexter standing
there.
CAMILLIA
Well as I live and breathe.
DEXTER
Miss me?
CAMILLIA
You and those Bear Claws you’re hiding
behind your back.
Busted, Dexter puts a white pastry bag on top of her desk.
DEXTER
Couple of apple fritters, too.
CAMILLIA
This must be important. Haven’t seen
much of you lately.
DEXTER
No rest for the wicked. How’s Gene?
CAMILLIA
Good days and bad. He just finished
his first round of radiation. You and
Debra were sweet to send flowers while
he was in the hospital.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 12.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
DEXTER
He’s a good guy. Not much of a bridge
player, though.
CAMILLIA
(laughs)
Harry and Gene used to get so mad
every time Doris and I took them to
the cleaners.
DEXTER
Think you can dig up an old case file
for me?
CAMILLIA
Sure thing. Got a date?
DEXTER
Not exactly. It’s the crime scene
where Harry found me.
Camillia shifts. Uncomfortable with the request.
CAMILLIA
Wish I could help, but everything from
that long ago is boxed up in the
basement of City Hall. And as you can
see, I’m up to my you-know-what in
year-end reports.
Dexter’s cell phone RINGS. He checks to see who it is.
DEXTER
That’s my Lieutenant. Camillia, is
there anything you remember --
CAMILLIA
What I remember, Dexter Morgan, is
your father caring enough to bring you
into his home and give you a loving
family.
(beat)
I wouldn’t keep your Lieutenant
waiting.
She buries her head back into her paperwork and Dexter has
no choice but to turn and leave empty-handed.
14 EXT. SANTA’S COTTAGE - SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY 2 (MORNING) 14
FOLLOW machine-generated snowflakes as they waft to the
ground, bringing us to UNIFORMS unspooling police tape
around the festive setting of Santa’s Cottage.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 13.
13 CONTINUED: 13
FIND Doakes and Debra interviewing two distraught ELFS
(Little People, 40s).
DOAKES
Who found the body parts?
MALE ELF
I did. They were left under the tree.
I thought the crew from last night was
messing with us... until I saw the

FEMALE ELF
I told him not to touch anything but
he never listens.
MALE ELF
God, Patty, do you have to be such a
bitch?
DEBRA
You guys see or hear anything out of
the ordinary? Before you found the
body?
FEMALE ELF
There was a broken window by the
door... who’d do something like this
so close to Christmas?
MALE ELF
The Grinch?
FEMALE ELF
You’re a fucking riot, Max. Like
anyone’s gonna shop down here after
this. There go our jobs.
Doakes and Debra share a look and pull away.
DOAKES
Thanks for your cooperation.
DEBRA
Sucks to be an elf.
Debra fights off a yawn.
DOAKES
Not enough sleep?
DEBRA
Too much. I’ll be good with some
coffee.

LAGUERTA
Canvass parking lots, ATMs, shops --
any place with a security camera.
Let’s get some visual surveillance.
As the Uniforms break off, Dexter arrives at the crime scene
with his blood kit.
DEXTER
Got here as fast as I could. What’re
we looking at?
LAGUERTA
Female victim. Cut up into pieces.
DEXTER
(surprised)
The Ice Truck Killer? So soon?
LAGUERTA
Yeah. After the bloodbath at the
hotel, can’t wait to see how the
Captain handles the press on this one.
LaGuerta spots Doakes and Debra nearby.
LAGUERTA
James! Walk Dexter here through the
crime scene.
She crosses away. Calling out...
LAGUERTA
And will someone turn off the goddamn
snow machine?
Dexter walks up to Debra and Doakes, who glares at Dexter.
DOAKES
Your sister can handle this.
As Doakes moves off, he bumps Dexter’s shoulder. Hard.
Debra notices the look he gives her brother.
DEBRA
That a whole sexual tension thing or
did I miss something?

Ignoring her, Dexter follows Debra over to the ersatz winter
wonderland. She points to a clock on the wall of Santa’s
Cottage. Its candy cane hands are frozen at:
DEBRA
1:03. Same numbers he left at the
Marina View Hotel.
DEXTER
Any leads on what they mean?
DEBRA
We’ve talked to numerologists.
Mathematicians. Code-breakers. They
need more to go on.
Passing by Santa’s over-sized velvet throne, Dexter is drawn
to an enormous glittering tree. UNDER THE TREE lies an
assortment of gifts wrapped in colorful paper, ribbons and
bows. At first we don’t see a body. But as he comes
closer:
DEXTER’S POV
reveals that some of those ribbons adorn wrapped BODY PARTS
nestled among the gifts... including Monique’s head. Her
face finally at peace.
DEXTER (V.O.)
First he turns my whole world inside
out with a carnival of blood.
QUICK FLASH: Staccato CUTS of the blood-splashed walls,
floors and ceiling of Room 103 (Episode 110). Dexter
falling down in the blood.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Now he leaves me this? A calming
oasis in my desert of confusion? It
doesn’t make sense.
Dexter crouches beside Masuka to examine the body.
MASUKA
Crime scene’s wiped clean.
DEBRA
Another hooker?
MASUKA
Ho, ho, dead ho. Hey Morgan, wanna
sit on my lap when we’re done and tell
me what you want for Christmas?

14 CONTINUED: (3) 14
DEBRA
And he’s back. No thanks. Last thing
on my wish list is a burning sensation
when I pee.
DEXTER
This isn’t right. The way the body
parts are scattered among the
presents. The broken window.
(looks up at Debra)
It’s not his usual style. The Ice
Truck Killer is meticulous. But this
seems rushed. Haphazard.
MASUKA
That’d explain why we can’t find one
of the hands.
Dexter cocks his head. Peers at the torso.
DEBRA
What’s wrong?
DEXTER
The victim’s torso. Something’s under
it.
Masuka carefully rotates the wrapped torso. REVEAL tied to
the woman’s spine with ribbon is a VIDEOTAPE.
DEXTER
Merry Christmas, Miami.

Debra sees CAPTAIN MATTHEWS pushing his way through the
press.
DEBRA
Shit. Here comes Brass. Meet me
there. I need to talk to you.
ANGLE ON Matthews dodging a REPORTER (Female, 30s).
REPORTER
Sir, after all this time, why do you
think the Ice Truck Killer has struck
again?
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Any answer would be pure speculation
on my part.
REPORTER
Do you think it has any connection
with your department’s handling of the
Neil Perry fiasco?
Ignoring the question, Matthews ducks under the police tape,
joining his officers as the tape begins to play.
ON SCREEN: Monique’s terrified face appears in CLOSE UP.
Choking back tears, she begins to read a chilling, prepared
message to Miami Metro.
MONIQUE
You arrested the wrong man. Made the
world think I’m a rank amateur.
Crying now, she tries desperately to get the words out...
MONIQUE
And I’m very, very angry.

DEBRA
Look at the tears. They’re rolling
up.
LAGUERTA
My God...
MASUKA
Bastard’s got her upside down.
DEXTER
It’s how he bleeds them out.
Stringing them up like meat.
LaGuerta nods to the Tech to resume the tape. ON SCREEN
Monique continues...
MONIQUE
To answer for your mistakes... someone
must pay.
Monique’s eyes widen. Realizing her fate.
MONIQUE
Oh God... please... no...
Suddenly a dark figure fills FRAME, obscuring our view. We
hear Monique pleading for her life, a soft GURGLING SOUND,
then... eerie silence.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Turn it off.
LAGUERTA
I’ll have the tape sent back to the
station for analysis.
Matthews ignores her, turning to...
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Sergeant Doakes, you’re on point.

CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Not anymore.
(eyeing LaGuerta)
Fact is we still haven’t caught this
guy and now he’s rubbing our noses in
it. It’s time for fresh ideas.
LAGUERTA
And what would you like me to do?
(pointed)
Captain.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Detectives Batista’s a good man.
Deserves justice. Let’s find out who
stabbed him.
As Matthews strides off, Doakes pulls LaGuerta aside.
DOAKES
This shit ain’t right. I’ll go talk
to him.
LAGUERTA
No. Do as he says. The Commissioner
has Matthews’ ass in a sling. There’s
a review tomorrow. Word is he’s
getting the boot.
DOAKES
So, what, you’re just gonna sit back

LAGUERTA
If it means being seen as his worthy

CODY
Where is he?
Rita closes the front door. Reluctant to deliver the
heartbreaking news.
RITA
He’s... well he’s...
ASTOR
He’s back in jail, isn’t he?
RITA
I know he really wanted to say
goodbye, but there wasn’t any time.
He loves you both so much.
ASTOR
I forgot my math book.
Astor exits, leaving Rita with Cody, who idolized his
father.
RITA
I’m sure he’d want to hear from you.
We could write him a letter.

DEBRA
So we could talk about Rudy. He’s
been acting weird lately.
DEXTER
Think he’s cheating?
DEBRA
Don’t be retarded. Things have been
awesome between us. Then last night
he tells me ‘we need to talk.’
DEXTER
That’s never good.
DEBRA
Thanks. I feel much better now. I’ve
only been obsessing over it all day.
You ever get something in your head
you just can’t shake?
DEXTER
Not really.
DEBRA
Lucky you.
(beat)
Think you can talk to him for me?
She starts waving across the patio. As Dexter turns, he
sees Rudy working his way toward them. Dexter feigns
surprise.
DEXTER
Oh look. It’s Rudy.
DEBRA
I sorta called him.
Debra gives Rudy a kiss as he takes a seat.
RUDY
Hey, Dex. Deb didn’t mention you’d be
joining us.

Apparently she’s had a lot on her
mind.
Glancing at her cell phone, Debra pretends to get a page.
DEBRA
Shit. That’s work. I gotta go.
She kisses Rudy. Slides her tray in front of him.
DEBRA
Here, have mine. Sorry.
Behind Rudy’s back, Debra flashes the ‘call me’ sign to
Dexter as she goes, leaving her brother and Rudy staring at
each other. This is the last place Dexter wants to be with
absolutely no idea how to honor Debra’s request. Attempting
small talk, he notes the cut on Rudy’s lip.
DEXTER
Deb catch you with her right hook?
She can be very protective of the
remote.
RUDY
Little workshop accident this morning.
Dexter can’t help but notice...
DEXTER
Doesn’t look like it happened this
morning. Cut’s already closing up.
RUDY
(back pedaling)
Did I say... I meant yesterday
morning. Guess I’ve been working too
hard. Anyway, something tells me my
lip isn’t why Debra arranged this
little chat.
Grateful for Rudy’s bluntness, Dexter returns the favor.
DEXTER
My sister’s afraid there might be
trouble in paradise.
RUDY
Your sister’s wrong.

So, this “need to talk” thing...

rest of my life with, you know?
DEXTER
Don’t know. But here’s what I do
know: Deb’s fallen hard for you. Hurt
her...
RUDY

DEXTER
Something like that.

Ooh, scary.
They both smile and then dig in for lunch.

NINA
I’ll get the doctor.
As Nina exits, Batista tries to sit up.
LAGUERTA
I wouldn’t --
Ouch. Still sedated and in a lot of pain, Batista lies back
down as Laguerta crosses to him.
LAGUERTA
Doctors said you’re lucky to be alive.
And still have a liver.
BATISTA
That’s why we got two, right?
LAGUERTA
Good thing you decided to be a cop.
BATISTA
Tell me you caught the cocksucker who
ruined one of my best shirts.
LaGuerta sits on the side of his bed. Asking gently...
LAGUERTA
We don’t have any leads. The men who
found you said your attacker was
wearing a mask. Did you see anything?
BATISTA
No... he was behind me... I felt the
blade go in... happened so fast...
It’s a painful memory and he switches gears.
BATISTA
Has Nina been here long?
LAGUERTA
She was the first one to the hospital.
Hasn’t left your side the whole time.

RUDY
Cute kid.

You in there, Dex?
DEXTER
Sorry. Can’t stop thinking about a
cold case of mine. I’ve hit this dead
end.
RUDY
Well, if you’re anything like your
sister, I’m sure you’ll keep digging.
When Deb called this morning she said
something about you guys being on a
crime scene near here.
DEXTER
Ice Truck Killer strikes again.
RUDY
No shit. Think you’ll catch him?
DEXTER
He’s smart, but he’s taking chances.
Means we’re getting close. His kill
this morning felt like a smoke screen.
Rudy can’t believe Dexter figured that out. He uses the
opportunity to feel out Dexter on the subject
RUDY
Ever wonder what makes someone do
things like that?
DEXTER
Not my job.
RUDY
But you gotta be curious. C’mon, if
you could talk to him... what would
you say?

Well, good luck. I hope you find what

Dexter stares intently at the blotched fabric.
DEXTER (V.O.)
My mother was murdered before my eyes.
Makes sense I’d choose a life where I
search for meaning in blood...
Dexter’s gloved hand glides over a jagged tear indicating
where the knife went in.
DEXTER (V.O.)
...because the sole memory I have of
her is being covered in it. I need to
know more details.
LAGUERTA’S VOICE
I hope that look means you found
something.
Jarred from his own thoughts, Dexter glances up to see
LaGuerta standing in the doorway.
DEXTER
You should see this.
As LaGuerta comes closer, Dexter points to a TINY BLOOD DROP
on the back of the shirt’s collar.
LAGUERTA
That’s what I drove all the way back
from the hospital for?
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 27.

DEXTER
This drop doesn’t match the wound
pattern or spatter on the rest of
Batista’s shirt. And look where it
is, inside the back of his collar.
LAGUERTA
Angel was stabbed from behind. You
think it’s the attacker’s blood?
DEXTER
We know Batista fought back.
LAGUERTA
Run the DNA. If this guy has priors,
we may get a hit on our database.
DEXTER
Already sent off a sample.
LAGUERTA
(glances at watch)
First thing in the morning I want you
at the hospital. Check the back of
Batista’s head for a matching wound...
Dexter watches as LaGuerta’s attention momentarily drifts
through his lab window and out into the bullpen.
LAGUERTA
...he’s still pretty out of it.
REVEAL what LaGuerta is looking at through the window:
Doakes leading an Ice Truck Killer briefing with a gathering
of cops and detectives.
DEXTER
Sorry to hear. You know, Matthews
taking you off the case and all.

Killer’s manifesto on a monitor...
MONIQUE
You arrested the wrong man. Made the
world think I’m a rank amateur. And
I’m very, very angry.
DEBRA
I can’t watch this again.
Doakes FREEZES the harrowing image.
DOAKES
I know this is tough, but keep your
eyes on the monitor.
He points the remote and the tape FAST FORWARDS. It’s a sea
of BLACK until there’s a brief flash. REWINDING the tape,
Doakes then advances it in SLO-MO.
DEBRA
What was that?
DOAKES
Masuka went through this frame-byframe.
The camera tilts up right
before he hits the off switch. Watch.
On screen, the camera SHAKES as it’s grabbed and momentarily
TILTED UP toward the ceiling, capturing the call girl on the
same inversion table we saw earlier at Rudy’s, her feet in
gravity boots. PAUSE. Doakes points to the monitor: above
the woman’s feet, embedded in the ceiling, is a LARGE
COOLING UNIT.
DOAKES
That, my friends, is a monster
refrigeration unit.
DETECTIVE SIMMS
He needs it cold to preserve the
bodies. We knew that.
MASUKA
But check how much space there is
between her feet and the ceiling.
This room is way bigger than your
standard commercial freezer. Most
likely it was a custom build.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 29.
DETECTIVE SIMMS
So we should focus our search on
commercial districts.
Debra considers that -- and then it hits her.
DEBRA
No, residential.
DOAKES
You think he built this in his place?
DEBRA
He picks up hookers, right? I worked
Vice, and the smart girls know you
don’t go anywhere near a factory or
warehouse unless you never want to be
seen again.
DETECTIVE SIMMS
Kind of a stretch. How do we know he
didn’t knock out his victims or drug
‘em? Then take ‘em to a warehouse.
DEBRA
None of the victims showed any sign of
head trauma. Or narcotics. Besides,
what better way to trap a victim than
get her to walk into your own home?
Inspired, Debra crosses to a map of Miami. Points to a site
with a pin.
DEBRA
The victim’s escort service said she
was meeting her client at Brickell
Avenue and Coral Way.
(points to another pin)
And she was found at Santa’s Cottage,
which is at the mall on Biscayne.
DOAKES
We’ll map out grids. Focus on private
residences drawing large amounts of
power near those areas. We catch a

Unless I should know. Should I? Okay
tell me.

DEBRA
No don’t. “We need to talk.” Who
says that unless they’re dumping you,
right?

I don’t think that’s what --
DEBRA
He probably wants me out on the water
in case I make a scene. This always

DEXTER (V.O.)
I was never one to dwell on my past.
Always content to leave it a mystery.
No details. Just a blur of images,
rushing by. But my friend out there
wants to bring those memories into
focus.
He slows down the microfilm to read a headline: “MOB HIT
KILLS TWO.” Skimming the article, Dexter shakes his head.
No, that’s not it. He continues his search.
DEXTER (V.O.)
So do I.
A LIBRARY AIDE (black, 30s) crosses to Dexter. Hands him a
few more boxes.
LIBRARY AIDE
This is it for the Metro News for 1972
through 1973. The Tribune’s archives
only go back as far as 1976.

Thank you.
As the woman leaves, Dexter flips to the next front-page
headline.

ON SCREEN grisly images of a crime scene are splashed across
a story dated October 3rd, 1973. The bold headline reads:
“SHIPPING YARD MASSACRE.” Its sub-headline: “Authorities
discover grisly bloodbath.”
Next to other crossed out dates, Dexter jots down: 10-3-73.
A beat. He crosses out the last two digits.
DEXTER (V.O.)
10-3.
Then, removing the dash between the 0 and 3, the realization
is staggering...
DEXTER (V.O.)
One, zero, three. Same as the hotel.
Same as Santa’s cottage. This is what
he wanted me to find all along.
Dexter advances the microfilm to the newspaper’s MUGSHOT
PHOTOS of TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN. One is now a hauntingly
familiar face. Her name escapes his lips...
DEXTER
Laura Moser... my mother.
He moves on to another page. A black and white photo
disguises the gruesome nature of a hacked up woman’s body,
face down, in a vast, dark pool of blood.
DEXTER (V.O.)
No wonder I’ve felt so disconnected my
entire life. Because if I did have
emotions, I’d have to feel... this.

That’s kind of odd, don’t you think?
She takes a deep drag off her cigarette.
CAMILLIA

To protect you.
Camillia puts down the hose. Crossing to turn it off.

RITA
I’ve looked everywhere.
DEXTER
Call the police. I’m on my way.
He hangs up and urgently turns to Camillia.
DEXTER
Camillia, I need to know the truth.
CAMILLIA
Kid...
She looks into his eyes. He can see the fear.
CAMILLIA
... leave this one alone.
(beat)
I have to get changed for work.
OFF Dexter, watching her go. Needing to know more...

27 INT. RITA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 3 (MORNING) 27
Distraught, Rita sits with Dexter on the couch, Astor curled
up by her mother’s side.
RITA
I can’t wait here like this. I have
to do something.
DEXTER
The officer said you need to stay home
in case Cody comes back. The
neighbors are helping look. We’ll
find him.
RITA
One squad car for all of Miami? What
if some crazy person picked him up off
the street?
Astor sits up. Fighting back tears.
ASTOR
Mommy, it’s my fault.
RITA
Honey, what’re you talking about?
ASTOR
I should’ve heard Cody get out of bed.
I’m his big sister.
RITA
Look at me, this is not your fault,
okay?
Sniffling, Astor nods.
RITA
Now, do you think you can get Dexter
some water, please?
Astor gets up, crossing away.
RITA
Why didn’t I see this coming? Cody
was so angry with me about Paul
getting sent back to jail.
DEXTER
Paul... Today’s Thursday, right?
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 36.
RITA
(so?)
Yeah...?
DEXTER
I think I know where Cody is.
28 EXT. PARK - DAY 3 (MORNING) 28
Cody sits alone on a swing, gently twisting side to side.
RITA’S VOICE
Need a push?
The boy turns to see Rita, Dexter and Astor. Crossing to
her son, Rita kneels in front of the heartbroken boy, who
won’t look at her.
RITA
Today’s the day you’d meet Daddy in
the park, huh?
CODY
He’ll be here.
RITA
Baby, I’m so sorry, but he’s not
coming back. Not for a long time.
(off his silence)
We’ll talk about this when we get
home, okay?
Rita hugs her son, who still won’t acknowledge her.
DEXTER (V.O.)
After all the lies Harry left for me
to uncover, I’d love to run away, too.
Rita stands and walks to Dexter. Behind her, Astor steps up
to her brother.
ASTOR
I’ll give you a push.
As Astor pushes Cody, Rita talks quietly with Dexter.
RITA
He won’t even look at me. I’m not the
one in jail, but I’m still the bad
guy.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 37.
27 CONTINUED: 27
DEXTER
Are you really surprised? You didn’t
tell them the truth about their
father.
RITA
(taken aback)
I told them Paul’s back in jail.
DEXTER
You told them where he is, not who he
is. Their dad is still the same wifebeating,
drug-using redneck he always
was, and they should hear that.
RITA
You’re not a parent -- you don’t
understand. You do anything to
protect your kids.
DEXTER
Rita, wake up. You’re not protecting
them, you’re protecting Paul.
Rita is stung by the criticism.
RITA
I need to get them home.
OFF Dexter, watching Rita gather up her kids...
29 INT. POLICE STATION - KITCHEN - DAY 3 (MORNING) 29
LaGuerta forages through a cabinet. Doakes steps up beside
her. She chooses a candy bar.
DOAKES
Chocolate for breakfast? Somebody’s
in a good mood.
LAGUERTA
The Commissioner and the review board
did not look happy when they got here.
They’ve been up in Matthews’ office
for two hours.
DOAKES
You thinkin’ his ass is about three
shades of red right now?
LaGuerta exits the kitchen into the hallway, followed by
Doakes.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 38.
28 CONTINUED: 28
LAGUERTA
I don’t care what color it is as long
as it’s on its way out the door.
Suddenly, Matthews exits his office with a group of GRAYING
WHITE GUYS in suits. But it’s smiles all around, laughter
and back slaps as they head for elevators. Looking back
over his shoulder, Matthews and LaGuerta make eye contact,
before he’s swept away by the good ‘ol boys.
LAGUERTA
Tell me that did not just happen.
DOAKES
It’s who you know and who you blow.
LAGUERTA
They’re probably booking their fucking
tee time.
DOAKES
Watch your back. He’s gonna be
gunnin’ for you more than ever.
Trying not to seem worried, LaGuerta hands Doakes the candy
bar, heading back to her office.
LAGUERTA
Let him try.
30 INT. HOSPITAL - BATISTA’S ROOM - DAY 3 30
Dexter pops his head into Batista’s room.
DEXTER
Someone request more Jell-o?
BATISTA
(laughs, winces)
Oh man, don’t... stitches.
As Dexter enters, Nina rises from her chair.
NINA
I’ve got to check with the sitter. If
he even tries to get out of that bed,
there’s mace in my purse.
BATISTA
She’s lying. She’s just embarrassed
to use the bathroom in front of you.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 39.
29 CONTINUED: 29
NINA
No seas payaso. <Would you stop.>
BATISTA
Me gusta cuando te pones caliente. <I
like it when you’re feisty.>
Nina exits, smiling at Batista.
DEXTER
Feelin’ better?
BATISTA
Ask me when they take this out...
(holds up I.V.)
...’cause whatever this shit is, it’s
good. Just makes me sleepy.
DEXTER
This won’t take long. There was a
drop of blood on your shirt that
wasn’t yours, so...
He pulls on a pair of rubber gloves.
DEXTER
...I want to check the back of your
head.
BATISTA
Just as long as it’s only my head
you’re checkin’ back there, bro.
Batista leans forward, allowing Dexter to examine his scalp.
BATISTA
You see that? Nina and I haven’t
gotten along this well in years.
Dexter remains silent as he pokes around. A beat.
BATISTA
How’re things with you and Rita?
DEXTER
Not so good. We kinda had some words
this morning. I think I really upset
her.
BATISTA
That’s rough, man.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 40.
30 CONTINUED: 30
DEXTER
Maybe I’m not the right person for
her. Some people are meant to be
alone, right?
BATISTA
Dex, socio, alone sucks. All this
time away from Nina, now I got a real
shot to have it back...
(in pain)
...hijo de perra!
DEXTER
Sorry. Teeth marks. You definitely
wounded this guy.
BATISTA
Good. Hope I broke his fuckin’ nose,
or at least gave him a fat lip.
Dexter is caught off-guard. A dawning whisper...
DEXTER
Fat lip?
(beat)
Angel, have you ever met Deb’s
boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?
BATISTA
I swung by his office a couple days
ago. Nice guy. Why?
OFF Dexter, the impossible racing through his head...
31 INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY 3 31
On a mission, Dexter makes his way down a hospital corridor,
motoring past a VISITOR with a plant. No one else matters.
DEXTER (V.O.)
At lunch, Rudy said he’d hurt his lip
that morning. He was lying. And I was
too distracted to care.
Dexter rounds the corner of the corridor...
DEXTER (V.O.)
But he’s got my full attention now.
And he’s gone.

32 INT. PRISON - VISITING ROOM - DAY 3 32
Handcuffed to his waist and sitting alone at a table, Paul
looks haggard and weak from the throes of detox. Glancing
up, he’s surprised to see Rita enter.
PAUL
You gotta be kiddin’ me.
RITA
How are you?
PAUL
How the hell do I look? I can barely
remember how I got here.
She sits down across from him.
RITA
There’s something we need to discuss.
PAUL
If you’re here for an apology,
sweetheart, you wasted a tank of gas.
Paul gets up from table.
RITA
Sit. I’m not finished.
PAUL
Fuck you.
RITA
Astor and Cody are in the other room.
PAUL
(stops dead)
Jesus, you brought them here?
RITA
I know this will be difficult, but you
need to tell them why you’re in this
place.
PAUL
I have no fucking idea why I’m in this
place.
RITA
Goddammit, Paul. This isn’t about
you.
(getting up)
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 42.
(MORE)
Fine, if you want to be in denial, go
ahead. You’ll never see your kids
again.
PAUL
Wait! I can’t just... I fought so
hard to win them back. Especially
Astor. They see me like this, I lose
them forever.
RITA
Paul, the one good thing that came out
of our marriage are these kids. And I
know you love them. But if you want
to have any kind of real relationship
with them, it has to be with the
father they have, not the father they
wish they had.
PAUL
I can’t believe you’re doing this.
You really do hate me as much as I
loved you.
RITA
I used to hate you. But I won’t give
you that kind of control over my life
anymore. You cheated on me. Broke my
heart. My bones. And I took it all
so the kids wouldn’t have to. Now,
I’m giving you a chance to make all
that right. Not for me. For them.
Paul looks down. Unable to face Rita.
PAUL
I wouldn’t even know what to say.
RITA
Tell them you’re in here paying for
your mistakes. That’s a valuable
lesson. It’s one you never got.
Rita gets up from the table. Crossing to the door.
RITA
What’s it going to be?
Ever so slightly... he nods. Rita opens the door. OFF Cody
and Astor running into the waiting arms of their father...

33 INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 3 33
Dexter enters with a sense of purpose, looking for Debra.
Doesn’t notice the crush of activity -- grids on the wall
denoting power usage, officers and detectives studying Miami
maps. Finds Debra across the room, heads straight for her.
DEXTER
Are you here tonight?
DEBRA
(beyond bummed)
We’re tits-deep in the Ice Truck
Killer. Might be on to something.
It’s gonna be an all-nighter.
DEXTER
So that text message you got from
Rudy? About going away with him?
You’re not gonna do that, right?
DEBRA
Tragically, no. I was all psyched to
meet him at the Miami Beach Marina,
but this bullpen’s my home till we
finish this.
DEXTER
Good.
He turns to go, in a hurry, but stops when she answers:
DEBRA
Good? I’m working on a theory that
Rudy was going to pop the question and
now he can’t. Why’s it good?
DEXTER
(covering)
No, I meant... good that you’re making
progress here.
DEBRA
Oh. Yeah. We’re getting closer.
DEXTER
Fingers crossed.
She goes back to work. He watches for a beat.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 44.
DEXTER (V.O.)
At least I know my sister is safe
tonight. Which gives me time to check
out my own theory on Rudy.
He turns, walking from the bullpen.
34 INT. HOSPITAL - BATISTA’S ROOM - DAY 3 34
Nina enters cheerfully, magazines in hand.
NINA
They didn’t have Road & Track, so --
She pulls up short when she sees UNIFORMED OFFICER WONG, 25,
handing Batista a GREASY FAST-FOOD BAG. Her eyes narrow.
NINA
That better be a bag of applesauce.
BATISTA
Okay, Wong, at this point you probably
wanna go save yourself.
Wong practically flies out the door. Nina walks to the bed.
BATISTA
Reina, don’t be mad, I was just --
NINA
(looking in the bag)
You’ve gotta be kidding me, two
Doublemeats? And curly fries?
BATISTA
Man’s gotta eat.
(grins)
Aw. You’re cute when you’re annoyed.
Your lips form this little “O” --
NINA
Goddammit, Angel, do I look like I’m
being fucking cute with you?
BATISTA
Well... not now you don’t, no.
NINA
You always do this. You always make
light of things that matter.
Angel smiles, reaching out a hand, drawing a reluctant (and
still-pissed) Nina close to his side.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 45.
33 CONTINUED: 33
BATISTA
Hey, I’m sorry. Tell you what, when I
come home, I’ll eat whatever you want.
No joking, no complaining. I promise.
NINA
(gently pulls her hand)
When you... come home?
BATISTA
Well, yeah. I just thought... the way
things were going with us... I thought
maybe you’d forgiven me.
Nina’s face softens, she looks at Angel compassionately.
NINA
Of course I forgive you. I forgave
you a long time ago.
BATISTA
So... let’s fix this. Look, we got a
second chance here.
NINA
(hating this)
Papi, you did what you did, and it was
hard, but it got us to face the truth:
we were miserable. For years. You
really wanna survive this and go right
back to being unhappy?
BATISTA
Maybe. What if I do?
She leans in, tenderly stroking Batista’s forehead.
NINA
You’ll always be Auri’s father. I
will always care about you. And I’ll
always be here for you.
(brave smile)
But our marriage is over.
OFF Angel, hiding his heartbreak...
35 INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY 3 35

Good. We’ll start canvassing tonight.
Why don’t you take --

display, hesitates.
DOAKES
That him?
DEBRA
Yeah. How’d you know?
DOAKES
You got that dumbass smile on your
face again.

Well, go on. Answer it.
She opens the phone. Speaks softly into it.

36 EXT. MARINA - YACHT - DAY 3 36
Rudy on the deck of a small yacht.
RUDY
Hey, Super Cop. What’s the word?
DEBRA
I’m sort of in a thing right now --
RUDY
Gotcha. I’ll be quick. You didn’t
answer my text. Do I get the
pleasure of your company this
weekend?
Rudy strings playful patio lights across the deck, clearly
preparing for company.
DEBRA
Yeah, about that...
RUDY
Deb, come on, it’s only two days.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 47.
35 CONTINUED: 35
DEBRA
I know, I know, it’s just -- we think
we have a major break in the Ice Truck
Killer case.
Rudy silently RAGES.
DEBRA
I promise when we catch this douche
bag, you and I are gonna spend a whole
week in bed. You’re not gonna be able
to get rid of me.
Rudy calms down, regroups. Tries another approach:
RUDY
Okay, well... what about dinner?
DEBRA
Oh my god, you are persistent.
RUDY
You have to eat, right? So come eat
with me tonight...
(playing a card)
... on this yacht I’m on.
DEBRA
I’m sorry. Did you say yacht?
DOAKES
Morgan. Today?
DEBRA
Yeah, hang on.
(to Rudy)
Where the hell did you get a yacht?
RUDY
Rented it. I was hoping for a nice
weekend, but we can still have a nice
night. And there is that thing we
need to talk about.
Debra grins despite herself -- her proposal theory is
bearing fruit. After a beat:
DEBRA
All right, listen... maybe I can take
an hour for dinner tonight.
RUDY
I can work with an hour.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 48.
36 CONTINUED: 36
DEBRA
I mean a real hour. Not one of your
let’s-stretch-this-till-2-am-and-thenyou-might-as-well-stay-and-have-sex
hours.
RUDY
Right. Real hour. No fake hours.
Got it.
DEBRA
I’ll get out of here as fast as I
can. See you soon.
She hangs up and turns back to Doakes. ON RUDY, a small
contented smile on his face as he strings up more lights...

38 INT. POLICE STATION - LAGUERTA’S OFFICE - NIGHT 3 38
At her desk, LaGuerta looks up as Matthews opens the door
and, without asking, enters, crossing to sit across from
her.
LAGUERTA
Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please
come in.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Maria, let’s have a talk.
LAGUERTA
(no time to banter now)
Look, congratulations on your review,
I heard it went well, you must be
thrilled, but now, if you don’t mind --
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
I’ll get to the point. All our
missteps the last few months, failure
to bring in the Ice Truck Killer,
mishandling Tony Tucci, even Neil
Perry --
LAGUERTA
Perry was your fuck-up, not mine.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
-- were all a result of bad command
structure. And that’s my failure.

36 CONTINUED: (2) 36
LAGUERTA
(surprised by his candor)
Oh. Well, I’m glad to hear you say
that. It takes a big man to admit his
own mistakes.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
So, this morning, the Commissioner
gave me the go-ahead to restructure
the division. Effective immediately,
you will no longer serve as my
lieutenant.
A tense, unpleasant beat. Then... LaGuerta LAUGHS.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
I’m sorry. This must be difficult.
LAGUERTA
Please. It’s ridiculous. You really
don’t want to do this.
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Because of your status in the Cuban
community.
LAGUERTA
I’m a fucking hero to this community.
If you think they’ll just accept --
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
Your replacement’s already picked.
Esmee Pascal. Transfer from Ft.
Lauderdale. Real up-and-comer.
LaGuerta sits back. Uh-oh.
LAGUERTA
Pascal? Haitian-American, shot in the
line of duty last year?
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
(smiling)
Turns out she’s an actual hero.
LAGUERTA
You think I’m going to stay quiet for
this?
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
(quietly)
I did warn you, Maria.

I’ll need you to clear out this office

He gets up and moves to the door. The victor.
LAGUERTA
Expect a call from the union rep!
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
If you want it, you’ll always have a
place in the bullpen.
LAGUERTA
And my lawyer!
CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
With the other detectives.
LAGUERTA
This isn’t fucking over!
But he’s out the door.
LAGUERTA
God dammit!
OFF LaGuerta, fuming...
39 INT. RUDY’S LOFT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 3 39
Dexter steps to the door, gloves on. Stealth mode.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Thinking Rudy attacked Batista doesn’t
make any sense. He’s a loving
boyfriend. He spends his life helping
people in need. He brought me steaks.
A quick look around, makes sure he’s alone -- then he pulls
his lock-pick tools from the messenger bag over his
shoulder. But he stops short. COME AROUND, REVEAL a heavyduty
deadbolt sunken into a thick, steel plate.
DEXTER (V.O.)
That’s just... rude.
It’s impenetrable. He stands there, not sure what to do.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Why would loving, helpful Rudy need an
industrial-grade lock...
He looks around and spots a LIPSTICK CAMERA above the door.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 51.

40 EXT. RUDY’S BUILDING - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 3 40
Dapper, dignified Dexter is waist-deep in a DUMPSTER,
rooting through garbage.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Oh, the humanity. Times like this, I
wish the truth was more easily
accessible. And less ripe.
He rips open a garbage bag, watches its contents spill at
his feet. Rifles through it.
DEXTER (V.O.)
But Harry taught me to trust my gut.
Rifling through its contents, Dexter clearly finds this
distasteful. Still, he picks up yet another bag, tears into
it. Its contents fall... and Dexter sees something.
DEXTER (V.O.)
People lie all the time, he said.
He bends down, picks up a colorful, mass-mailed ENVELOPE.
Splashed across the front in large type: “RUDY COOPER, YOU
MAY ALREADY BE A WINNER!!” He digs in to the new pile of
garbage, rooting around, searching for something. REVEAL
Dexter holds in his gloved hand a used COTTON BALL -- with a
small speck of BLOOD on it.
DEXTER
But your instinct will never fail
you.
41 EXT. MARINA - NIGHT 3 41
Debra approaches the dock.
DEBRA
Fuck me.
REVEAL Rudy standing in front of the yacht, now amply decked
out with colorful PATIO LIGHTS. He holds a single white
rose.
RUDY
I believe your rules specifically
prohibit such action.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 52.
39 CONTINUED: 39
DEBRA
You did all this?
RUDY
In fact, I did. You like?
He hands her the rose and kisses her. She turns to him.
DEBRA
I like. I like so much that what I
have to tell you is a lot harder.
RUDY
Please tell me you’re not leaving.
DEBRA
(torn)
I’m sorry, I hit traffic, I spent a
half-hour getting here. I have to
turn around and go back. Least I got
to see you.
Rudy, smiling, takes out a ring -- MONIQUE’S RING -- from
his pocket and gets down on bended knee.
DEBRA
Wait. Hang on --
RUDY
You’re sorta forcing my hand here. I
wanted to save this part till we were
on the water, but, here goes.
He takes Debra’s hand. Her grin is about to split her face.
RUDY
I know it seems fast. But to me, it
feels like I’ve waited my whole life
for you. And now that you’re here...
I don’t want you to leave.
(smiling up at her)
Debra Morgan... will you marry me?
DEBRA
I knew it! I fucking knew it!
RUDY
Um... is that your version of yes?
DEBRA
Yes. But...
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 53.
41 CONTINUED: 41
RUDY
No, no. Stop at yes, I liked that
part.
DEBRA
Yes, but... let’s slow it down. Lemme
savor this. I wanna be with you. And
I wanna enjoy it. So I say “yes,
but.”
RUDY
Okay. I get it.
DEBRA
You do?
RUDY
Not really. But I think I can work
with it.
DEBRA
Good. So, um...
(grinning)
I can still wear the ring, right?
The wheels turn in Rudy’s head. Something clicks...
RUDY
Yes... but.
He grins at her, as he slips the ring on her finger.
RUDY
There’s a condition.
DEBRA
Oh, is there?
RUDY
Yes. I know you have to go back. But
if you’re gonna wear the ring, we have
to celebrate. One glass of wine.
That’s all I ask.
DEBRA
Rudy...
RUDY
I mean it, don’t leave your sort-of
fiance here on a yacht with a cold
meal and unopened wine. That’s kinda
cruel, isn’t it?
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 54.
41 CONTINUED: (2) 41
Debra hesitates...
RUDY
One glass of wine. To celebrate.
Then you go back to saving Miami from
the Ice Truck Killer.
Debra looks up at him. Beaming.
DEBRA
I can live with that.
Sweeping her up and into his arms, Rudy romantically carries
Debra up to the yacht...
42 INT. POLICE STATION - LAB - NIGHT 3 42
Dexter, still dirty and disheveled, carries A BLOOD SLIDE
and the COTTON BALL to a YOUNG LAB TECH at her computer
wearing iPod headphones.
DEXTER
I need these checked against each
other.
(hands her the samples)
It’s kind of a rush.
The tech just keeps bopping to the music. Doesn’t hear him.
DEXTER
Excuse me. Hi.
Still nothing. So Dexter reaches over and removes her
headphones. Hands the surprised tech the slides.
DEXTER
These. Tested against each other.
Now.
He turns to go, and pulls out his cell phone. Presses Speed
Dial for Debra. It rings and rings, then:
DEBRA’S VOICE
It’s Deb. Do it.
DEXTER
(after the BEEP)
Hey, I know you’re working. Just let
me know when you come up for air, I
need to talk to you. I’m in the

Rudy at the couch pouring CHAMPAGNE into TWO GLASSES. Debra
enters from the adjoining room.
DEBRA
This yacht is amazing. Didn’t know
you went for stuff like this.
RUDY
There’s a lot to learn about me.
(then)
Did I hear your phone ring?
DEBRA
Yup. Big brother. I let it roll to
voice mail. Figured he could wait
till we were done here.
RUDY
(relieved)
Good. I want you all to myself. So
let the toasting begin, right?
He holds out a glass, and she comes to the couch, takes it
and sits. They clink glasses...
RUDY
To what comes next.
ON DEBRA as she sips. She hears a CRINKLING SOUND. She
turns to see Rudy, his champagne still untouched, pop a
THROAT LOZENGE. He moves to kiss her -- she stops him.
DEBRA
You’re not drinking. And you smell
like menthol, which it turns out is
not that sexy.
She sees the discarded lozenge wrapper -- the same wrapper
we saw in Episode 105 -- and bends down to pick it up.
RUDY
What’s wrong?
DEBRA
Nothing. Bad memories.
RUDY
(off the wrapper)
Oh, that’s right. The one clue the
Ice Truck Killer left behind, right?
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 56.
DEBRA
Right. Wait. How do you know?
Rudy leans behind her, starts massaging her shoulders,
exactly like he did Monique. Kisses her neck.
RUDY
I don’t make mistakes very often, but
when I do... they haunt me.
He slides his arms around her chest. Again, like Monique.
DEBRA
Hilarious.
(then)
Your champagne’s gonna get warm.
Rudy slips his arm to her neck and clasps it with the other.
RUDY
You know that thing I’ve been dying to
ask you? How could you not know who I
was? You’re a cop.
Debra grows uncomfortable. Tries moving. Can’t.
DEBRA
This isn’t funny.
But Rudy doesn’t release his grip, squeezing it tighter.
RUDY
I’d think a real cop would have at
least a sense she was in the presence
of the person she’s been hunting,
right?
DEBRA
Rudy. You’re hurting me.
RUDY
(whispers in her ear)
I never got to show you the best part
of my loft. I built it myself. The
refrigerated room.
ON DEBRA. A slow, cold realization washing over her.
DEBRA
No. No, that’s fucking impossible.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 57.
43 CONTINUED: 43
Debra pivots, SLAMMING her elbow into his chin. He lets go.
She tries to run but she’s not fast enough -- he grabs her
shoulder. She spins, throws a punch, but he grabs it, using
her momentum against her. He wraps his arm around her neck.
RUDY
You can fight, but everything’s in
motion now. Maybe a little faster
than I had planned.
He drags her back onto the couch. She struggles in vain.
DEBRA
(gasping)
Why’re you doing this?
RUDY
The tricky part was getting you on the
boat. The other women, I could just
pay them to go where I wanted.
He leans in, presses his head against hers to force it into
the same, unnatural angle we saw earlier. Debra keeps
fighting, but she’s growing weary.
RUDY
But... in the end, you made it easy.
So desperate to fall in love.
Tears stream down Debra’s face; she knows the end is near.
DEBRA
Stop...
Rudy’s chokehold cuts off her oxygen.
DEBRA
(barely a whisper)
... please.
OFF Debra’s eyes rolling back into her head...
44 INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT 3 44
Dexter, walking at HALF-SPEED, looks down the corridor, sees
Camillia at the stairwell door, leaving for the day.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Not much scares Camillia. But this
morning, I could see she was afraid.
Dexter watches the STAIRWELL DOOR swing closed and SLAM
SHUT. Camillia’s gone.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 58.
43 CONTINUED: (2) 43
DEXTER (V.O.)
Afraid of what I’ll eventually find.
Truth be told, so am I.
Realizing, he looks at his cell phone. No calls.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Hey. How busy could Deb be?
REGULAR SPEED RETURNS, as Masuka screeches up.
MASUKA
Dude, you gotta see this.
He holds out a file. Dexter doesn’t take it.
MASUKA
The autopsy on our Santa’s Cottage
victim. Check it out, one arm was
shorter than the other. So I started
thinking, our guy doesn’t get sloppy.
He’s precise.
DEXTER
Not now, Vince.
MASUKA
See, the left wrist was two inches
shorter than the right. Why cut off
more on the left than the right?
Masuka waggles the file at Dexter again, wanting him to
look.
MASUKA
Because she was a fucking amputee. I
looked up her medical records. She
had a fake left hand. That’s why we
never found it. The killer cut off
the extra piece of wrist so we
wouldn’t see her stump.
DEXTER
Give me that.
He finally takes the file from Masuka.
MASUKA
The night Batista was stabbed, he was
following up on a lead he got from a
one-handed call girl. Guess what the
lead was about?
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 59.
44 CONTINUED: 44
Dexter looks up from the file. Stunned.
DEXTER
The Ice Truck Killer.
MASUKA
Boo-yah.
DEXTER
Batista was attacked by the Ice Truck
Killer because he got too close...
Without another word, Dexter hands back the file, turns and
heads back to:
45 INT. POLICE STATION - LAB/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 3 45
Dexter stares at the Young Lab Tech. Everyone else in the
room might as well not exist.
DEXTER
You’re absolutely sure.
YOUNG LAB TECH
Positive. The samples you gave me
were a match -- they were from the
same person.
PUSH IN on Dexter. His world collapsing.
DEXTER (V.O.)
Rudy is the Ice Truck Killer.
The thought chills Dexter to the bone.
YOUNG LAB TECH
Hey. Are you all right?
But he’s already gone, rushing to the corridor. As Dexter
races out, REVEAL Doakes. Unseen by Dexter, he enters the
lab behind him.
DOAKES
What was he doing here?
(off the Tech’s
confusion)
Morgan. What was he doing in here?
YOUNG LAB TECH
It was blood samples. He needed me to
compare two blood samples.
DEXTER 111 "Truth Be Told" Final Draft -- 10/02/06 60.
44 CONTINUED: (2) 44
DOAKES
What blood samples?
The Lab Tech withers under Doakes’ stare.
YOUNG LAB TECH
(intimidated)
I don’t know. He, um, didn’t say. Am
I in some sort of trouble?
Doakes reaches out, grabs the LAB REPORT from the Young Lab
Tech. Scans it for a beat. Looks back.
DOAKES
What the fuck is he doing?
46 INT. POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT 3 46
Dexter, growing desperate, scans the bullpen: lots of cops.
No Debra. He turns to the nearest body -- Detective Simms.
DEXTER
Where’s my sister?
DETECTIVE SIMMS
Took her code twelve. Left about an
hour ago.
DEXTER
She went to dinner? She wasn’t
supposed to leave here.
He grabs a WALKIE off a desk and speaks into it:
DEXTER
Dispatch, it’s Dexter Morgan. I need
you to raise Officer Debra Morgan on
her radio.
COME AROUND Dexter, radio in hand, as he waits for a long,
agonizing beat.
DISPATCH (O.S.)
Sorry, sir, she’s not responding.
Would you like me to try again?
Dexter drops the radio on the desk and races from the
bullpen.
47 EXT. POLICE STATION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 3 47
Dexter bursts outside, his cell phone to his ear.
Panicking. Eyes searching. The other end RINGS until:

DEBRA’S VOICE
It’s Debra. Do it.
DEXTER
(after the BEEP)
Where the fuck are you? I’m here at
work, and you’re not. I need to talk
to you. Do not see Rudy until you
find me. Call me when you get this.
He hangs up. Look around. Shit! Desperate, he flips open
his phone again, hits redial. As the phone RINGS and
RINGS...
48 EXT. RUDY’S YACHT - DECK - NIGHT 3 48
ON RUDY, at the yacht’s helm, motoring off to parts unknown,
Debra’s RINGING cell phone in hand. He glances down at the
display: “DEXTER CALLING”.
Rudy grins, then forcefully HURLS her phone over the side of
the yacht into the dark, churning waters. REVEAL Debra
lying on the deck, OUT COLD, duct tape binding her legs
together and her hands to the rail (but no tape on her
mouth). OFF her still, unconscious form, we --
SMASH TO BLACK.

"Blood & Chrome"
A Movie in Ten Parts
Story by Michael Taylor, David Eick,
& Bradley Thompson & David Weddle
Teleplay by
Michael Taylor
Pre-Production Draft, 11/30/10
“Blood & Chrome”
ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1 EXT. SPACE - STARFIELD 1
A beat, then a familiar dire rhythm of TAIKO DRUMS fades up as
12 stars flash brightly and race toward us to wheel in a *
circle, establishing the border of a 3-D LOGO for the Colonial *
Defense Forces, as the drumming segues to a patriotic theme, *
There’s a dated, “newsreel” vibe to this, and the film stock *
itself seems degraded, as if it’s years old and much played. *
The logo retreats to a corner, where it lingers like the SyFy
bug as the image of space is replaced by...
2 EXT. CAPRICA CITY - DAY 2
The pyramid stadium and the splendid city.
OFFICIAL VOICE
Caprica City. Then...
The city become a partial ruins, strafed and bomb-pocked.
OFFICIAL VOICE (cont’d)
...and now.
3 EXT. GEMENON - DAY 3
The stunning religious capital: Dubai meets ancient Rome.
OFFICIAL VOICE
Gemenon, the holy city of Oranu, then...
The glittering cityscape yields to a similar image of
devastation (not post-nuclear; more London during the Blitz).
OFFICIAL VOICE (cont’d)
...and now.
4 EXT. AQUARION - DAY 4
The Reykjavik-like capital of Heim, powered by sun and wind,
glaciers at its back, its harbor embracing an icy sea.
OFFICIAL VOICE
Aquarion then...
Now the city is partly destroyed and the icy harbor is filled
by the spectacular wreckage of a massive Cylon Base Star.
(CONTINUED)
OFFICIAL VOICE (cont’d)
...and now.
5 MEDIA IMAGES 5
from the Colonial wars, some culled from Tauron civil war
footage used in Caprica, others from contemporary war footage.
OFFICIAL VOICE
Caprica. Gemenon. Tauron. Once we had
as many causes to hate each other as we
had names for our worlds. Now we have
but one name, “human,” and one cause:
to defeat a ruthless machine enemy bent
on our destruction. And after years of
painful struggle, victory is within
reach, thanks to the latest addition to *
the Colonial Fleet...
6 EXT. SPACE - A MARK II VIPER 6
swoops past us as we REVEAL the brand-spanking new BATTLESTAR *
GALACTICA, her artillery pounding a Cylon Base Star while her *
Vipers tear through a swarm of Raiders.
OFFICIAL VOICE
...the Battlestar Galactica, which along *
with its sister ships, Columbia and
Prometheus, is showing the Cylon no quarter.
7 INT. GALACTICA - CIC 7
The command center a busy hive in the midst of battle,
COMMANDER SILAS NASH, 40s, presiding coolly at its center.
OFFICIAL VOICE
The strength of Galactica’s armor --
which can withstand a nuclear blast --
is matched by the impregnability of its
internal systems, which rely on
hardened, independent computers, which
leave the Cylons no networks to
penetrate, but above all...
A LIEUTENANT works out firing solutions at her station, then
relays them to the XO, who calls them into a corded handset.
OFFICIAL VOICE (cont’d)
...on good old-fashioned human ingenuity and
teamwork. Yes, our powerful weapons and *
warships give them the tools they need... *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 2.
4 CONTINUED: 4
8 INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY 8
Bigger and busier -- thanks to our full CGI treatment -- than
we’ve ever seen it. A chiseled, fresh-faced young Viper jock,
DEKE TORNVALD, trots confidently to his plane along with a
bunch of other pilots who fan out to Vipers and Raptors.
OFFICIAL VOICE
...but our true strength lies in the *
skill and courage of our fighters, men
and women like Galactics’s Deke Tornvald
and his fellow Viper “jocks,” the cream
of the Colonial militia.
Tornvald’s canopy shuts, he gives the CREW CHIEF a thumbs up
and the plane is towed forward into a launch tube.
9 INT. GALACTICA - LAUNCH TUBE 9
Various angles: the inner airlock DOOR closes, the CATAPULT
engages and we experience that classic...
10 VIPER PILOT POV 10
as we rocket out the tube and into space, joining the fight.
OFFICIAL VOICE
Thanks to their fearless dedication, and
that of countless soldiers like them,
this war will be won, and won soon!
The bombastic music fades away, replaced by the lonely sound
of wind whistling through the tree tops, as we DISSOLVE TO: *
11 EXT. SPACE - AN ICE-ENCRUSTED MOON 11 *
Hangs beside a ringed planet. Pushing in as we DISSOLVE TO... *
12 EXT. MOON’S ATMOSPHERE - DAY 12
We’re gliding over dense cloud cover, an Everest-like peak *
jutting through, a mist of snow whipping off it. Just that *
lonely sound of the wind for another beat, then: *
MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
Frak me. Is this thing on? Can never
tell if it’s... okay, red light’s
flashing, good. Hey, Dad. Sorry this
message is gonna miss your birthday, but
I’ve been busy, as you might’a guessed.
Gliding lower now, penetrating the cloud cover to reveal a *
snowy landscape of craggy mountains and glaciers. We start to *
descend rapidly now, approaching an icy ledge far below. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 3.
(CONTINUED)
MAN’S VOICE(V.O.)
They say a man can find himself in war.
The good parts and the bad. Two weeks
in and I’ve already found some of those
things. Can’t say I’m entirely proud.
Finally we detect a figure kneeling on the ledge. It's a *
young soldier: barely out of his teens but looking, at this *
moment, many years older. We don’t reveal his face fully yet,
instead glimpsing him in pieces: haunted eyes; bloodied hands *
lying in his lap, as if abandoned there; torn and stained *
Colonial uniform under a tattered parka. His head is lowered. *
MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
Wish I could talk about it with you but
it’s all classified.
(beat)
Anyway, it all worked out. Got what I
wanted. So, yeah, I guess it’s like you
always said...
There's a ROAR OF ENGINES overhead. The young man slowly *
lifts his head. And as we now we reveal his partly obscured
NAME TAG, “ADAMA,” then push in on that grunt’s thousand-yard
stare...
ADAMA (V.O.)
We all get what’s coming to us.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
13 EXT. SPACE - VIPER 13
The SAME YOUNG MAN, Ensign WILLIAM ADAMA, in the cockpit of a
VIPER as he chases down a Cylon RAIDER, finessing the stick to *
get the elusive quarry in his sights as he mutters to himself: *
ADAMA *
Hold still, you Toaster bastards. *
SUPER: Seven days earlier.
WIRELESS VOICE *
Watch out, hotshot, got two more bandits
on your six.
Indeed, two more Raiders have rolled in behind Adama. Tracer
fire streaks by as he glances over his shoulder.
ADAMA
Fine, just adds to the challenge. *
WIRELESS VOICE
C’mon, kid, break off! Break off!
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 4.
12 CONTINUED: 12
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA
No! I got this!
And while jinking his plane to elude fire, he still manages to
get a lock on the Raider he’s pursuing. He thumbs his guns
and blows it away. Then he jerks the stick to flip his Viper
ass over nose, and flying backwards he fires again, taking out
both his pursuers.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Yeah! Deal with it, cocksuckers!
FEMALE VOICE
Congratulations, Ensign, you have
completed Level Six. Final scores are
now being compiled.
And now the entire scene, including the Viper he’s sitting in,
is DECONSTRUCTED into a WIRE FRAME IMAGE, and Adama watches 3-
D scores being compiled in the virtual space around him, as if
on a giant scoreboard: “Kills: 27. Losses: 1. Accuracy:
87 Percent. Time to Complete: 12:26:10.”
ADAMA
Tell me that ain’t a record.
FEMALE VOICE
It is indeed a class record.
ADAMA
Kiss. My. Ass!
He reaches toward his temples, as we establish: *
14 EXT. SPACE - MILITARY TRANSPORT 14
Like a space-going version of a C-17.
15 INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT 15 *
Ensign WILLIAM ADAMA, in a pristine uniform, beams as he
removes his HOLOBAND. He’s seated on a bench amidst other *
soldiers and CARGO. Conduits and wiring are exposed for
access and to save weight.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Good SIM score?
Adama turns to find an attractive young Lieutenant, JAYCIE
MCGAVIN. She’s a Raptor pilot just a year or two older than
he is, but that time has been spent in combat and it’s given
her a maturity he’s too green to even appreciate.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 5.
13 CONTINUED: 13
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA
Top score.
JAYCIE
I’m impressed.
ADAMA
I’d be, if I were you.
Jaycie just smiles, sizing him up.
JAYCIE
Lemme guess: you’re fresh out of the
Academy, been itching to fly Vipers
since you were in short pants, and your
only worry now is that the war will be
over before you get a chance to prove
what a bona fide ace you are.
ADAMA
You got me pegged, ‘cept for the
worrying part. I don’t do that.
JAYCIE
Well, look at the pair on you.
ADAMA
That a request?
JAYCIE
Don’t get your hopes up, rook. You’re
not my type.
ADAMA
Why? You like older guys? Girls?
JAYCIE
I like someone with a better shot at
being alive on a Saturday night.
ADAMA
(undeterred)
So it’s a date.
Jaycie just shakes her head, amused, but their flirtation is
interrupted by the whooping of a bunch of MARINES crowded
around a a ruggedized iPad-like DEVICE reverberating with the
sounds of gunfire and TAURON HEAVY METAL. Jaycie’s pissed.
JAYCIE
Frakkin’ Jarheads with their war porn.
ADAMA
Their what?
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 6.
15 CONTINUED: 15
(CONTINUED)
JAYCIE
You been in flight school or a cave?
“War porn,” you know? Gun camera footage
of firefights, Toasters getting lit up,
shit like that. The grunts like to trade
it, like kids with Pyramid cards.
ADAMA
No frakking way.
He’s intrigued, cranes his neck for a look.
POV ON THE VIEWER
A NIGHT-VISION SNIPER'S POV of a downed Cylon Centurion, lying
wounded in a rubble-strewn city square.
MARINE (O.S.)
Here he comes again!
More raucous laughter and shouts as a second Centurion
cautiously comes to its fallen comrade's rescue. But as it
begins to drag the wounded Cylon away, a heavy TRACER ROUND
spirals in and tears off its arm. Then more rounds tear into
both Cylons as the Marines hoot and holler appreciatively: *
“Hell yeah!” “Frak that Toaster up!” “Bitchin’!” etc.
Adama experiences a giddy, almost sickly sense of revelation:
he’s seeing actual combat. For Jaycie, it’s just sick.
JAYCIE
So what’s next? You guys gonna whip out
your dicks and have a circle jerk?
MARINE
Got a problem, fly-girl?
JAYCIE
Just with loud asshole Marines and their
frakked up “home movies.”
MARINE
Whoa! Think we got ourselves a symp,
guys. Bet “Cylon Suzie” here thinks we
should negotiate with the poor,
misunderstood machines.
JAYCIE
Screw you, shitbird. I’ve wasted more
Toasters than you’ve got pimples on your
lily-white ass. Just don’t need to
watch myself doing it.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 7.
15 CONTINUED: (2) 15
(CONTINUED)
They all just turn back to their “home movie,” laughing and
leaving Jaycie steaming. Adama tries to re-engage her.
ADAMA
So, not having seen his ass, how many
Toasters would that be?
JAYCIE
(curt)
I don’t keep count.
ADAMA
I will.
Jaycie fixes him with a cool look.
JAYCIE
You’re a real charger, aren’t you rook?
Well if you’re lookin’ for action,
there’s the girl who’s gonna give it to
you.
She nods to a window and Adama turns to see GALACTICA looming
up. No longer the pristine Battlestar from the old newsreel;
its hull is scarred in places. But it’s no less imposing, *
with its Viper CAP buzzing around it and support ships riding *
its flanks like pilot fish alongside a Great White. *
ADAMA
Gods... damn.
16 INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY 16
Adama, his DUFFEL slung over his shoulder, steps off the
loading ramp of the Transport, then goggles at the size and
activity of the Hangar Deck. Flight crew in their orange *
jumpers swarming over Vipers. Raptors descending on *
elevators. Jaycie catches up with him.
JAYCIE
You’re blocking traffic, rook.
Adama sees a network NEWS TEAM interviewing a Viper pilot by
his plane. It’s Deke Tornvald, no longer the fresh-faced
young man from the recruiting video, instead a seasoned ace
with the SYMBOLS of more than 30 Raider kills painted on his
plane, and a certain grim cast to his features that he can’t
quite hide as he talks to the news team.
ADAMA
That’s Deke Tornvald. “Minute Man.”
JAYCIE
Heard of him, huh?
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 8.
15 CONTINUED: (3) 15
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA
Guy was my hero at the Academy. What’s
he got now -- like 30 kills?
JAYCIE
Better hurry or there won’t be any left
for you, ace.
A CAG, Captain ARMIN “HIGH TOP” RIOS, 30s, approaches.
RIOS
McGavin, back just in time. Suit up.
Briefing in thirty.
JAYCIE
Another snowball patrol?
RIOS
You got it.
He eyes Adama, who snaps an Academy-issue salute, then holds
out his ORDERS. Jaycie just smiles wryly and heads off.
ADAMA
Ensign William Adama, reporting for
flight duty, sir. If there’s a mission,
I’d like to be part of it.
Meanwhile, a female LIEUTENANT comes over with a clipboard
with a flight deck status report for Rios to review.
RIOS
You’re F.O.B., Ensign. Sure you don’t
want to find your rack first?
ADAMA
Respectfully, sir, I signed on to kill
Toasters, not take naps. Just point me
at my plane and I’ll get started.
Rios and the Lieutenant share a look, she indicates something
on the report. He nods then sizes up Adama again.
RIOS
Okay, Ensign, I’m assigning you to the
Weasel. She’s over there.
He points somewhat vaguely across the deck. Adama eagerly
eyes a GLEAMING VIPER being gassed up.
ADAMA
She’s a beauty, sir.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 9.
16 CONTINUED: 16
(CONTINUED)
RIOS
No, rook, not the Viper. The bird
behind it.
And now Adama realizes he’s pointing to an old beat-to-shit
RAPTOR. Disbelief mixes with alarm.
ADAMA
The Raptor, sir?
RIOS
(off Adama’s paperwork)
I see you’re qualified.
ADAMA
Yes, sir. But, sir, ah --
RIOS
-- “Respectfully.”
ADAMA
Respectfully, sir, I didn’t rate top of
my class so I could drive a bus. I’m a
Viper pilot.
RIOS
All right, rook, I’ll break it down for
you. The brass makes it sound like
Operation Clean Sweep really lived up to
its name, only someone forgot to send
the Toasters the memo. They’ve peppered
all the rocks in this sector with
automated SAMS, which have been taking
down our planes right and left. Taking
out those missiles is job one. Which is
why I need Raptor drivers right now more
than Viper jocks. Which is why I want
you to march your cherry cheeks over
there and make sure your “bus” is ready
for action. Dismissed.
He heads off. Off Adama, chastened and disappointed...
17 ANGLE ON - THE BEAT-UP RAPTOR 17
“Wild Weasel” painted across the battered fuselage. REVEAL
ADAMA, regarding it with resignation. He steps up on the
wing, grabbing onto a support, and his hand comes away black
with grime. He looks around for a rag, sees none, and finally
anoints his new uniform. Then he ducks inside --
-- and runs smack into another ENSIGN exiting with a MOP and
BUCKET. The dirty, red water sloshes onto the deck.

ECO (Electronic Countermeasures Officer) COKER FASJOVIK, 27,
isn’t pleased.
COKER
Frak! You dumb bastard, I just finished
mucking this thing out!
ADAMA
Sorry, I didn’t see --
COKER
-- ‘course you didn’t, ‘cause you
weren’t looking! What the hell are you
doing in here anyway? You with that
godsdamn PR tour?
He’s already started mopping up the mess.
ADAMA
No, I’m, uh...

William Adama. I was just assigned to
fly this --
Coker ignores the hand, cuts him off again in disbelief --
COKER
You? You’re my new driver? They sent
me some ‘rook fresh off the boat?
ADAMA
(realizing)
Guess you must be my ECO.
COKER
Not if I can do anything about it.
Adama sees some rags on the floor, crouches to help clean up.
ADAMA
Here, let me, uh...
COKER
Whatever.
Adama glances up at Coker’s name tag, tries to pronounce it.
ADAMA
Fazjo... Fahzo...?
COKER
Frak. You gotta call me something, just
call me Coker. Only don’t get too
familiar with it.

ADAMA
So, Coker, who was your last pilot?
COKER
You’re helping mop up what’s left of
him.
And suddenly Adama realizes he’s got a CHUNK of BRAIN MATTER
in his rag. He fights back his nausea. Coker is too wound up
to even notice, muttering as he finishes mopping.
COKER (cont’d)
Frakking knuckle draggers patch the
hole, don’t even bother mopping up the
rest of his brains. Not that he had
many to begin with, poor bastard. Who
the frak signs up for a third tour?
ADAMA
Look, I’m sorry about your friend.
COKER
He wasn’t my frakking friend! He was an
asshole. And he was worth ten huskers
like you!
“Husker?” Adama’s still trying to puzzle out that apparent
insult when a BUZZER sounds. Coker sighs, takes out a hip
FLASK and takes a nip.
COKER (cont’d)
Briefing call. Here we go again.
(eyes Adama, resigned)
Just listen good and try real hard not
to get us killed, ‘kay, rook?
He stomps down the wing. OFF Adama...

COKER
Forget what any of those other cocky
douches might’a told you, these new
Toaster SAMS are smart.
ADAMA
Right.
COKER
Basically, it’s a game of chicken: you
wait till its Dradis paints you, then
send your missile down its beam before
it can fire up one of its own.
ADAMA
(bored)
I heard the briefing.
COKER
What, this too low-rent for you, Husker?
ADAMA
I trained to take on Raiders in three-onone
scenarios. I’m not too worried
about shooting up some missile
launchers, no matter how smart they are.
COKER

Adama adjusts course to bring them closer to the asteroid.
ADAMA
Got it. Adjusting course.
COKER
Yeah, looks like we got one... no could
be two batteries.
20 EXT. ASTEROID - TWO CYLON SAMS 20
Partly hidden in the crevices of the icy rock. Each SAM has
some equivalent of the Cylon oscillating red eye. Suddenly,
one of them swivels and points its batteries up.
21 INT. WILD WEASEL 21
An ALARM sounds on Coker’s board.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 13.
19 CONTINUED: 19

COKER
First one’s painted us. Locked on their
beam. Fire one down the pipe.
But Adama makes no move to fire. Instead, he just maneuvers
the Raptor closer to the asteroid.
COKER (cont’d)
What the frak? I said fire the rocket!
ADAMA
You spotted two batteries.
COKER
So what? First one’s locked on us.
What are you frakking waiting for?
ADAMA
For the other one to paint us.
COKER
This ain’t a two-for-one sale!
(another ALARM)
Now they’re both locked on!
ADAMA
Firing.
22 EXT. SPACE - WILD WEASEL 22
Two missiles are launched, as we INTERCUT the action with:
23 EXT. ASTEROID 23
The Raptor’s missiles slam into the batteries, destroying
both, but not before each gets off one of their own missiles.
24 INT. WILD WEASEL 24
Adama just sees the explosive blooms below and exults.
ADAMA
Got ‘em!
COKER
No, asshole, you got us! Two SAMS
incoming.
ADAMA
Shit. Hang on!
The Raptor banks and starts to roar away. But the two CYLON
MISSILES are tearing after it and rapidly gaining.
END OF ACT ONE

21 CONTINUED: 21
ACT TWO
25 EXT. SPACE 25 *
The Raptor weaves through asteroids, but the missiles continue
to gain. INTERCUTTING with:
26 INT. WILD WEASEL 26
Adama guns the ship through the asteroids,
COKER
Four klicks and closing!
ADAMA
I need more speed.
COKER
You can’t outrun ‘em! Three klicks and
closing.
ADAMA
Countermeasures?
COKER
I know my job!
Coker hits a control and the Raptor ejects a cloud of CHAFF.
The missiles briefly diverge and disappear in the cloud, only
to re-emerge and lock onto the Raptor again.
COKER (cont’d)
They didn’t go for it! Told you they
were smart.
ADAMA
Let’s see how smart.
He steers the Raptor away from the asteroids.
COKER
Now you’re heading into open space?
We’ll have no cover!
ADAMA
We’re not gonna need it. Hang onto
something.
He suddenly flips the Raptor nose over tail, just as he did in
the training sim. Only the heavy Raptor doesn’t respond like
a nimble Viper. Loose stuff goes flying, including Coker. *
COKER
Frak!
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 15.
(CONTINUED)
Now Adama kicks in the afterburners and flies directly at the
missiles, in what looks like an even more literal game of
chicken, as Coker reacts in disbelief.
COKER (cont’d)
What the hell are you doing?!
ADAMA
Seeing if I can scramble their brains.
A split second away from impact, Adama amazingly slips the *
Raptor right between both missiles, which now try to turn 180
degrees to follow, only to go spiraling off harmlessly. He *
turns with a grin to Coker, who’s picking himself off the *
deck.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Toaster missiles may be smart but their
guidance systems still can’t withstand a
50-G turn.
(beat)
Wanna get some more?
Off Coker’s glare...
27 INT. GALACTICA - PORT LANDING BAY 27 *
Looking through the window into the Landing Control Room (like *
a compact airport control tower, and adapted from our digital *
build of the upper level of CIC). Coker can be seen *
complaining angrily to a forbearing Rios while, at the other *
end, Adama mimes his maneuver to the Landing Signals Officer. *
28 INT. GALACTICA - PORT LANDING CONTROL - COKER AND RIOS 28 *
RIOS *
I don’t have another back-seater I can *
spare. Besides, he did take out two *
batteries. *
COKER
And now look at him: he’s frakking *
bragging about how he broke SOP and *
almost got us killed. *
RIOS
You’re short, aren’t you? What’ve you
got? Another couple of months?
COKER
That’s not what this is about.
Rios just eyes him for a beat, then calls sharply to Adama.

RIOS
Ensign! Front and center.
ADAMA
Yes, sir.
RIOS
Looks like you two have a problem.
ADAMA
Not me, sir.
RIOS
Well if your ECO has a problem with you,
then you both have one. I want results, *
but what I don’t want is dead pilots and
wrecked planes.
(to Adama)
And if you think you can hot-dog your
way into a Viper, guess again, rook.
Far as I’m concerned, you two are
married, so get used to it. *
ADAMA
Yes, sir. Anything else, sir?
RIOS
Yeah, go see the Old Man in CIC. He’s
got a special mission for you.
29 INT. GALACTICA - JUMP DRIVE CATWALK 29
Adama and Coker walk along a catwalk that leads through
Galactica’s massive Jump Drive.
ADAMA
I thought partners were supposed to back
each other up.
COKER
You don’t listen to me, we’re not
partners. We’re just two guys sharing
the same plane.
ADAMA
Yeah, well maybe the Old Man was a a
little more impressed. Why else would he *
be assigning us to this special mission?
Gotta be something big, right?
COKER
Keep dreaming, Husker.
Adama stops, confronts him.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 17.
28 CONTINUED: 28
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA
What’s your problem? You’ve been on me
since I met you. And what’s with this
“husker” thing?
Coker takes out his flask again, unscrews the top.
COKER
Well, to answer your first question, my
“problem” is that I still have hopes of
surviving this war, and you seem to be a
serious obstacle to my achieving that
goal. As to your second question, *
“Husker” is what we called the hayseed *
losers back on Aerilon, the farmboys who
couldn’t steer their tractors straight.
ADAMA
I’m from Caprica City. The closest I
ever got to a farm was my uncle’s ranch
north of Delphi.
Coker takes a slug, then offers a mocking toast.
COKER
Whatever you say, Husker.
He heads off. Off Adama, really pissed now...
30 INT. GALACTICA - CIC 30
Adama and Coker stand at attention at the Command and Control
station, their PERSONNEL FILES lying prominently on the
backlit table in front of them, while Commander Silas Nash,
looking somewhat aged like the rest of his ship, confers with
his XO across the room, occasionally glancing over at them.
Adama sneaks a look at Coker, who’s staring rigidly ahead, an
notices Coker’s hip flask protruding a bit too prominently
from his back pocket. Quietly, eyes front again:
ADAMA
You gonna offer the Commander a drink?
COKER
What?
ADAMA
Flask.
Adama nods discreetly to the flask, and Coker -- unsure *
whether to be angry or grateful -- nudges it deeper into his *
pocket just before Nash comes over. He eyes Adama, then lifts
the cover of Coker’s personnel report.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 18.
29 CONTINUED: 29

NASH
Mister Fasjovik. Forty-seven days left
in your mandatory second tour. Planning
on re-upping?
COKER
Not if I get a say in it, sir.
NASH
Hard to part with an experienced ECO,
but it’s your call.
He opens Adama’s folder.
NASH (cont’d)
Ensign William Adama. Caprican... with
some interesting Tauron family
connections.
He eyes Adama, who stands a little more stiffly at attention.
NASH (cont’d)
Your grades at the Academy weren’t
exactly stellar but your flight
instructor says you’re a “natural.” I
quote: “One of the best pilot
candidates I’ve ever seen.” Is that
assessment accurate, Ensign? Are you a
natural?
ADAMA
I can fly a plane, sir. A “natural,” I
can’t say.
NASH
So you didn’t “naturally” know that the
guidance systems of the Cylons’ thirdgen
SAMS can’t handle turns of more than
46 Gs?
ADAMA
No, sir. But I figured forcing the
maneuver was our best bet.
NASH
So in other words, you were playing a
hunch. And this was after you let two
SAMS paint you so you could take out
both launchers. Why just two? Why not
go for a hat trick?
ADAMA
I would’ve, sir, if there were three
SAMS down there.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 19.
30 CONTINUED: 30
(CONTINUED)
Nash cracks a thin smile.
NASH
You’re a cocky sonofabitch, aren’t you,
Ensign? I used to like cocky sons of
bitches. I used to be a cocky
sonofabitch. But we’re ten years into a
bad war, son, so now this is how I treat
cocky sons of bitches on my ship.
He pushes some ORDERS across the table.
NASH (cont’d)
I assign ‘em to milk runs ‘til they cool
down.
(beat)
You’re going to take some cargo to the
Scorpion shipyards and return with spare
parts. It’s a four-day round trip. I’d
assign a jump-capable ship if I could
spare one, but I can’t, so your sorryass
Raptor will have to do.
(looks Adama in the eyes)
Above all, you’re to avoid any enemy
contact. That includes Cylon ships,
SAMS, slingshots, exploding dog poops or
anything else they might have floating
around out there. Understood?
ADAMA & COKER
Yes, sir.
NASH
Good.
He picks up his coffee mug, starts studying some other
reports. Without looking up:
NASH (cont’d)
You’re dismissed.
Coker and Adama exchange a brief look, then turn and head for
the hatch. Off Nash as he looks up to watch them go, his eyes
thoughtful over the rim of his mug.
31 INT. GALACTICA - OFFICERS’ HEAD 31
Adama and Coker enter with their shaving kits, towels around
their waists. Adama’s expression is sour, but Coker beams
like he just won the lottery.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 20.
30 CONTINUED: (2) 30
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA
“Milk run.” I said I didn’t want to
drive a bus, now they got me driving a
frakking delivery truck.
COKER
Yeah, only thing better is if they could
make it a regular trip, say for the next
month or so.
ADAMA
You’re really getting out?
COKER
Like a shot, kid.
ADAMA
And go back to what? Where?
A shadow creases Coker’s face, and we get a sense that there
are things he doesn’t want to discuss with his new partner.
Without answering, he heads off to the showers.
Adama looks after him, puzzled, then sees Tornvald shaving at
one of the metal sinks. Tornvald’s towel doesn’t entirely
hide a nasty BURN SCAR snaking up his thigh. His arms and
shoulders are covered with faded TATTOOS, and he hardly looks
like the poster boy that old newsreel made him out to be.
He’s shaving with a straight razor, very carefully, probably
so he won’t cut this throat because he’s also far from sober.
There’s a half-empty bottle of ambrosia next to his kit.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Captain? Captain Tornvald?
Tornvald looks at him briefly, then resumes shaving. Adama
seems’s about to extend his hand, then thinks better of it.
Maybe it’s the look in Tornvald’s eyes: that thousand-yard
stare now reflected in the mirror above the sink.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Sir, I just wanted to say I’ve been
following your record since you first
joined the Squadron, and I’m just hoping
to be half the pilot you are.
TORNVALD
You want to be half a flyer? Toasters
can probably arrange that.
ADAMA
That’s not what I, um... Sir, I just --

TORNVALD
I’ll let you in on a little secret, kid. *
It’s bullshit. All of it. *
And that’s the end of that conversation. Off Adama...
32 INT. GALACTICA - OFFICERS’ HEAD - SHOWERS 32
Finding Adama looking a little troubled as he stands under the
jets in a line of showers separated by shallow partitions.
Jaycie and Coker are showering to one side of him, Coker still
basking in his good fortune.
COKER
Two days out, two days back.
JAYCIE
You gonna lay over?
COKER
You better frakkin’ believe it. They
got real booze over there. None of this
watered-down pruno.
JAYCIE
Sounds like a bonafide pleasure cruise.
COKER
Tell it to young, dumb and fulla cum
over there. He’s still crying his eyes
out.
As meanwhile we start to INTERCUT shots of someone entering
the shower on the other side of Adama: a TOWEL is draped over
the end of the intervening partition, then an UNUSUAL “DOG
TAG,” looking more like a computer chip than a stamped hexagon
of metal. A WOMAN’S HAND picks up a bar of soap, rubs it over
toned shoulders. Water sluices through long, dark hair.
JAYCIE
Well, what do you expect? Our young
thane wants to make a name for himself.
Mount some Toaster heads in his mead
hall.
ADAMA
(bristling)
That’s what we’re here for, isn’t it?
Kill the enemy? Destroy the frakking
machines before they destroy us.
COKER
Hoo-ah!

31 CONTINUED: (2) 31
(CONTINUED)
He grabs his towel and heads out, as we now REVEAL the WOMAN
in the other stall reacting subtly to this exchange, smiling a
little bitterly to herself. She’s in her 30s, beautiful, with
an athlete’s toned body. Even naked there’s something about
her posture or attitude that makes her stand out -- or apart --
from the rest of the grunts showering here.
JAYCIE
(grabbing her towel)
We all know why we’re here, rook.
(then, gentler)
Don’t be in such a rush, okay?
Adama glances at her, but it’s clear he doesn’t appreciate her
genuine gesture for what it is. She exits.
He turns off the water, reaches around to grab his towel, only
to find he’s reaching for the same one as the woman in the
other stall. He finds himself staring at her chest, or rather
the unusual dog tag now hanging around her neck. A shower
faux pas either way, but the woman just seems amused.
WOMAN
You gonna keep staring or are you gonna
hand me my towel?
Embarrassed, Adama snaps out it and hands her the towel.
ADAMA
Sorry. I didn’t mean to, uh...
But the woman just takes it from him with a knowing smile and
walks off, not even bothering to wrap it around herself.
Despite his embarrassment, Adama finds himself staring again.
A couple of other female soldiers go by, laughing at him.
FEMALE SOLDIER
See anything you like, rook?
33 INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY 33
Adama and Coker are doing a pre-flight check of the Weasel,
Coker inspecting, Adama checking off items on a CLIPBOARD.
ADAMA
PC-1 Reservoir?
COKER
Full. Cap secure.
ADAMA
Left pylon support?

Coker grabs the pylon and gives it a good tug. It stays put.
COKER
Secure.
But then both look up as the Crew CHIEF steers over a FORKLIFT
with a pallet of COMMUNICATIONS DRONES, MISSILE DECOYS, and a
pair of slightly larger SHIP-TO-SHIP MISSILES.
COKER (cont’d)
Whoa, what the hell is this?
CHIEF
(hopping out and signaling
some DECKHANDS)
Your ordnance package, what’s it look
like?
COKER
It looks light. I see a full set of com
drones and missile decoys, but just two
Archers?
CHIEF
We’re short on air-to-airs. Ordnance
Chief says two, so two’s what you get.
You got a problem, take it up with him.
COKER
Maybe I will.
Adama is reviewing his checklist.
ADAMA
I’m more concerned with our cargo,
whatever it’s gonna be. Can you at
least give us the exact weight?
CHIEF
Why don’t you ask “it” yourself.
Coker and Adama follow his look to see the woman from the
showers, now zipped into a form-fitting flight suit,
approaching with a duffel slung over her shoulder.
COKER
She’s our cargo?
WOMAN
That’s right, and what’s more, “she” has
a name. Kelly. Dr. Beka Kelly.
COKER
Doctor?

BEKA
Ph.D. I’m a civilian software engineer.
ADAMA
Welcome aboard, Dr. I’m Bill Adama,
your pilot...
He holds out her hand but she ignores it, giving the Raptor a
critical once-over. Adama withdraws his hand, tries to cover
his embarrassment...
ADAMA (cont’d)
...and this is my co-pilot and ECO,
Coker Fasjo--
COKER
Coker’ll do.
Beka turns and gives Adama the same critical once-over she
gave the Raptor.
BEKA
You look kinda young for a pilot, even
in this war. You any good?
ADAMA
So they tell me.
BEKA
You always believe what people tell you?
She doesn’t give Adama time to figure out a comeback.
Beka (cont’d)
Well, if we’re through with the
pleasantries, and Ensign Adama is
through trying to guess my weight, why
don’t we get going...?
(eyeing the Raptor)
...assuming this piece of shit can
actually fly.
COKER
(reddening)
Piece of shit...?
Adama quickly intervenes.
ADAMA
I know she looks a little rough around
the edges but she’s fully operational.

the pod and into space.
ADAMA (WIRELESS)

LSO (WIRELESS)
Roger that, Niner-zero-niner. See you
in five. And maybe bring us back a

Anything to keep you from mooching off

A blast of the Raptor’s afterburners and Galactica and its
support ships start to dwindle behind it.
35 INT. WILD WEASEL 35
Beka is stowing her stuff in an aft compartment which can be
curtained or partitioned off. Adama and Coker are in the
front, no one wearing helmets for this non-combat flight.
ADAMA
Hello, this is the Captain. Our flight
time to Scorpian is approximately two
days, during which we hope to
encounter... nothing. Fortunately, you
will find a variety of fine Holoband
entertainments to help you pass the
time. I personally recommend,
“Emergency Disassembly of the F61 Vulcan
Missile Deployment Subsystem.” For now,
please remain seated with your seatbelt
securely fastened and thank you for
flying Wild Weasel airlines.
In the back, Beka smiles to herself, then takes out an
official-looking ENVELOPE from her duffle. Coker eyes Adama.
COKER
You’re wasting your charms, such as they
are. I know her type.

BEKA
Are we still in Dradis range of
Galactica?
COKER

Not anymore.
BEKA
Good. If you’ll open this, you’ll find
new orders.
She hands him an envelope marked “Top Secret” and bearing the
Colonial Defense Forces Seal.
COKER
What the hell is this?
BEKA
Open it and you’ll find out.
Coker and Adama share a look, then Coker opens the envelope
and reviews the order, his brow furrowing with concern.
COKER
These are from the Admiralty.
BEKA
As you can see, it specifies a new set
of coordinates for a rendezvous with the
heavy cruiser Archeron.
COKER
That’s two days in the wrong direction,
lady.
ADAMA
(glancing over)
Sector 12. Right on the edge of Cyloncontrolled
space.
COKER
No. No frakking way this is right. I’m
calling Galactica.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 27.
35 CONTINUED: 35

BEKA
The orders specify wireless silence
until we meet up with Archeron. That
means no contact with Galactica or any
other Colonial ship or outpost. And
since, as you already noted, we have a
lot of space to cover, I suggest we get
started.
She heads aft. Coker is stunned by this turn of events. Then
he notices Adama smiling as he inputs new coordinates.
COKER
What the hell are you grinning at?
ADAMA
“Milk run.”
COKER
Milk run, my ass. The Old Man set us
up. Knew I was short and sent us
anyway. All ‘cause you had to go and
impress him.
ADAMA
And maybe because whatever she’s doing,
it’s important, and he trusts us to get
her where she needs to go.
COKER
Well, I’m so glad you finally feel
validated...
He glances at Beka, who’s made herself comfy with a book.
COKER (cont’d)

First kind aren’t necessarily better

anyway -- of their MCP chips. That’s
their --
ADAMA
-- Their brain, I know. In other words,
you helped improve the machines that are
killing us. Made them smarter, better
killers. Can’t be easy to live with.
BEKA
If you’re asking, do I feel guilt, well
I do. But not for the reasons you’d
understand.
ADAMA
Try me.
She eyes him for a beat, then asks a question of him instead.
BEKA
Do you feel guilty watching those snuff
films?

ADAMA
Why should I?
BEKA
‘Cause it turns war into an
entertainment. Trivializes death and
destruction. Sets it all to music, like
some cheesy holo-game.
ADAMA
That’s not why I watch.
BEKA
Of course not.
Adama bristles a bit, then tries to explain.
ADAMA
Look, I haven’t seen any ground combat
yet, but odds are I will. I thought
it’d be a good way to at least get a
feel for what it’s like. It’s even
helping me spot some of the Toasters’
weaknesses. Like how they’re programmed
to retrieve damaged units from the
battlefield, even under fire, probably
so they can salvage them for parts.
BEKA
Or maybe they just care about each
other, same as human soldiers. Makes
more sense than bad programming.
She almost smiles at his surprise.
BEKA (cont’d)
But I guess that never even occurred to
you.
(off his silence)
Don’t get me wrong, Mister Adama. I
know what side I’m on. But what’s the
point of winning if we become robots
ourselves?
Adama has no reply. Coker calls out from up front.
COKER
Hey, better get your asses up here.
We’re almost at the rendezvous
coordinates.
WITH COKER
As Adama and Beka join him, Adama taking his seat.

ADAMA
Dradis?
COKER
Clear.

Here we go. Contact. Colonial
transponder.
(then)
Wait, now I’m reading multiple
signatures.
ADAMA
Archeron might have support ships.
COKER
Then where are their transponders?
Something wrong with this picture.
BEKA
Break radio silence and hail them.
Coker and Adama share a look, that Adama nods.
COKER
Archeron/Colonial Raptor Niner-zeroniner.
Acknowledge.
Nothing but STATIC in response.
COKER (cont’d)
Archeron, this is Raptor Niner-zeroniner,
acknowledge and respond.
Suddenly, a BODY smacks off the canopy.
COKER (cont’d)
Shit!
(then)
Debris field!
And Adama maneuvers quickly to avoid chunks of DEBRIS
spiraling their way. He gets clear and now they get a good
look at the ARCHERON, or what’s left of it, broken into a few
big sections of fuselage and many smaller chunks of debris.
BEKA
Gods! Is that Archeron?
They fly by a big piece with the ship’s name on it.
COKER
Got your answer? Now get back there and
strap yourself in.

As she does, Adama weaves through the debris field.
ADAMA
Must’ve been ambushed. How long?
COKER
From the dispersal pattern, maybe hours.
Which means...
As if in confirmation, an ALARM SOUNDS.
COKER (cont’d)
Incoming!
Adama rocks the plane, narrowly avoiding a CYLON MISSILE,
which streaks past and EXPLODES against a piece of fuselage.
COKER (cont’d)
Got three Raiders inbound on our
starboard quarter. Targeting... Damn!
Auto-targeting isn’t responding. Can’t
get a lock!
ADAMA
Wait for a visual. There they are.
As we see three specks through the canopy, then...
43 INTERCUT: EXT. SPACE 43
As the three RAIDERS streak toward them in formation.
ADAMA
Switching to manual...
A HEADS-UP HOLO DISPLAY superimposes a targeting grid over
flickering WIRE FORM images of the Raiders.
Beka
The orders say we’re not supposed to
engage the enemy!
COKER
The godsdamn enemy engaged us, lady, and
in this bird we can’t outrun ‘em!
 Adama gets a lock on the lead Raider.
ADAMA
Tone. Firing.
The missile streaks away and destroys the lead Raider. It’s
two “wingmen” peel off in opposite directions.

42 CONTINUED: (3) 42

COKER
They’re splitting up!
ADAMA
Figured they would. Divide and conquer.
He takes off after one of the Raiders, which maneuvers
evasively, making it hard for him to get a lock.
ADAMA (cont’d)
C’mon, c’mon, hold still.
COKER
I don’t like the math on this. There’s
still two of ‘em and we only got one
missile left.
ADAMA
Then let’s make it count.
(gets target lock)
Gotchya!
He fires. The missile streaks away. Only just before it
reaches the Raider, a chunk of debris impacts it instead.
COKER
Damn it! Of all the frakked up --
In the back, Beka’s cool facade is starting to crack.
BEKA
What’s going on? What happened?
ADAMA
(working controls)
It’s all right, we’re fine.
COKER
Fine? What are you smoking?
(then, off monitor)
Second one’s coming around on us!
CANNON FIRE streaks by the Raptor. Adama breaks off. The
other Raider turns, too, both now streaking after the Weasel.
COKER (cont’d)
Two bandits, no missiles. Now I really
don’t like the math.
And as the Raptor streaks by camera, the two Raiders tight on
its heels, pouring on cannon fire...

44 EXT. SPACE/INT. RAPTOR 44
Adama weaves through debris but can’t shake the two Raiders. *
ADAMA
Where are they?
COKER
Glued to our six.
ADAMA
These two can actually fly. *
BEKA
I thought we couldn’t outrun them? *
COKER
We can’t.
BEKA
Then why are we trying?
COKER
‘Cause it beats the alternative. *
ADAMA
She’s right. We can’t keep this up *
forever.
Adama eyes the biggest chunk of wreckage -- the entire mid- *
section of the Archeron -- thinking quickly. *
ADAMA (cont’d)
Program one of the decoy drones with our
Dradis signature, then get ready to
deploy it on my mark.
COKER
What good’s that gonna do? They can see
our frakking plane.
ADAMA
Like I said, “divide and conquer.” *
He points the Raptor right at the middle of the big piece of
fuselage and now Coker gets the idea.
COKER
Fine. It’ll never work, but what the
frak.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 37.
(CONTINUED)
Coker works his panel as Adama whips the Raptor around to the *
far side of the big chunk of Archeron, barely missing twisted *
fingers of wreckage reaching out from the warship’s hull.
ADAMA
Mark!
Coker hits a control, and a DECOY DRONE is fired backwards,
retracing the Raptor’s course.
On the Dradis screen, it looks like two Raptors are now headed *
in opposite directions around the backside of the wreckage.
The two Raiders split up, pursuing the different signatures.
COKER
They took the bait.
Adama brings the Raptor to a stop, waiting.
BEKA
Why are we stopping?
This time, both men ignore her, Adama too focused on the fight
to offer any reassurance.
COKER
They realized it was a decoy. Coming at
us from both directions now.
ADAMA
Hang on, this is gonna be close. *
The two Raiders come streaking at them from both sides, firing
their cannons. Rounds nip at the Raptor’s fuselage. At the
last second, Adama punches the throttle and the Raptor darts
away, letting the Raiders get caught in their own crossfire.
They’re both destroyed.
COKER
Frak, yeah! Now get us the hell outta
here.
ADAMA
Read my mind.
He starts to turn, but suddenly an ALARM goes off and another
CYLON MISSILE comes at them. Adama narrowly avoids it, and it
EXPLODES against the wreckage. Coker eyes his Dradis.
COKER
Another Raider! Nine o’clock high, *
closing like a motherfrakker!

Adama’s expression gets grimmer. He works the helm, turning
his ship toward the new threat.
COKER (cont’d)
What’re you doing now? You’re headed
right at him!
ADAMA
These birds are supposed to be tough,
right?
COKER
All the armor plating in the worlds
won’t save our asses if you put us right *
in his sights.
ADAMA
Not the plan.
Adama spins the ship, dodging some of the Raider’s cannon
fire, and at the last second dips a wing, GOUGING a chunk out *
of the less heavily armored Raider as they flash by.
The Raider’s exposed systems SPARK and it tumbles out of *
control, smashing into another chunk of debris and exploding.
Coker turns to Adama, gives him a grudging nod.
COKER
Not bad, Husker. Stupid, but not bad.
Now let’s get our asses home.
ADAMA
No arguments here. *
(to Beka) *
You okay? *
(when she nods)
Don’t worry. We’ll get you back to
Galactica, safe and sound.
BEKA
We can’t go back. Not yet, anyway.
COKER
What?
Pulling herself together, she scribbles a number on a scrap of
paper, comes forward and hands it to him.
BEKA
I need you to send a simple hail on that
frequency. It shouldn’t take long for a
response.

COKER
Sorry, lady, but our job was to get you
here, and that job is over.
BEKA
Your orders also say you’re to assist me
in any way I deem necessary so long as
I’m aboard this ship.
COKER
The hell they do.
ADAMA
They do, partner.
(meeting his glare)
Send the message.
COKER
Sure. Let’s let every Toaster ship in
the sector know we’re here.
But he sends the message. A moment later, there’s an
answering PING.
COKER (cont’d)
What the frak?
ADAMA
We got a response already?
COKER
It’s like someone was camped out on that *
frequency, waiting.
BEKA
Someone was. What’s the message?
COKER
It’s coordinates.
(off console)
And these are in Cylon space.
BEKA
Then that’s where we’re going.
COKER
Okay, Lady, for now I’ll let you tell us
where to point this boat. But if this
next party’s a bust, we’re going back,
special orders or no special orders.
BEKA
I’ll be in back. Let me know when we’re
close.

44 CONTINUED: (3) 44
(CONTINUED)
She heads back. Coker looks at Adama, who just shrugs.
COKER
“Let me know when we’re close.” You
know, I’m starting to like her even less
than I like you.
And as sets them on their new course...
45 EXT. SPACE 45
The Raptor approaches a system comprised of a Jupiter-like
planet orbiting a dying red giant star that looks like a
pulsing heart as it ejects shells of gaseous material.
46 INT. WILD WEASEL 46
Adama eyes the planet while Coker checks his readings. *
ADAMA
That it?
COKER
Coordinates are on the far side of that
big rock.
ADAMA
Still nothing on Dradis?
COKER
No, but with all the radiation from that
red giant, Dradis ain’t worth shit. You
could hide a fleet of Base Stars in that
system.
(sighs)
Better wake up her holiness.
Adama makes his way back, ducking through the hatch to find *
Beka sleeping fitfully on a fold-out bunk.
ADAMA
Dr. Kelly?
(a little louder)
Dr. Kelly?
She doesn’t wake. Adama moves closer, realizes she’s in the
grip of some kind of nightmare, muttering to herself.
BEKA
No... don’t... don’t go...
For a moment he just watches the powerful emotions surge over
her features. Then he jogs her shoulder.

ADAMA
Beka?
She wakes with a start, staring at him with unfocused eyes and
an uncharacteristic vulnerability.
BEKA
What? Eyal...?
Then she gets her bearings and her guard goes up. *
BEKA (cont’d)
Oh, it’s you. Were you watching me?
ADAMA
No, I was just... You were talking in
your sleep.
BEKA
What did I say?
ADAMA
Nothing. You called me Eyal...
She drops her guard a bit. We may even sense relief. *
ADAMA (cont’d)
You don’t have to...
(implied: explain)
BEKA
Maybe I do. You’ve heard of Private
Barzel?
ADAMA
(”of course”)
He’s that old Marine who took out an
entire Cylon platoon single-handed,
before one of their snipers got him. A
lot of guys at the Academy signed up
because of him.
BEKA
It’s an inspiring story, but then Eyal
was an inspiring man... and a good
husband.
ADAMA
So that’s why you’re risking your neck
out here with us. This mission, it’s
payback for you.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 42.

BEKA
(quiet intensity)
It’s payback for him.
She goes to the front, Adama following and taking his seat.
COKER
Hope you had a nice snooze. We’re about
to see how much shit you got us into
this time.
ADAMA
Approaching coordinates.
They come around the gas giant and see an array of specks
glinting against the colorful backdrop, as the Dradis now
comes alive with multiple readings.
COKER
Dradis contact. Multiple readings.
ADAMA
It is a fleet.
A SCREEN flashes with GRAPHIC IMAGES of a variety of Colonial
ship types. Coker’s relief is palpable. *
COKER
Colonial transponders. It’s ours.
(re: approaching Vipers)
Looks like they’re sending a greeting
party.
47 EXT. SPACE/INT. RAPTOR 47
As the Raptor approaches a large MILITARY FLEET anchored by a
Battlestar (the Valkyrie, but we don’t see the name yet), the
Battlestar’s CAP of Vipers race out to intercept it.
Inside the Raptor, an ALARM goes off.
ADAMA
They’re coming in hot, weapons locked
on.
CAP LEADER (WIRELESS)
Unidentified Raptor, answer password
challenge “Spigot.”
Adama and Coker trade baffled looks.
COKER
What the frak?

ADAMA
This is Raptor Niner-zero-niner,
attached to the Battlestar Galactica. *
We don’t know about any password, but
we’re here on a special mission --
CAP LEADER (WIRELESS)
Repeat, challenge is “Spigot.” You have
five seconds to respond or we’ll open
fire. Five... four...
COKER
For Gods’ sake, we’re from
Galactica! No one told us any
damn password!
CAP LEADER (WIRELESS)
...three... two...
Suddenly, Beka reaches out and punches the wireless button.
BEKA
Arrow. I repeat, response is arrow. *
Adama and Coker look at her in surprise. A tense beat. *
CAP LEADER (WIRELESS)
Affirmative. Niner-zero-niner, follow
me to the outer marker, then contact the
LSO on frequency 134 for landing
instructions.
ADAMA
Roger that.
He follows the lead Viper while two others take up flanking
positions. Coker eyes Beka.
COKER
Might’ve mentioned that bit of business *
before we almost got our asses shot off,
you think? *
BEKA
Orders. Anything I tell you has to be *
on a “need-to-know” basis.
She seems genuinely regretful but Coker isn’t appeased. Adama *
peers at the Battlestar now looming up. *
ADAMA
That Battlestar, it looks like... it
is... it’s Valkyrie.
COKER
Can’t be. Valkyrie was destroyed at
Canceron Prime.

ADAMA
It was reported destroyed.
He notes a heavy cruiser they’re passing, the Loki.
ADAMA (cont’d)
And that heavy cruiser, that’s the Loki.
She was reported lost and presumed
destroyed, too.
(looking around)
I’m guessing the same goes for a lot of
these ships.
COKER
A frakking “ghost fleet” hiding out in *
Cylon space? Why? *
(to Beka)
I’d ask her, but I can guess her answer: *
we don’t “need” to know. *
In response, Beka just buckles herself into the back seat.
COKER (cont’d)
Yeah, right.
The Wireless crackles. *
RELIANT LSO (WIRELESS) *
Raptor Niner-zero-niner/Reliant. *
Maintain course and speed and prepare *

ADAMA *
A landing on what? All I see is space. *
Then the AFT LANDING BAY of an unlit ship OPENS: a Cheshire *
Cat grin hanging in the void. Then RUNNING LIGHTS, and we can *
make out a SUBMARINE-LIKE WARSHIP: long, dark, and forbidding, *
with torpedo-like tubes for launching Vipers in the bow. *
COKER *
Crap. A frakking half-pint. *
BEKA *
“Half-pint?” *

Orion-Class Assault Ship. Some people *

An anxious look from Coker. *
ADAMA (cont’d) *
Just frakking with you. *
He lines up with the Reliant’s stern, fires his thrusters, and *

You’re coming in too hot! *

At the last second, he fires the forward thrusters. The ship *

the reinforced bulkhead at the end of the bay. *
Coker exhales. Beka and Adama exchange conspiratorial smiles. *
48 INT. RELIANT - HANGAR BAY 48 *
Adama, Coker and Beka are hustled out of the Raptor by a bunch
of MARINES, their rifles leveled. Shouts of: “Geddown!
Geddown! Geddown!” “On your knees.” “Hands behind your
head!” Etc. *
As they comply, Adama notes DECKHANDS with WORK LIGHTS
crawling under the Raptor, checking the hull, while more
Marines rush into the cabin. Moments later:
RELIANT MARINE (O.S.) *
Clear up top! *
DECKHAND (O.S.) *
Clear below! *
ADAMA
What’re they looking for? Bombs?
COKER
Not exactly going all out to make us *
feel welcome, are they? Reminds me of
Colonial Day at my mother-in-law’s.
Which, despite the circumstances, piques Adama’s curiosity.
ADAMA
So you are married?
Coker looks away and grows taciturn again.
COKER
Was. Another life.
The ship’s XO arrives, looks to a Marine Sergeant.
MARINE SERGEANT
No heavy ordnance or explosives. Ship’s

Beka takes off her dogtag necklace, holds it out to him.
BEKA
Colonel, if you take these to your C.O.,
they’ll confirm my identity and mission.
The XO examines the tag suspiciously, then, to his Marines:
XO
They try anything stupid, shoot them.
Adama watches as the XO climbs a short flight of stairs to *
confers with the ship’s captain, COMMANDER OZAR, 40, a hard- *
looking ex-pilot and commando. *
Meanwhile, Coker is watching a Viper pilot (KIRBY) who’s being

COKER
Gods, that’s Jim Kirby.
ADAMA
Who?
COKER
That Viper jock. He was assigned to *
Valkyrie. Thought he was dead.
ADAMA

Good friend.

Jim! Jim Kirby, over here! *
The pilot gives Coker a brief look, then walks away.
ADAMA
Maybe he didn’t recognize you.
COKER
He recognized me all right. I don’t

Big offensives are where lots of people

The XO returns with the ship’s DOCTOR. He indicates Beka. *
XO
Check her out.
He doctor takes out a portable RETINAL SCANNING DEVICE and
crouches by the kneeling Beka. He runs the blue light over her

He’s about to move off when Adama quickly speaks up.
ADAMA
Sir, Ensign William Adama, Squadron VA-

Thanks, son, but I think we’ll use one

Coker’s relief is an easy match for Adama’s disappointment,

OZAR *
Good luck charms, eh? All right, have

Make sure the rest of the pilots are
volunteers, too. Dr. Kelly, you’re with

Coker isn’t having any of it, glaring at Adama.

Now it’s so deep in their space that
intel says it’s mostly unguarded: some
ground forces with support ships
visiting periodically, but no Base
Stars. A spec ops Marine Recon team has
already been inserted. Our job is to
deliver Dr. Kelly safely to the
operators, then bug out and let them
take her the rest of the way to her
objective.
COKER
And what is that objective, sir?
OZAR
Afraid I can’t tell you, Ensign, though
I can tell you that the entire course of
this war could hinge on her reaching it.
(eyes all of them)
I want all Vipers prepped by fourteen
hundred, tactical Jump to follow at
fifteen hundred. Sooner we do our jobs,
gentlemen, sooner we can break out the
hootch. I managed to “liberate” two
cases of ambrosia from Valkyrie’s mess.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 52.
(CONTINUED)
Whoops and hollers at that. Adama grins, enjoying the
camaraderie. Coker’s expression stays grim.
52 INT. RELIANT - HANGAR BAY 52
Reliant’s landing deck serves as its Hangar Bay when it’s
sealed, and it’s as cramped as Galactica’s is expansive, *
crowded with MARK III VIPERS: sleeker planes with bigger *
wings, designed for ground air support as well as space dog
fighting. Deckhands work with pilots to prep them. One is
already being hauled forward to a launch tube.
Finding Adama carefully painting the third of three Raider
symbols on the side of the Weasel’s hull. Elias, preflighting
his adjacent Viper, nods approvingly.
ELIAS
Nailed three of ‘em in that bucket?
Color me impressed.
ADAMA
Thanks. I’ll admit we got lucky.
ELIAS
Look around. Every one of these guys is
lucky. That’s why they’re still alive.
He claps a beaming Adama on the back. REVEALING COKER
watching this exchange as he uncrates some ordnance. Then he *
eyes Kirby, checking his Viper, and crosses to him. *
COKER
It is my old friend Jim Kirby, isn’t it,
or are my eyes going along with the rest
of me?
KIRBY
Coker, good to see you.
The two men embrace, as Coker observes: *
COKER
You saw me before.
KIRBY
Sorry, but you weren’t cleared yet and
they’ve got us under real strict orders.
Outside this fleet, we don’t exist.
COKER
I get it. It was a heckuva surprise,
though. Saw your name on the KIA list
back when Valkyrie supposedly bought it.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 53.
51 CONTINUED: 51
(CONTINUED)
KIRBY
We almost did. Ship was shot to hell. *
But when Command realized she could be
salvaged, they saw an opportunity.
COKER
Put together a fleet of “dead” ships,
hide ‘em in the Cylons’ backyard, then *
hit ‘em when and where they’re least
expecting it.
KIRBY *
They’ve been planning this attack for
over a year now. I’m guessing this
mission’s part of it. Talk about
creepy: they made us all witness our
own death certificates.
(beat)
“Give your all for the war,” right?
COKER
“Them or us,” yeah.
(beat) *
Guess being “dead” and all, you haven’t
been able to talk to Janey.
Kirby just gives him a dark look, goes back to working.
COKER (cont’d)
Yeah, well I did.
(off Kirby’s look)
Caught a coupla days leave on Picon a
while back. Figured I’d check in on
her, see how she’s holding up.
KIRBY *
So what are you gonna tell me now?
She’s remarried? Not that I’d blame
her, just this frakking war.
COKER
Nah. She’s on her own. Well, not
exactly on her own...
(beat)
She’s got a kid.
KIRBY
(stunned)
A kid? What’re you talking about?
COKER
A boy. He’s got her nose and hair...
and your eyes.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 54.
52 CONTINUED: 52
(CONTINUED)
And only then does it really hit Kirby.
KIRBY
Wait... you’re saying...
(as Coker grins)
I’ve got a son? That’s what you’re
telling me, right? I’ve got a son.
COKER
Name’s Anslem.
KIRBY
That was her dad’s name. Musta happened
my last leave. But we talked maybe a
month later and she didn’t even know she
was pregnant.
(then)
I’ve really got a son? You’re not
shitting me?
Coker just gives him a look: “C’mon.” And Kirby grabs him in *
a bear hug, half lifts him off his feet, laughing as he dances
Coker around.
KIRBY (cont’d)
You motherfrakker! I’ve got a son.
I’ve got a frakking son!
COKER
Whoa! Whoa!
But his own eyes look troubled, as if he can’t completely
share in the good news he’s just delivered.
ON ADAMA
He was approaching with a checklist, but seeing Coker and
Kirby sharing this moment, he stops, then finds himself
watching, realizing there’s clearly more to his perpetually
angry partner than he may have realized.
OZAR (INTERCOM)
This is the Commander. Thirty minutes
to combat Jump. All pilots to their
planes. Action stations, set Condition
One throughout the ship.
And as the Hangar Bay scrambles to life...
KIRBY
Impulsively grabs the can of black paint Adama used to ink his
little Raiders and starts blacking out the call sign,
“Goldbrick,” on his Viper. OFF which...
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 55.
52 CONTINUED: (2) 52
53 INT. RELIANT - SERIES OF CUTS 53
- Vipers being loaded into the forward-facing launch tubes.
- Adama, Coker and Beka, strapping in aboard the Raptor, which
is still in the Landing Bay but now facing the closed outer
doors. Adama shuts his visor with a click.
- Kirby in his Viper. (Note: We don’t see his call sign.)
54 INT. RELIANT - CIC 54
Again, a mini version of Galactica’s, though everything here
has a stealthier, more “submarine” feel, with blue LEDs
glowing coolly in the dark. Ozar picks up a handset.
OZAR
Jump.
55 EXT. SPACE - RELIANT 55
Jumps out... then winks in again, this time on the dark side
of the moon, Djerba, in orbit around a large ringed planet.
56 INTERCUT: INT. RELIANT - CIC 56
Ozar, his XO and several other officers and enlisted personnel
watch the Dradis and external video feeds.
XO
Jump complete. No Dradis contacts.
Approaching launch window in ten...
nine... eight... seven...
And Reliant comes around the nighttime curve of the planet and
sunlight reveals dense cloud cover over an icy, mountainous *
surface far below -- and a BASE STAR directly in its path. *
XO (cont’d)
Dradis contact! Base Star bearing twoseven-five
carom four-one-two, range two
thousand -- inbound.
OZAR
Shit. Have they made us yet?
XO
No... still haven’t scrambled their
Raiders. But even in stealth mode,
they’re gonna pick us up on Dradis soon,
and they’ll definitely see us if we
launch. We can still abort.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 56.
(CONTINUED)
A tense beat as Ozar considers, feeling the weight of the
worlds on his shoulders. Then:
OZAR
Marines are waiting. Timing’s
everything with this op. We’ve got no
choice.
(picks up receiver)
This is the Commander.
57 VARIOUS ANGLES 57
Pilots listening in their Vipers; Adama, Coker and Beka in the
Raptor.
OZAR (WIRELESS)
We just ran into some unexpected
company: a Base Star. We’ve got no
choice but to go ahead and launch, but
I’m calling an audible: Kirby, Elias,
you accompany the Raptor down. The rest
of you jocks run interference, try to
keep any Raiders from going after them.
We’ll engage the Base Star. Good luck,
and good hunting.
(to XO)
Activate all batteries and arm the
nukes.
58 EXT. SPACE - RELIANT 58
Gun and missile ports open on the hull.
59 INT. RELIANT - CIC 59
The XO reacts to his Dradis.
RELIANT XO
They’ve seen us. They’re launching
Raiders.
OZAR
Launch.
RELIANT XO
(to headset)
Launch all planes!
60 EXT. SPACE - RELIANT 60
Vipers shoot out of the forward tubes, the main body streaking
to meet the incoming Raiders while two, Kirby’s and Elias’s, *
wheel around to the stern of the ship to meet --
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 57.
56 CONTINUED: 56
61 INT. RELIANT - HANGAR BAY/INT. WILD WEASEL 61
Adama and Coker watching through the canopy as the bay doors
open to space. Adama’s expression acknowledges the gravity of
the situation as he works the controls.
ADAMA
Here we go.
The Raptor lifts slightly off the deck, tilts its nose down,
then barrels out of the bay.
62 INT. RELIANT - CIC 62
RELIANT XO
Raptor’s away.
OZAR
Let’s see if we can’t give them some
more cover. Open fire with all
batteries.
63 EXT. SPACE 63
Reliant and the Base Star’s exchange fire, while its *
outnumbered Vipers engage the Raiders and the Weasel, joined *
by Kirby’s and Elias’s Vipers, dive toward the surface. *
64 INT. WILD WEASEL 64
Coker’s Dradis shows the battle they’re leaving behind: a
handful of Vipers amidst a swarm of Raider symbols.
COKER
Poor bastards are outnumbered ten to
one. They’ll never make it.
ADAMA
Let’s hope we do. *
65 EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE 65
Overlapping wireless chatter as the Viper pilots take on the
Raiders, inflicting serious damage despite being outnumbered.
PILOT #1 (WIRELESS)
Hump, you got two your six!
Break!Break!Break!
PILOT #2 (WIRELESS)
Digger, got three rolling our
way, stay on my wing!
PILOT #3 (WIRELESS)
Nailed that bastard, breaking
right!
PILOT #4 (WIRELESS)
Stick with your wingman!
Watch your intervals!
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 58.
(CONTINUED)
Then a Viper gets taken out and TWO RAIDERS scream past it,
diving for the surface.
PILOT #2 (WIRELESS)
Digger bought it! Got two bandits
headed for the deck. *
PILOT #3 (WIRELESS)
Let ‘em go. Got our hands full up here.
66 INT. RELIANT - CIC 66
Rocked by gun and missile fire from the Base Star.
RELIANT XO
We’re down two planes. Can’t keep those
Raiders bottled up any longer.
OZAR
(a beat, then)
Fire the nukes.
RELIANT XO
At this range? We may not be able to
clear the blast.
OZAR
No choice. Do it!
The XO works a console, only --
RELIANT XO
No go. Bay doors are jammed.
OZAR
Then take us in, we’ll trigger them
manually.
Looks. The crew all knows what this means.
RELIANT XO
Affirmative.
67 EXT. SPACE 67
And as Reliant plows toward the Base Star as the two ships
continue to exchange artillery and missile fire...
68 EXT. ICY MOON - ATMOSPHERE 68 *
The Weasel and its guardians slice through the cloud cover. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 59.
65 CONTINUED: 65
69 INT. WILD WEASEL 69
Buffeting. Adama’a display shows hidden mountain peaks. *
ADAMA
Clouds are hiding a lot of crap. This *
won’t be easy. *
COKER
Now he gets humble. Just get us down in
one piece, Husker!
(then, off Dradis)
Contact! Look out, guys, Two... no, *
three bandits! Two klicks and closing.
70 INT. KIRBY’S VIPER 70
Kirby looks back, sees only mist.
KIRBY
It’s like pea soup, can’t... Wait, got *
‘em! Seven o’clock high!
71 EXT. ICY MOON - ATMOSPHERE 71 *
The three Raiders materialize out of the cloud cover above and *
behind the Colonial ships.
72 EXT. ELIAS’S VIPER 72
Call sign “Spoon” on his Viper.
ELIAS
Better take us down. Betting those
things can’t handle in atmosphere.
ADAMA (WIRELESS)
Roger that.
73 EXT. MOON - ATMOSPHERE/INT. WEASEL, VIPERS 73 *
The Raptor leads the Vipers lower. But now the Raiders sprout
ailerons and flaps, transforming from a familiar type of ship
into something brand new, and dive after them.
74 EXT. SPACE - RELIANT 74
Badly damaged, fires breaking out on its hull as it continues
to plow through heavy artillery and missile fire toward the
Base Star, while Raiders make passes at it as well.
RELIANT XO
All our Vipers are gone. Distance to
target two klicks.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 60.
(CONTINUED)
OZAR
Give me manual override on the nukes.
RELIANT XO
You have it. 500 meters.
Ozar flips up a protective cover on a red toggle switch, then
looks at his crew.
OZAR
It was an honor, gentlemen.
He flips the toggle.
75 EXT. SPACE 75
Reliant plows into the Base Star and its nukes detonate, the
huge blast taking out both ships and the shock wave
obliterating all the Raiders.
76 INT. WILD WEASEL 76
As Coker reacts to a screen.
COKER
Nuke just went off. Lost Dradis contact
with Reliant and the Base Star.
Looks exchanged. Adama is stunned at the loss of life.
COKER (cont’d)
Keep a grip, kid.
77 EXT. MOON - ATMOSPHERE 77 *
The two Raiders drop in behind the Colonial ships and open
fire. INTERCUTTING Viper and Raptor interiors as needed:
KIRBY (WIRELESS)
Looks like you lost that bet, Spoon.
Those bandits are right up our asses!
Weasel, we’re gonna have to roll out to
get behind them. Hang tough.
The two Vipers roll left and right, dropping back behind the
Raiders, which continue to race after the Raptor, firing.
ADAMA
I can do better than that. Taking her
down.
He drops the Raptor through the clouds, dodging the jagged *
peaks while taking cannon fire from the pursuing Raiders that *
rocks them and causes sparks to fly from Beka’s console. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 61.
74 CONTINUED: 74
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA (cont’d)
Beka!
She grabs a fire extinguisher, puts out the flames.
BEKA
I’m all right.
COKER
(to com)
Little help, guys, we’re getting our
asses kicked here!
Suddenly, the Vipers swoop in and take out all three Raiders! *
KIRBY (WIRELESS)
Got em! Clean sweep.
Elias whoops over the com. But now ANOTHER RAIDER drops in *
from behind and takes out his plane and damages Kirby’s. *
KIRBY (WIRELESS) (cont’d)
Elias is down and I’m hit... frakking
guns jammed... Shit...
His mind races... he briefly closes his eyes. Then, quietly:
KIRBY (cont’d)
Sorry, Coker. I’m going home.
Then he opens his eyes and, with agonized resolve, yanks his
stick hard over, veering away from the fight. In the Weasel: *
COKER
Say again, Kirby. I didn’t copy.
(then, off Dradis)
What the--?! He’s bugging out!
78 INT. KIRBY’S VIPER 78
as it screams into space, Kirby white-knuckling the controls. *
COKER (WIRELESS)
Kirby?! Jim?! Godsdamnit, our ass is
hanging out here! Kirby! Respond!
Kirby doesn’t respond, and only now do we pull back and see *
the new call sign he’s painted in crude white letters over the *
blacked-out old one. His son’s name. “ANSLEM.”
79 INT. WILD WEASEL/EXT. MOON’S ATMOSPHERE 79 *
The ship shakes as the Raider strafes it from behind.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 62.

ADAMA
Where is he?
COKER
Gone. He just --
ADAMA
-- Not your friend, dammit, the bandit!
Coker pulls it together, checks his instruments.
COKER
200 meters. Dead on our six.
ADAMA
Good.
He reverses thrust, “slamming on the brakes” and causing the *
pursuing Raider to almost plow into their stern. *
COKER
Ten meters!
Adama hits the afterburners and the WEASEL’S ENGINES FLARE, *
BURNING through the Raider’s canopy and BLOWING IT UP. *
COKER (cont’d)
Scratch one Raider!
The Weasel rockets forward, Adama wrestling with the controls. *
ADAMA
Hydraulics are shot. Losing attitude *
control. *
COKER
We lost the left engine!
Through the canopy, the ground is rushing up. *
ADAMA
Afraid this won’t be pretty.
80 EXT. MOON - DAY 80 *
As the smoking Raptor clips a ridge, then toboggans down a *
steep slope until an avalanche of snow WHITES OUT the screen. *
END OF ACT FIVE *

79 CONTINUED: 79
ACT SIX
81 EXT. MOON - DAY 81 *
Finding the Raptor half buried in snow, its hull scorched and *
pocked from cannon fire. Light snow gusts through frame. *
A GLOVED HAND brushes snow away from a HANDHELD DISPLAY, *
revealing a topographical map with a blinking blue dot, *
indicating our position, and a red dot some distance away. *
REVEAL BEKA studying it while Adama crouches to check the *
contents of a backpack. They’re wearing white military parka *
shells, goggles and ice axes in their belts. Coker approaches *
from the Raptor, which is a short distance away (VFX). *
COKER
Com’s shot and the nav system’s a mess,
but if I can get that left engine back *
on line, we should be able to get her *
off the ground. *
ADAMA
(dubious)
We’ve got multiple hull breaches.
COKER
Yeah, well I’ve been flying this bird
for a lot longer than you, so why don’t
you stop bitching and start patching? *
ADAMA
Maybe you forgot, but our mission is to *
get Dr. Kelly to her rendezvous.
ADAMA (cont’d)
(to Beka) *
How far?
COKER
Our mission?
Beka
About five klicks, but in *
these conditions that could *
take a while to cover.
COKER *
Are you out of your frakking
mind? *
She and Adama start to put on their packs, *
COKER
You know how many people were on that
ship? I’m talking to you! Do you?!
ADAMA
Typical crew compliment of an Orion
class ship is about a hundred and fifty,
not counting the pilots.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 64.
(CONTINUED)
COKER
Well count the pilots, ‘cause you can
bet they’re all dead now too, thanks to *
this “mission” of hers! And we still
don’t even know why, ‘cept maybe so you
can paint some more little “merit
badges” on the side of my ship!
ADAMA
Get your pack. We’re moving out.
COKER
We ain’t moving anywhere ‘less I say so,
Husker!
ADAMA
You know, I’m getting tired of that
name...
COKER
If the shoe fits...
ADAMA
...And I’m really getting tired of your
frakked-up attitude.
COKER
My attitude?!
ADAMA
That’s right. So your friend’s dead. A *
lot of people are dead. But they all
knew what they were getting into and
why. So why don’t you just soldier up *
and stop whining like a chickenshit *
short-timer who can’t wait to let *
everyone else fight this war for him.
COKER
A week out of flight school and you’re
calling me yellow?! *
ADAMA
If the shoe fits...
They’re about to come to blows when Beka shoves them apart. *
BEKA
Hey... Hey! GROW UP PEOPLE! You want
to go home? The fastest way to do that
is to find those Marines.

ADAMA
(calming down)
She’s right. They’ll have their own
extraction plan. We can piggyback with
them.
He holds out a pack to Coker, and after a beat the other man
takes it. Then Coker eyes the battered Weasel, and we realize
that some of his anger was about abandoning his plane.
COKER
She may not look like much now, but that
bird kept me safe for a buncha years.
Hate leaving her like this.
ADAMA
I know.
Off the painted name on the scarred hull, as they head out...
82 EXT. MOON - GLACIER - DAY - SERIES OF CUTS 82 *
of our trio traversing a glacier. CRAMPONS and ICE AXES dig *
into the icy crust. Leaping a deep CREVASSE. Adama reaches *
out to steady Beka. A beat of eye contact between them, then *
Beka takes a new GPS reading while Coker shakes his canteen. *
COKER *
Frozen solid. Frakking great. *
ADAMA *
I hear alcohol has a much lower freezing *
point than water. *
Coker eyes him, then digs out his flask, shakes it. Smiles. *
COKER *
First intelligent thing you’ve said. *
Peace offering accepted. Beka looks up from her screen. *
BEKA *
Signal’s strong. They must be just up *

83 EXT. MOON - GLACIER - A SHORT TIME LATER 83 *
They stop at a place higher up on the glacier, the incline a *
bit steeper. Beka scans around with her device, which is now *
beeping like a range-finder. She’s puzzled. *
BEKA *
They should be here. *
They look around, then Adama eyes some loose snow, noting an *
odd shape just underneath. He brushes it off, revealing the *
ravaged, frost-bitten face of a dead Marine. Adama’s sharp *
intake of breath draws the others over, as a GUST now whips *
the snow off FOUR MORE BODIES half-embedded into the glacier. *
All bear savage slashing wounds, now frozen open. *
BEKA (cont’d) *
Gods. *
Adama finds a WRIST TRANSPONDER on one Marine. *
ADAMA *
Transponder’s still broadcasting. *
COKER *
What happened to them? These aren’t *
gunshot wounds. *
There’s a high keening SOUND in the distance. *
COKER (cont’d) *
What the frak was that? *
Adama raises his BINOCULARS, scans the snowy landscape. *
BINOCULAR POV: Something is approaching. Several things: *
alarming humps burrowing toward them through the snow. *

We’ve got company. Can’t tell what they *

Adama glances up the slope, sees a rocky outcropping. *
ADAMA *
Whatever they are, we’ve got a better *
chance of making a stand if we can get *
to those rocks. C’mon! *
They scramble up the slope, digging in with their axes and *
crampons, but the humps are gaining on them. One of them *
rears out of the snow, revealing itself to be giant SNAKE-LIKE *
ARMORED CREATURES. It hisses at them. *
COKER *
Sweet Gods! *
Coker pulls his sidearm and SHOOTS wildly, but the couple of *
rounds that hit just glance off the armor. *
COKER (cont’d) *
Frakking thing’s bulletproof! *
The “snake” plunges back into the snow, joining its comrades *
in making beeline furrows right at them. *
ADAMA *
Move it! *
They climb faster but the things are almost at their heels. *
BEKA *
We’re not gonna make it. *
She slips and falls. Adama throws himself over her while *
scrabbling for his sidearm, only to have something erupt from *
the snow right in front of him. He glimpses fierce eyes -- *
and the business end of a big COMBAT SHOTGUN. *
One of the snakes is rearing back to strike. BOOM! Its head *
is blown off. BOOM! BOOM! The other two are shredded and *
fall. Marine Recon Sergeant ELIAS TOTH glowers at them. *

COKER *
We almost didn’t. What the hell are *
those things? *
Toth crouches and slashes open one of the dead “snakes” with a *
knife, exposing slabs of muscle, and servos. *
TOTH *
Toasters have been using this place to *
experiment with cyborg critters: half *
machine, half organic, and very hard to *
kill -- without the right weapon. *
He indicates his bad-ass shotgun, on which he’s painted, “This *
machine kills machines,” then cuts off a hunk of meat and *
takes a bite. *
TOTH (cont’d) *
Good eating, though.
He offers up a bloody chunk on the tip of his knife.
ADAMA
Thanks, maybe later.
TOTH *
Sorry I couldn’t get to you quicker *
after I saw your signal. Cylons have *
broken our transponder encryption. *
Speaking of which, who’s got that bitch? *
Beka takes off a BLINKING WRIST TRANSPONDER, hands it to Toth. *

TOTH *
Yeah, well, that’s gonna have to wait a *

this crap than we do. *
BEKA *
I’ve got a timetable. We can’t just -- *

It’ll blow over by morning, and I’ve got *

Hey, hold on! We didn’t sign on for *

Like I said. Let’s get going. *
He heads off. As Adama helps a still stunned Coker up... *

84 CONTINUED: 84
85 EXT. MOON - SKI RESORT - EVENING 85 *
A sleekly modern, low-slung Frank Gehry-like building with a *
swooping domed roof, perched on the edge of a cliff. Our *
people approach, seen in a high angle at first. *
COKER *
This is your secure location? A *
frakking ski lodge? *
TOTH *
Four stars and all the comforts -- *
unless you count heat, power and running *
water. More importantly, it’s *
defensible. Cliffs on three sides. *
I’ve got tripwires and mines all around *
the entrance, so stay in my tracks if *
you’re fond of your extremities. And *
don’t mind the heads. *
He heads off. Coker turns to Adama, rubbing his sore neck. *
COKER *
The heads? Is it just me or is he wired *
a little tight? *
ADAMA *
It’s just you. *
And as Adama and Beka start to follow in Toth’s footsteps, *
Coker hangs back a beat, still troubled. *
86 EXT. SKI RESORT - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER 86 *
Close on a grisly sight: frozen human heads impaled on the *
tips of skis by the entrance. Coker, Adama and Beka react. *
COKER *
Gods of frakking Kobol. *
ADAMA *
Why’d they do this? To scare us? *
COKER *
(disagreeing) *
They wouldn’t be counting on anyone *
coming back here. *
BEKA *
You’re right. They didn’t do this to *
scare us off. They did it because they *
hate us. *
She heads inside, Adama and Coker following after a beat. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 71.
87 EXT. RESORT COMPLEX - ATRIUM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 87 *
Adama, Coker and Beka join Toth just inside the entrance, *
taking in the ruined but still impressive interior. At one *
point, the greenhouse-like dome sheltered an indoor tropical *
paradise: palms surrounding a lagoon-like pool. Now the *
plants are covered with frost, the pool frozen, holes in the *
roof allowing snow to drift over much of the courtyard. *
TOTH *
There’s some food left in the kitchen *
freezer, and some of the bigger suites *
have gas fireplaces. Also got a *
generator hooked up, so there’s minimal *
power. Just don’t go turning on to many *
lights, for obvious reasons. *
BEKA *
Those people outside... shouldn’t we *
bury them or something?
Adama doesn’t need Toth to answer that for them. *
ADAMA
Cylons see they’re gone, they’ll know *
we’re here.
Toth nods, tosses Adama a RIFLE from a stash by the door. *
TOTH *
Just in case. Controlled bursts. We’re *
low on ammo. *
Adama locks and loads. Beka walks off in a huff. *
TOTH (cont’d) *
Yeah, well. I’ll take first watch. *
Anyone wants to grab some rack time, *
now’s your chance. *
88 EXT. SKI RESORT - NIGHT 88 *
The storm, now a blizzard, all but obscuring the complex. *
89 INT. RESORT SUITE - NIGHT 89 *
A FIRE burns in a GAS HEARTH. Icicles drip onto a pile of *
food cans. Snow covers an infant-sized shape in a CRIB. BEKA *
lifts a frozen blanket to reveal... a DOLL. *
There’s a CHILDREN’S BOOK beside it. The cover shows a young *
boy walking along hand-in-hand with a small bowling-pin-shaped *
robot. The title: “Serge’s Big Day.” *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 72.
(CONTINUED)
Beka smiles wistfully at this memento of a more innocent time. *
A page is bookmarked with a 3D PHOTO of a FAMILY -- young *
parents, their pre-teen son and infant daughter -- sitting at *
a table by the hotel’s pool in their snow-encrusted SKI *
CLOTHES and BOOTS. The dad grins as he gestures to the pool *
and palm trees: the over-the-top craziness of it all. *
ADAMA (O.S.) *
You all right?
He’s been standing in the doorway. Unclear for how long.
BEKA
A family was staying here. The parents *
look so young and happy, like they can’t *
believe how lucky they are. *
Adama nods, but something else is on his mind.
ADAMA
What’s this all about?
She’s flipping through the innocent images in the kids’ book. *
BEKA
What do you mean?
ADAMA
You know what I mean. This mission.
BEKA
Sorry, but I still can’t -- *
ADAMA
Toth is the only one left who knows the *
score. At this point, don’t you think *
Coker and I “need to know,” too? *
BEKA
Your friend will be happy if he lives *
through this. You’re the only one who
needs to know. So why now? Why this
sudden need?
Adama finds he can’t quite meet her penetrating look.
BEKA (cont’d)
Did it get too real for you? Hard *
pretending it’s just an adventure or a *
“game” when actual people start dying. *
ADAMA
I never thought of it as a game. It’s *
war, and people die in war. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 73.
89 CONTINUED: 89
(CONTINUED)
BEKA
Oh, yes, and “All for the war.” “Them or
us,” right? Only their little slogans
aren’t doing it for you any more, are *
they? Now you need a real reason
because otherwise this -- *
(gesturing around)
-- all of this, stops making sense. And *
what am I supposed to tell you? What is
it, exactly, that you want me to
justify?!
And Adama sees that she’s crying. His expression turns
sympathetic, only that’s the one thing that Beka can’t take
right now. She turns away, her shoulders trembling. He puts *
his hands on her shoulders. A beat, then she fiercely grips
one of his hands, then kisses it and holds it to her face, as
if trying to inhale some essence of him, or of something lost
long ago. He turns her to him and she looks at him with a mix
of guilt and need.
BEKA (cont’d)
You’re going to regret this.
ADAMA
No, I won’t.
The SEX that follows starts off gently enough, a respite from
the violence and deathn, but soon becomes something else, *
something darker. Beka half fucks him, half fights him, as if *
seeking some kind of catharsis, or self-punishment, and Adama *
responds in kind. *
AFTERWARDS, they lie sweat-sheened on a pile of blankets by *
the fire, Beka with her back. His fingers idly twine with *
hers and he notes the lighter band of skin on her ring finger. *
ADAMA (cont’d)
What was he like?
BEKA *
A lot like you in some ways.
Idealistic. Ambitious. Older, but he
always seemed boyish to me.
ADAMA
A computer nerd, like you?
BEKA *
A professor... an historian who woke up *
one day decided he couldn’t sit back and *
just watch history happen anymore. *

(CONTINUED)
He never wanted to be a hero, but they
made him one anyway. Slapped his face *
on recruiting posters All but *
resurrected him in V-World.
ADAMA
I remember that.
BEKA
What you don’t remember, because they
never let it out, is that afterwards a
reporter found out it was all a *
fabrication. A lie. He didn’t take out *
any Cylon platoon. His scouting party
was shot up by men from his own unit.
Adama lifts up on an elbow, looks at her in surprise.
BEKA (cont’d)
“Friendly fire.” I’d like to know what
genius flack coined that phrase. But *
then like you said, it’s a war. Scared *
people with guns. “Shit happens.” *
ADAMA
You said this was payback for him.
BEKA
It’s the lies, more than anything, even
the killing and destruction. What
they’re doing to us. This war has to
end.
(turning to him, eyes
brimming again)
You wanted to know what this is about?
Well that’s what it’s about for me. You
need more, then find your own reasons
because that’s all I can tell you.
He nods and kisses her. And as they begin to make love again,
more tenderly this time...
STILL LATER
Adama wakes. Beka is still sleeping with her back to him. He *
kisses her shoulder gently, then hears faint strains of PIANO *
MUSIC coming from somewhere in the hotel and reaches for his *
fatigues.
REVERSE on Beka as he dresses in the background, somewhat out
of focus. Her eyes are open.

BEKA (cont'd)
90 INT. SKI RESORT - PIANO BAR - NIGHT 90 *
Lit by candles and lanterns. A row of shot glasses are lined *
up atop the piano, each beside a fancy bottle of booze. *
Someone is playing the piano: a mournful but haunting melody. *
At one point, a man’s left hand reaches up and takes one of
the glasses, while the right hand continues playing melody.
REVEAL COKER at the piano, playing and drinking, a rifle *
leaning against the nearby bar. He glances up as Adama enters
and comes over. He downs the drink and keeps playing.
COKER
Back home, I couldn’t afford any of this *
stuff. Figured it’d be a crime to let
it go to waste.
Adama listens to him play for a bit, impressed.
ADAMA
You said you were gonna be a musician.
COKER
I don’t take requests, ‘case you’re
wondering. This is pretty much the only
tune I remember.
ADAMA
(re: one of the glasses)
May I?
COKER
Help yourself. Just show some respect
and don’t frakking sip it.
Adama downs the shot, then studies the bottle.
ADAMA
Damn. That was somethin’.
COKER
You had to frak her, didn’t you?
(when Adama doesn’t reply)
Dumb, Husker. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
ADAMA
Wasn’t like that. It just... happened.
COKER
Oh, I guarantee you, whatever it was
like, it did not “just happen.” Case in *
point: I don’t suppose she told you *
what we’re doing here.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 76.
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA
She did. Kinda.
(beat)
She lost her husband. He was a --
Suddenly, Coker wings his shot glass across the room.
COKER
-- Her husband?! Her frakking husband?
You know how many people died to get us
this far?! Do you? So screw her
husband and whatever sorry tale of
personal woe she saw fit to “share” with
you, which, along with a frak, is all
you got outta her, isn’t it?!
ADAMA
You’re outta line, man.
COKER
No, you’re outta line, Husker. You’re
so far outta line you can’t even see
where the frakking line is! *
91 EXT. SKI RESORT - PRE-DAWN 91 *
The blizzard rages. A point of red light emerges from the *
swirling snow and a shape resolves into a CYLON CENTURION. *
Its WHITE “camo” armor TURNS SILVER as its eye roves back and *
forth warily, then it takes another step forward. *
CLOSE ON: a TRIPWIRE half buried in the snow. The Cylon’s *
“ankle” comes in contact with it, seems about to trip it. *
Then the machine stops. *
CLOSE ON THE CYLON as it crouches and gently touches the wire, *
examining it thoughtfully, or so we might sense. ANOTHER *
CENTURION steps up beside. The two machines exchange looks. *
92 INT. RESORT - PIANO BAR 92
Adama and Coker still arguing.
ADAMA
She’ll tell us the rest when and if we
need to know.
COKER
You don’t get it. I don’t care. I
don’t want to know. I just want --
BOOM! An explosion outside. Then another. The mines. *

COKER (cont’d)
Frak.
He grabs his rifle, Adama unslings his. He’s about to rush
out the door when Coker, hating himself for saying this, for
even thinking it, grabs him --
COKER (cont’d)
Better tell your girlfriend to stay put. *
Don’t need her getting in the way of a *
bullet. *
As Adama nods and runs back the way he came...
93 INT. SKI RESORT - ENTRANCE - PRE-DAWN 93 *
Toth is crouched behind a barricade of snow-dusted sandbags, *
just inside the entrance, as he fires bursts into the storm, *
targeting the MUZZLE FLASHES of unseen Cylon attackers. *
REVEALING the LOCATION TRANSPONDER lying on the snow beside *
him. It’s been switched on, the display blinking. *
And off Toth’s savage smile as he fires off another burst... *

ACT EIGHT
94 INT. SKI RESORT - ATRIUM - PRE-DAWN 94 *
Adama and Coker dash over and join Toth, who’s reloading while *
Cylon fire slams into his sandbag barricade. *
ADAMA *
How many? *
TOTH *
If this is the same patrol I’ve been *
surveilling, there should be four. *
But mines may’ve gotten a few ‘cause *
now I’m only seeing one muzzle flash. *
More automatic weapons fire peppers the barricade. Coker *
ducks, then notices the blinking transponder. *
COKER *
What the frak is this? *
Toth doesn’t respond, just fires off another burst. *
COKER (cont’d) *
You crazy bastard! You brought them *
right to us, didn’t you? *
TOTH *
Figured we’d have to deal with ‘em *
sooner or later. *
COKER *
Bullshit! You wanted this fight! *
Payback for your buddies, isn’t it? *
Isn’t it?! *
Toth doesn’t answer, as another burst hits the barricade. He *
targets a muzzle flash, fires back, as we CUT AWAY TO... *
95 EXT. SKI RESORT - CONTINUOUS 95 *
...and see the source of the muzzle flashes: two automated *
machine guns on tripods, no actual Cylons in evidence. *
96 INT. ATRIUM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 96 *
Toth fires another burst at the twin muzzle flashes. *
TOTH *
No one deserves to die like that. Cut *
to pieces by those... things. *
COKER *
Well now you’ve killed us, too! *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 79.
(CONTINUED)
TOTH *
(turning to him) *
I said there’s just a couple left, so *
why don’t you stop bitching and start -- *
A BURST of fire from inside the complex tears into Toth. He *
screams as Adama and Coker wheel, spot a CYLON about to fire *
again. They return fire, only the Cylon ducks behind cover. *
ADAMA *
They’re inside our perimeter! They were *
pinning us down here as a distraction. *
They turn to find Toth struggling to use his teeth and one *
hand to a to wrap a tourniquet around the bloody stump of his *
other arm, which has been blown off above the elbow. A leg *
has been blown off above the knee. *
COKER *
Gods! *
Coker grabs starts tying another tourniquet around Toth’s leg. *
There’s a familiar distant keening SOUND and answering cry. *
ADAMA *
More of those things. We gotta get him *
outta here! *
But Toth, though half in shock, resists fiercely. *
TOTH *
No! I’ll deal with those frakkers. You *
go after the girl. *
He manages to shove his shotgun into Adama’s hands. *
TOTH (cont’d) *
She dies, it’s all for shit. *
(laughs) *
Frak it. It’s all bullshit anyway. *
Adama reacts to this eerie echo of Tornvald’s earlier cynical *
remark, as Toth turns painfully onto his stomach and aims his *
automatic rifle one-handed into the storm. *
TOTH (cont’d) *
C’mon you cocksuckers! Come to daddy! *
Adama and Coker exchange grave looks: Toth has clearly gone *
around the bend, and yet he’s sacrificing himself for them. *
Then they take off, running back into the complex... *

96 CONTINUED: 96
97 INT. RESORT SUITE - MOMENTS LATER 97 *
Adama and Coker enter the suite, guns leveled. It’s empty. *
ADAMA *
Beka?! Beka?! *
(looks around wildly) *
I told her to stay here. They musta *
found her and -- *
COKER *
Maybe not. No blood. You look inside, *
I’ll search the atrium. *
(then) *
Stay cool and keep you head down, okay? *
Adama nods, and they split up. *
98 INT. SKI RESORT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 98 *
Beka makes her way through the resort’s kitchen, dimly lit by *
just one flickering bulb, trying to stay as quiet as possible. *
She spots the partly open door to a large walk-in FREEZER: *
looks like a good place to hide. She steps inside, then turns *
at the SOUND of a Cylon moving in an adjoining hallway. *
Turning back she collides with -- *
A ZOMBIE-LIKE HUMAN BODY dangling upside down from a meat *
hook. She involuntarily emits a little SHRIEK, then clamps a *
hand over her mouth. Too late, as: *
99 INT. SKI RESORT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 99 *
A silver-armored CYLON turns, moves into the adjoining kitchen. *
100 INT. SKI RESORT - ANOTHER HALLWAY 100 *
ADAMA moves down the hallway, which is lit by a few flickering *
lights. He stops as he also hears the sound of a Cylon, only *
it’s unclear where it’s coming from. As he turns, covering *
both ends of the hallway, trying to locate the source... *
CLOSE ON: AN ELECTRICAL BREAKER BOX. A CYLON HAND rips the *
cover off, then jams its fingers into the wiring, creating a *
sparking SHORT CIRCUIT. *
BACK ON ADAMA, as the hallway lights go out. He’s startled, *
then listens more intently for a sound to locate his enemy. *
AT THE BREAKER BOX, the Cylon does something surprising. Its *
armor ripples as thousands of tiny facets, like snake scales, *
flipping over from silver to black. Then a BLACK VISOR lowers *
over its eye slit, hiding the roving red eye, along with the *
SOUND of its motion. It’s in “stealth mode.” We now begin to *
INTERCUT this sequence with what’s happening with Beka in: *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 81.
101 INT. SKI RESORT - FREEZER - CONTINUOUS 101 *
Beka is crouched behind some equipment, breathing heavily in *
fear. She hears Cylon footsteps coming closer, takes a breath *
and holds it, as a RED CYLON TARGETING BEAM slices through the *
dark, partly illuminating the freezer above her head. *
BACK WITH ADAMA, making his way cautiously through the pitch *
dark hallway. But meanwhile... *
A CYLON NIGHT-VISION POV is tracking him from some 30 feet *
behind, getting closer. *
INSERTS: Adama’s feet, moving quietly. Cylon feet, moving *
just even more quietly. The Cylon’s ARM extends. Small *
elements ratchet out of it with the tiniest of sounds -- a *
mouse pissing on cotton -- and assemble themselves into a GUN *
BARREL. CROSS HAIRS are superimposed on the NIGHT VISION POV *
of Adama’s back. *
BACK WITH BEKA, still holding her breath. The red beam stops *
slicing through the freezer, and she hears the sound of the *
Cylon starting to move away. She exhales as quietly as she *
can -- and a little cloud of FROSTED BREATH drifts upwards. *
THE CYLON turns, sees the frost particles curling through its *
laser sight, and moves toward it, raising its “gun arm.” *
BEKA panics and rushes from her hiding place only to stumble. *
The red beam finds her, chasing her as she scrabbles *
backwards. Meanwhile -- *
THE CYLON POV is now 10 feet behind ADAMA, who seems oblivious *
as he rounds a CORNER. *
ADAMA’S CYLON rounds the corner, gun arm extended, about to *
take its shot. Then it reacts to find the corridor empty. If *
Cylon body language can say “WTF?,” this one’s does. Its... *
INFRA-RED POV turns one way, then the other -- and finds *
itself staring right into ADAMA’S FACE AND RAISED SHOTGUN *
BARREL as he steps from a doorway. BOOM! The POV goes dark. *
IN THE FREEZER, the other Cylon’s targeting beam has found *
Beka who’s backed up against a wall. The beam travels up her *
sternum until it reaches her high-tech “dog tag”,” just as -- *
COKER bursts into the freezer and sees the Cylon standing over *
Beka, its laser sight REFRACTING off her “dog tag. The Cylon *
seems to hesitate, it’s eye briefly stops oscillating, as if *
it’s reacting to something. And in that moment -- *
COKER *
Hey! *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 82.
(CONTINUED)
Lightning fast, the Cylon pivots with its weapon, as we CUT *
TO: *
THE HALLWAY, where Adama is standing over his dead Cylon. Then *
he reacts to a BURST OF GUNFIRE from the direction of the *
kitchen and rushes toward the sound, as we end the INTERCUT. *
102 INT. SKI RESORT - KITCHEN/FREEZER - MOMENTS LATER 102 *
Adama rushes in to find the other Cylon down and Coker helping *
Beka up. Coker reflexively aims his rifle at Adama, then *
relaxes. *
COKER *
She’s okay, but this one almost nailed *
her before I got here. *
ADAMA *
There’s still two more... *
(checking his shotgun) *
And I’m almost out of rounds. *
COKER *
(checks his mag) *
Same here. *
Then he notes that the Cylon he shot isn’t quite dead. It’s *
writhing slightly. *
COKER (cont’d) *
But I can spare one for this sucker. *
(raising his rifle) *
Doesn’t seem to know it’s dead. *
He’s about to fire when Adama stops him. *
ADAMA
No! *
COKER
What the frak?!
ADAMA
I’ve got an idea. Help me drag it *
outside. *
Off Coker’s puzzled look... *
103 INT. SKI RESORT - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER 103 *
The not-quite-dead Cylon is lying on its back on a patch of *
snow, making faint noises as it writhes. REVEAL Adama, Coker *
and Beka in cover as they observe it. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 83.
101 CONTINUED: 101
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA *
Shouldn’t be long now. *
BEKA *
(horrified)
I know what you’re doing. Please,
don’t.
But Adama ignores her, and in a moment his hunch pays off. *
The two remaining Cylons dart out in the open as they move to *
retrieve their injured comrade. *
ADAMA
Take the one on the left... on my
mark... Now!
Adama and Coker fire two bursts, smoking the two Cylons. The *
battle’s over. Relieved, they approach the injured Cylon, which
is trying to inch toward its comrades while emitting a highpitched
electronic SQUEAL, somewhere between a human sound and a
MODEM. They train their guns on it. But they don’t shoot just *
yet, both curious --
ADAMA (cont’d)
What’s that sound it’s making?
BEKA
A distressed carrier wave.
COKER
A what?
BEKA
It’s screaming.
(as the men trade looks) *
Don’t either of you understand? They’re *
sentient. That’s why they try to rescue
each other... why they rebelled in the
first place. They just want to live
their own lives, the same as us.
COKER
(sarcastic)
Yeah, right.
BEKA
It’s not a threat anymore! We can leave
it alone.
COKER
(”no way”)
If more of its friends come by, it could
tell ‘em about us.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 84.
103 CONTINUED: 103
(CONTINUED)
Now the robot raises its remaining hand toward them, as if
pleading with them not to shoot. The high-pitched sound grows
more intense. Adama raises his shotgun. *
BEKA
NOOO!!!
The BLAST kills the Cylon. Machine oil starts to leak out, *
staining the snow. Beka looks ashen. Adama reaches for her. *
ADAMA
We didn’t have a --
But she flinches away. As we pull up and away... *
104 INT. SKI RESORT - ATRIUM - A SHORT TIME LATER 104 *
Coker rejoins Adama and Beka, who have been conferring. *
ADAMA *
(to Coker) *
Toth? *
COKER *
Tough bastard took out two more of those *
snake things but he ain’t gonna make it. *
(shows a handheld wireless) *
Took his wireless off him. *
ADAMA *
Why? *
COKER *
Whydaya think? Fun and games are over. *
I’m gonna send the evac code, and we’re *
gonna get the frak outta here. *
ADAMA
We can’t. Not until we complete the *
mission.
COKER
The “mission?” Are you outta your
frakkin’ mind?!
ADAMA
We get her where she needs to go, then *
we send the code. *
COKER
HEY! Case you didn’t notice, we’re
fresh out of Marines, and ammo, and we *
are not trained for this kinda shit!

Where are we going?
He turns back at the SOUND of a pistol being cocked to see *
Coker aiming his SIDEARM at him.
COKER
Drop the frakkin’ weapon, Husker.
ADAMA *
Coker...? What are you doing?
COKER
You two wanna die heroes, I can make
that happen right now. And trust me, I

Coker holding his sidearm on Adama, as before.
COKER
I said, drop it!
ADAMA
Can’t do that.
He slowly brings up the Cylon weapon. Mexican stand-off.
COKER
I will frakking kill you!
ADAMA
Then you better do it with your first *
shot.
BEKA
Stop it!
(to Coker)
You kill him, you’re still not getting
out of here. None of us are till my
mission’s complete.
COKER
Bullshit!
BEKA *
(indicates the wireless) *
You want to call for an extraction? Go *
ahead and try. No one’s gonna answer... *
not till I’ve reached my objective, an
automated Cylon transmission array about
six klicks from here, and uploaded a
virus designed to blind their defenses.
(holds out her “dogtag”)
A virus I’ve been in carrying in this.
Coker glares, then tosses the radio aside.
COKER
In other words, we never had a choice.
We either make it to the end, or get
left for dead on the road. Real nice.
BEKA
Don’t you get it? We don’t make it to
the end, we’re all dead anyway.

COKER
What’re you talking about?
BEKA
This war isn't going nearly as well as
the CDF is making out.
COKER
No shit, really?
BEKA
(ignoring the sarcasm)
This surprise attack is a last roll of
the dice. It fails, we fail. We lose.
And if I don’t upload this virus, it
will fail.
ADAMA
And you didn’t trust us enough to tell
us this before?
BEKA
No, and I wouldn’t now but I have no
choice.
Coker lowers his rifle, disgusted.
COKER
Finally. Something that almost sounds
like the truth.
(to Beka)
Tell us the rest and make sure there’s
no more surprises.
BEKA
Fine.
106 EXT. MOON - DAY 106 *
Adama, Coker and Beka make their way along a ridgeline. Adama *
and Coker carry CYLON RIFLES. All three wear SIDEARMS.
BEKA (V.O.)
Like I said, the array’s about six
klicks from here. If we start now,
we’ll get there just before nightfall.
107 EXT. MOON - RIDGE - SUNSET 107 *
Adama, Coker and Beka look down from the ridge on the Cylon *
facility dug into the snow-covered valley below. *

105 CONTINUED: 105

BEKA (V.O.)
The facility is automated, so we
hopefully we shouldn’t have to worry
about running into too many Centurion
guards. That is...
108 EXT. CYLON FACILITY - NIGHT 108
A TANGLE OF FIBER OPTIC WIRES is exposed, blinking ALLIGATOR
CLIPS attached to several. REVEAL BEKA using her HANDHELD to *
input alarm bypass codes.
BEKA (V.O.)
...as long as we’re careful not to trip
any of the alarm systems and trigger the
internal defenses. Which we will be.
She inputs a final code, and a “back door” slides open.
109 INT. CYLON FACILITY - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 109
Our people make their way down a narrow corridor, lit by *
pulsing red LEDS reminiscent of our BASE SHIP interiors but *
packed with exposed conduits, wiring and machinery. *
ADAMA
You say this array connects to their
primary com network?
BEKA
Not directly. The virus itself is
artificially intelligent. Once it gains
access to their main communication
channels it will spread through the
entire system, including all their
ships.
COKER
I still don’t get why there are no
guards.
BEKA
The patrol we fought at the hotel was
probably assigned here, but was pulled
away to deal with us.
COKER
Lucky us.
Adama thinks he sees a shadow near the junction of their
corridor with another. Raising his rifle, he cautiously
approaches the corner, then darts around it -- only to find
the other corridor empty.
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 89.
107 CONTINUED: 107
(CONTINUED)
COKER (cont’d)
What is it?
ADAMA
Thought I saw something. Guess I’m just
jumpy.
BEKA
The control room is this way.
She leads the way. Coker mutters to Adama as they follow.
COKER
I don’t like it. It’s too easy.
ADAMA
Figured you’d be happy no one’s shooting
at us.
COKER
You mean, no one’s shooting at us yet.
110 INT. CYLON FACILITY - CORRIDOR/CONTROL ROOM 110
As Adama and Beka wait outside the door, Coker darts inside,
the red laser from his Cylon rifle playing over banks of
machinery and terminals.
COKER
Clear.
Adama stays just inside the door, keeping an eye on the
corridor, while Beka quickly takes out her slate, hot-wires it
to one of the terminals, and starts entering commands. After
a beat, more terminals come on-line.
BEKA
We’re in.
(takes off her “dogtag”)
The program’s pretty large, it’ll take
about a minute to upload.
She places the dogtag in a nook, where a RED BEAM beam plays
over it, like the passport scanners at airports.
Her SLATE shows a PROGRESS BAR for the upload. But meanwhile
something about that scanning beam draws Coker’s attention.
He looks from it to the laser targeting beam on his rifle, and
he flashes back to --

THE FIREFIGHT AT THE HOTEL... THE CENTURION DRAWING A BEAD ON
BEKA... THE LASER TARGETING BEAM REFRACTING OFF THE SAME *
DOGTAG AROUND HER NECK... THE CENTURION HESITATING. *
BACK TO COKER as a puzzle starts to comes together...
ADAMA is checking the corridor, still wondering if he’s seeing
shadows lurking at the end of it, when --
COKER (O.S.)
That’s it, lady! Stop whatever the frak
it is you’re doing and step away from
that terminal!
Adama turns to see Coker with his rifle leveled at Beka, who
seems stunned and confused, as is Adama.
ADAMA
Coker? What the hell --?
COKER
-- She’s a symp spy! The frakking bitch
is working for them!
ADAMA *
A spy? How could she be a spy? I mean *
we were almost been killed by the Cylons *
how many times now? It doesn’t make *
sense. *
COKER *
The hotel. She knows. Ask her! *
BEKA *
I don’t know what he’s talking about, *
and we don’t have time for -- *
COKER *
-- that Toaster had you dead to rights! *
(brandishes the dogtag) *
Then it saw this thing and froze. You *
wanna explain that to me? *
Beka looks to Adama with an expression of helplessness. *
ADAMA *
It “froze?” *
COKER *
It didn’t shoot. It ID’d her. *
Adama steps between Coker and Beka. *
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 91.
110 CONTINUED: 110
(CONTINUED)
ADAMA *
C’mon, buddy, just take it easy. We’re *
all on the same side here. *
And Coker’s gun swings to point at Adama. *
COKER *
Are we? Occurs to me you stepped into *
the picture ‘bout the same time as her. *
And guess who’s been defending her, *
pushing this mission all along? Maybe *
you’re in on it, too! *
Beka glances at her slate. The progress bar is half complete. *
ADAMA *
That’s crazy. I mean you gotta know how *
crazy that sounds. *
COKER *
How crazy is it that we got in here this *
easy? *
ADAMA *
Easy? Easy -- ? *
COKER *
How come we’re still alive and everyone *
else -- everyone -- is dead? And don’t *
tell me it’s luck ‘cause I ain’t buying! *
Now get out of my way! *
ADAMA *
Coker, I just -- *
A shot rings out, only it’s not from Coker’s gun, which now *
clatters to the floor. Coker eyes Adama sourly... *
COKER *
Dumb frakking Husker. *
...before slumping to the floor as we reveal Beka with her *
sidearm now trained on Adama, while she works a Cylon terminal *
with her free hand. *
ADAMA *
Beka...? *
BEKA *
Put the rifle down, William. *
(when he hesitates) *
Please. You’re a sweet boy but I will *
shoot you if I have to. *

ACT TEN
111 INT. CYLON FACILITY - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 111 *
Adama drops the gun, then reacts as the Cylon screens start *
flashing with images, graphics and data relating to the Ghost
Fleet. Ships, manpower, coordinates, battle plans. *
ADAMA
Coker was right. That chip, it’s not a
virus, it’s a recording device. You’re
sending them all the data on the ghost
fleet.
Beka just keeps the gun on him as she continues working. *
ADAMA (cont’d)
That’s why they destroyed the
Archeron... so Colonial Intel would be
forced to send us on to the fleet
itself.
BEKA
The Cylons’ own intel told them it
existed but they didn’t know where to
find it.
ADAMA
And it explains why you wanted us along
for the ride. Because we were dumb
enough not to see that they were letting
us survive.
(eyeing Coker)
At least I was.
BEKA
Don't sell yourself short. It's not
like they were all in on it. The fact
is, if you weren't so good at what you
do we'd never have made it this far.
ADAMA
So why? I thought you wanted to end
this war.
BEKA
I do. But it won’t end until we realize
we can’t win... ...that we don’t deserve
to win so we can go on subjugating
another life form.
ADAMA
They’re robots! Soul-less frakking
robots!
"Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10 93.
(CONTINUED)
BEKA
No, we're the ones who’ve lost our
souls! We're liars and hypocrites, and
this war is based on the biggest lie of
all: that we can create life and then
pretend it's something else, something
less than what we are. The Cylons don’t
want to destroy us, they just want to be
left alone to live their lives.
ADAMA
Yeah? Try telling that to the people on
Gemenon, or Aquarion... or the people I
saw dead on the streets of Caprica City.
BEKA
And how many of them have we destroyed?
ADAMA
They attacked us!
BEKA
After years of being treated as slaves.
But of course you can’t see that, not
after being raised on a diet of
jingoist, “killer robot” drivel. That’s
why we've got to get knocked to our
knees and dragged to the negotiating
table.
Adama looks like he's had the wind knocked out of him, but now
he notices something out of the corner of his eye: Coker's
hand creeping toward his sidearm. Adama starts to slowly step
aside, letting Beka’s pistol follow him.
ADAMA
You really think they'll negotiate when
they've spent the last ten years trying
to wipe us out?
BEKA
They’re just defending themselves.
ADAMA
Bullshit!
But now Beka sees Coker raising his gun. She aims hers.
ADAMA (cont’d)
NO!
He rushes her. She quickly shoots him, the bullet slamming
into his shoulder. But not before Coker also gets off a shot.
Beka falls, and Coker lets his gun drop to his side.

Adama, wounded but not as badly as his friend, kicks the gun
out of her hand, then moves to Coker's side.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Coker? Coker?!
Coker nods weakly to the computers.
COKER
Just stop it. Stop the upload.
Adama crosses to the terminal, unsure how to work it, then
sees the status bar on Beka’s slate: “Upload complete.”
ADAMA
Too late. But maybe not too late to
warn the fleet about this frak-up, then
get you outta here...
He works the touchscreen, inputting a coded message. *
ADAMA (cont’d)
We can still make this work for us.
They’ll come gunning for the fleet with
everything they got. But if we know
they’re coming...
(the console freezes up)
Shit! It locked me out. Can’t tell if
I got through or not.
COKER
Then stop wasting your time and get
yourself outta here!
ADAMA
What makes you think I’m gonna start to
listening to you now?
Glancing down, he notices that Beka’s still alive, looking up
at him with pleading eyes. He ignores her, helping the badly
injured Coker to his feet.
ADAMA (cont’d)
C’mon, old man, time to go home.
As they leave Beka behind...
112 EXT. MOON - DAY 112 *
Adama and Coker make their way with difficulty. Coker’s in *
bad shape, but not so bad that he can’t see Adama is
struggling as he half carries him, blood from his own shoulder *
wound seeping through an improvised bandage.

COKER
This is far enough. Put me down. I

ADAMA
Fine. Didn’t want to drag your sorry
ass any farther anyway.
He sets Coker down with his back against a tree, then turns on
a small electronic BEACON and jams it into the ground.
ADAMA (cont’d)
There. Shouldn’t be long if they’ve got
a SAR bird waiting nearby.
COKER
Yeah, well while we’re waiting...
He digs into a breast pocket, pulls out a slightly bloodied *
snapshot of a pretty young woman.
COKER (cont’d)
...hold onto this for me, okay?
ADAMA
Who’s that?
COKER
Katie. My wife.
(as Adama reacts)
She’s gonna be so pissed. I quit
answering her letters -- now this. Want
you to look her up if you ever make it
to Aerilon.
ADAMA
Of course. Why didn’t you tell me? And
why didn’t you write her back?
COKER
Not sure that’s easy to explain.
He coughs. Adama checks the dressing on his chest wound.
ADAMA
Then don’t. Just save your breath,
okay?
COKER
Nah. Kinda wanna understand it myself.
(beat)
You start out, you’re too young and
green to really think you’re gonna buy
it. That bullet with your name on it?

It’s got another guy’s name instead.
The guy in the seat next to you. The
guys in the other plane. But they start
adding up, those guys, till it seems
like everyone you started out with is
gone. And then you know: your turn is
coming.
(coughs)
So maybe you just stop. Stop thinking.
Stop hoping. And if you got something
waiting for you back home, stop thinkin’
about that too. Easier not to sweat the
future if you think you don’t have one.
ADAMA
You do now. You made it. You’re going
home.
COKER
Home.
ADAMA
That’s right.
(stuffs the photo back in
Coker’s breast pocket)
So you keep this, and you try explaining
to your wife yourself why you’re such an
asshole. See if she’ll take your sorry
ass back.
COKER
That’ll be the day.
His chuckle turns into a cough. His hand fumbles at another
pocket. Adama sees what he’s after and pulls out the flask.
ADAMA
Looking for this?
He unscrews the cap, gives him a drink.
COKER
You got lousy taste in women, but you’re
all right, Husker.
ADAMA
Thanks, I guess.
(then)
Coker? Coker?
And as we push in on the stricken face of the young William
Adama, engines start to roar overhead and search lights play
down, as at the top of the show.

A MEDIC grabs the object, a BASKET STRETCHER, and guides it to
the ground, where we see Adama lying beside Coker, weak from
his own wound.
ADAMA turns his head to see a SECOND MEDIC check Coker, then
shake his head gravely to the other medic. Adama closes his
eyes.
114 INT. CYLON FACILITY 114
Beka lies on her back, breathing shallowly. A SHADOW falls
over her, and then a DELICATE MACHINE HAND brushes her cheek.
CYLON (O.S.)
Are you alive?
It’s a female voice, with only the slightest machine edge.
Beka looks up to see a Cylon unlike any we’ve seen crouching
over her. Clearly female, even sleekly beautiful, poised
halfway between machine and human.
Beka finds herself reaching up to it for comfort, touching the
Cylon's smooth face, and we sense the echo of the earlier
scene where the wounded Cylon reached toward Adama. This
time, the machine's eyes -- and it indeed has two eyes, also
quite human-looking -- look back at her almost sorrowfully.
CYLON (cont’d)
(gently)
Do you think because you're more
enlightened than the rest of your
species, we hate you any less?
And as Beka’s own eyes widen in surprise, the Cylon reaches
out of frame, toward her neck, and we hear a dry SNAP. As the
machine continues to consider the dead woman with a hint of
sorrow mixed with something else, we PRELAP PATRIOTIC MUSIC.
115 EXT. SPACE - NEWSREEL 115
The Colonial Defense Forces LOGO wheels at us again, then
retreats to a corner of the screen as we watch what looks like
documentary footage of The Valkyrie and the “Ghost Fleet”

Adama lies in a bed, recovering, while other wounded flyers

But we still need your help. So give
your all for the war. Buy war bonds and
sign up for service today!
Disgusted, Adama uses a REMOTE to turn the TV off. Commander *
Nash enters. *
NASH *
Ah there’s our young hero. How you
feeling today, Ensign?
ADAMA
Ready to get out of this bed, sir. *
ADMIRAL
That’s the spirit, but we’ll let the doc *
decide that. Meanwhile... *
(shows Adama a DOCUMENT) *
Wanted you to review your after-action *
report. Command made a few changes they *
need you to sign off on.
Adama scans the pages, then reacts with surprise.
ADAMA
Sir, this isn’t what happened.
ADMIRAL
Well, a lot happened on this mission,
didn’t it? Guess they reviewed the *

ADMIRAL
Yeah, well, you also warned us in time
to abort the attack.
ADAMA
But this report says the mission was a
complete success. That’s... that’s just
a lie.
Nash’s smile get a little tighter. *
ADMIRAL
Well, an overstatement perhaps. But a
lie?
(beat)
Son, there’s a bit more at stake here
than your personal sense of integrity.
The public supports the war with their
money, and they’ll stop if we stop
giving them hope. So let the people
have their heroes and their victories,
while we fight the real war.
He pushes the papers across the tray table. A soul-searching *
beat, then Adama signs. Nash nods approvingly. *
ADMIRAL (cont’d)
I knew you were part of the team.
Speaking of which, we’re assembling a
new joint task force. Our best pilots,
Marines and infantry units for special
operations throughout the war theater.
Figured you might want to volunteer, so
I made sure there's a shiny new Viper *
with your name on it waiting for you. *
Well, maybe not with your name on it
just yet -- I hear you still have to *
pick a call sign.
Adama's expression betrays his conflicted emotions. This is
everything he wanted, but not the price he expected to pay.
The Admiral can read him and puts a hand on his shoulder.

You look like shit by the way.
ADAMA
You look in a mirror yourself lately?
Still, his eyes beseech answers.
COKER
They said it was touch and go but
apparently I was too frakking stubborn
to die. Kept me isolated while they
debriefed me. Guess they wanted to make
sure I wasn’t mixed up in Kelly’s scam.
Adama is smiling. He starts to chuckle, then laugh.
COKER (cont’d)
What?
(re: his hospital gown)
It’s this damn thing, isn’t it? I
swear, they can jump a ship ten leagues,

Adama, wearing his flight suit, sits at a chair, briefing book
open on his lap, writing a letter.
ADAMA (V.O.)
Got your last letter. You're right
about preconceptions being dangerous,
and not just in court. This war is
turning out to be different than I
expected. But maybe my mistake was to
have expectations.
He reacts to gleeful shouts of a group of newly minted pilots
crowded around someone's handheld screen, from which the
unmistakable sounds of another “war porn” video can be heard.
Now it’s Adama who sighs, then turns back to his writing.
ADAMA (V.O.)
It’s something you have to live inside
of to understand, and while a part of me *
already hates it, another part knows

When it’s over, and some day it will be

battles but the men and women who fought

MEMORIES of some of those men and women now flash through his

ROOKIE PILOT
Mister Adama! Just wanted to say I

He sticks out a hand. Adama looks past the outstretched hand
and meets the eyes of Tornvald, who’s about to get into his
plane. A silent understanding passes between the two men. *
Adama turns back to the rookie. *
ADAMA *
I’ll let you in on a secret, kid. *
We can guess what he’s about to say, but then he hesitates, *
some part of him not ready to succumb to cynicism just yet. *
ADAMA (cont’d) *
Just keep your head down, okay? *
The rookie nods, then Adama climbs into his shiny new Viper, *
tail number N7242C. *
He finds a NOTE taped to his instruments panel. “Drinks
later, hotshot?” It’s signed “J.”
Adama looks across the deck and sees Jaycie smiling at him as
she gets in her Raptor. He gives her a smile and a nod, then
closes his canopy. The Viper is towed out of frame.

TIGH BOUNDING down A CORRIDOR. He’s gnarly, intense, focused

handful of amped up marines led by MATHIAS rapidly falls in
step behind them. Tigh growls over his shoulder.
TIGH
Look alive. And for frak’s sake,

Helo turns to Tigh as they hustle on.
HELO

3 INT. HANGAR DECK - LEE 3
sitting in the cockpit of Kara’s pristine Viper, cordoned off
and hunkered in a darkened corner of THE HANGAR DECK. He
clutches the FLIGHT STICK that Kara used to shoot herself
into legend, feels her grip, takes in her scent. Catches
sight of something. A PIECE OF CHEWING GUM, stuck under the
instrument panel for safe-keeping. Lee chuckles. Then SIGHS.
And sighs again, which evolves into LABORED BREATHING...
4 INT. ADAMA’S QUARTERS - KARA THRACE 4
The source of the labored breathing. She stands, skin livid,
eyes fixed on someone, as she swipes a wrist under her nose
to mop away the sweat. Kara catches her breath, then
gestures with A PISTOL dangling in her hand, at her side.
WIDEN TO REVEAL LAURA ROSLIN, slowly rising from Adama’s
couch, the wash cloth in her hand. Resigned but unbowed, she
swoons a little (from chemo side-effects received in ep. 3),
but won’t give Kara the satisfaction of seeing her weakened.
Laura glances at the side arm clutched in Kara’s hand.
KARA
I want to hate you so much.

So much.
Laura answers with a pained half-grin.
5 INT. CORRIDOR - TIGH, HELO, AND THE MARINES 5

6 INT. ADAMA’S QUARTERS - RESUME 6
Kara, aggressive, her head dipping forward, as if to duck
into Laura’s space, her gaze searing into the president.
KARA
You had a vision, remember? The
arrow? The temple? I went down
with you on that planet, it was a
frakking toaster party, good people
died, remember?
LAURA
Yes --
KARA
-- I trusted you! On a vision. And
that’s all. A vision. I saw Earth.
I saw it with my eyes! And I hear
it calling me back, DAMN IT, WE’RE

KARA (cont’d)
Why? Why can’t you trust me?
Laura regards Kara for a moment. Then...
LAURA
The sweetest, kindest young woman
on Galactica put two bullets in
William Adama’s chest.
KARA
And what? Because I came back and
the news was too good I’m a Cylon?
LAURA
We all saw you die... Kara. We saw
it on Lee’s gun cameras --
Kara THRUSTS the gun, butt forward at Laura, who
involuntarily flinches. Kara gestures for Laura to take it.
KARA
Shoot me.
Laura, pale, nauseous, stares Kara down.
KARA (cont’d)
Come on. Shoot me. Shoot your enemy.
See, back on the ole base ship, we
take this stuff seriously, you frak
with another skinjob’s number, you
better be ready to back it up.
Laura swoons again, but she fights it, looks away.
LAURA
I won’t be a part of this --
BOOM! Kara SLAMS the gun down on the desk in front of Laura.
KARA
Take it.
Pissed off, Laura disdainfully drops the washcloth aside.
7 INT. HANGAR DECK 7
Lee walking away from the Viper. Notices a smudge on his nice
civilian clothes, swipes at it, when TYROL trots up.

Adama’s jaw clenches. Looks to Gaeta as he hurries out.

still on the table.
LAURA
Heart racing, her contempt for being forced into such a
situation rising in her throat, glowers at Kara.
KARA
I’m no more of a Skinjob than you
are and you know it.
LAURA
I wish I did --
KARA
(ON her dialogue)
-- I put my life on the line for
this frakking ship! I ate and slept
and fought next to the people I
loved. I pissed off my friends, I
broke more rules than I followed, I
frakked up, I made a mess of things
but this is all I have! This is my
family and none of us belong here!
Kara’s declaration seems to move Laura; her expression
manifests some revelatory germ in her brain rapidly
multiplying into a profound realization.
LAURA
Starbuck...

This is you. You’re more human

Kara exhales from the bottom of her feet, relieved.
KARA
Gods... Welcome to my nightmare...
LAURA
They made you perfect, didn’t they?
And in one fluid motion, Laura SWEEPS the gun from the table
POINTS it at Kara and --
10A INT. CORRIDOR 10A
POW! The virulent pop of A GUNSHOT shocks Tigh, Helo, and the
marines just as they approach Adama’s quarters.
10B INT. ADAMA’S QUARTERS 10B
INSTANTANEOUS: TIGH bounds in, sees Laura holding the gun,
Kara, gawking at the SHATTERED PICTURE of Laura and Adama,
just to the left of her head, the Marines are all over her,
hollering like banshees, CHAOS erupting.
MATHIAS
DOWN ON THE FLOOR! DOWN ON THE
FLOOR! NOW! NOW! NOW!
Helo, shaken, watches the marines gang-tackle Kara, who kicks
and thrashes like a swamp gator.
TIGH
Madam President...?
KARA
Frakking bag of smashed
assfaces! Get off me! *
As Tigh comes to Laura, she nods that she’s unharmed but she
looks shell-shocked. They both stare at the gun in her hand,
both silently aware of what she just tried to do. Laura
absently hands the weapon to Tigh.
Adama strides in, Kara raging at the marines.
KARA (O.S.)
I’m losing it! I’m losing the
frakking sounds! Admiral! ADMIRAL!

What the frak happened? I thought

TIGH
We were! She’s out of her frakking
mind!
KARA (O.S.)
Mathias, you dried up stump, it’s
me! I’m not a frakking Cylon!
Kara BITES Mathias in the leg and she hollers in pain.
ADAMA
(to Laura, softly)
How you doing?
But before Laura can answer, the marines have Kara,
handcuffed and on her feet now. She commands Adama’s
attention -- and everyone else in the room. Kara grins
sardonically at Tigh as the marines drag her to her feet.
KARA
Hello, Colonel. Wanna watch them
shave my head before they airlock
me?
Tigh, the closet Final Fiver, buffers his comeback just a
hint from Tigh, the hard ass Cylon fighter.
TIGH
I oughta do it myself.
Kara looks to Adama, makes a final, sober plea.
KARA
Listen to me. Please. The ringing,
the way to Earth, I’m losing it,
it’s getting weaker, don’t you
understand? Don’t any of you?
Tigh does. He heard the music. And after witnessing what
Laura just did and hearing what’s coming out of Kara’s mouth
he might be the most furtively agitated in the room if it
weren’t for Helo, deeply troubled, staring at Kara.
KARA (cont’d)
It was clear, I could hear it like
it was coming from the other room,
DON’T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT!

I can feel it slipping away, even

we’ll never find it again! I
thought that’s what we wanted. A
way to Earth. Did you hear me?
TIGH
Get her out of here.
Helo winces as Kara bucks and resists, getting one last
diatribe in at Laura.
KARA
You better work on your aim.
Because I’m not gonna stop! You’re
gonna have to kill me!
(then, to Adama)
One Jump and it’s gone. GONE.
As the marines hustle Kara out, Adama and Laura’s eyes meet.
Uncertainty, self-consciousness, and grave concern arc
between them like an electrical storm, as we...

FADE IN:
11 INT. CYLON BASE SHIP - CAVIL’S QUARTERS 11
SCHEMATICS, hi-tech visuals of RAIDER design plans,
circuitry, brain scans on screens behind CAVIL, at a desk.
Eased back in his chair, chin cradled in his locked hands,
eyes squinting, Cavil seriously contemplates on
A NUDE BOOMER
Doing a graceful series of balletic stretching exercises in
front of his desk.
NATALIE (O.S.)
Cavil.
WIDEN to NATALIE/SIX, A SHARON and a LEOBEN, standing in
Cavil’s entrance arch (the base ship rooms have no doors).
CAVIL
What?
NATALIE
We have something to discuss.
CAVIL
(weary)
You know, even I need to knock off
once in a while, it can’t wait?
LEOBEN
No. It can’t.
Cavil reluctantly dispatches Boomer.
CAVIL
I’m sorry, sweetheart, try and
remember where you were and we’ll
pick up on this another time.
(glaring at Leoben)
Soon. So?
As Boomer exits, the trio steps forward.
NATALIE
You heard what The Hybrid said.
'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/07 8.
(CONTINUED)
CAVIL
You mean that incomprehensible
blather about The Raiders “refusing
to fire on their own.” Don’t remind
me.
NATALIE
We’ve given it a great deal of
thought. The Hybrid is clearly
telling us something.
CAVIL
The Hybrid is always telling us
something. They’re supposed to
maintain the operation of each
ship, not vomit metaphysics.
(OFF their looks)
All right, I give up. What? What
is she trying to say?
SHARON
They’re in the Colonial Fleet.
With the humans.
Cavil makes a lavishly confused face.
CAVIL
“They.” They-who?
Leoben conspiratorially glances at Natalie and Sharon. Then:
LEOBEN
The Final Five.
The trio’s eyes dart from each other to Cavil, as they wait
for his response. STUNNED, his bell profoundly rung, Cavil
slowly rises to his feet.
NATALIE
The Raiders refuse to fight because
they sense the Final Five could be
in the Human Fleet.
LEOBEN
They could’ve been captured, they
could be in hiding --
Cavil vehemently shakes his head.
CAVIL
No, stop, right now. Turn around,
go for a cleansing walk and I’ll
try and forget what I just heard --

NATALIE
The Final Five, Cavil, they’re
near, this is far too important for
us --
LEOBEN
(revelling)
My God, what their eyes must’ve
seen, and witnessed over time.
SHARON
Do you think they look anything
like us?
CAVIL
That’s enough --
LEOBEN
Oh, they must be beautiful --
(*Note to editing. Possible brief insert of TIGH, from scene
12, then back to scene 11)
CAVIL
ENOUGH!
That got everyone’s attention.
CAVIL (cont’d)
Listen to yourselves. Do you
realize what you’re doing? You’re
openly discussing The Final Five,
which is forbidden by...
But he trails off because the looks he gets from Natalie and
Leoben tells him they know exactly what they’re doing. His
discerning brows threaten, his nose flares. Nods to himself.

When did this start?
LEOBEN

CAVIL
(ignoring him)
It has to be some kind of massive
systems failure. I’m worried.
NATALIE
No, it’s wonderful, we’ve
transcended our programing code --
CAVIL
-- you’re toying with your
survival! Look at yourselves!
Look! Millions of Twos have that
nose, Millions of Sixes possess
that mouth, Eights share those
breasts,
(tapping his head)
Ones have this intellect! We’re
mechanized copies! And there’s a
reason why the original programmers
clearly felt it was a mistake for
us to know The Final Five!
NATALIE
No --
CAVIL
Violating that programming could
threaten our survival.
NATALIE
Something’s changed --
CAVIL
-- They changed. The Raiders.
That’s where this all started --
with them. They’ve somehow exceeded
their programming and unlike us,
they can’t correct themselves. So.
Unfortunately. We’ll have to do it.
NATALIE
What?
CAVIL
Reconfigure their neural
architecture. Shave down their
heuristic response.
LEOBEN
Lobotomize them? Dumb them down?

CAVIL
(rolling his eyes)
Oh, God... “Here, Spike.” They’re
tools, not pets. Look, the last
thing I want is to be laminated in
Raider blood. It’s a messy, timeconsuming
procedure but it has to
be done.
NATALIE
Says who?
CAVIL
(irritated)
The God Almighty Voice of Reason.
Let me know when you hear it.
Cavil tries to walk past Six, but she holds him back.
NATALIE
You don’t have the authority to
make any change without a majority
vote.
CAVIL
So we’ll vote. But the Fours and
Fives will go my way --
NATALIE
-- There will be a vote. The
Raiders hear what we hear --
CAVIL
The Raiders are simple machines --
NATALIE
-- No. Something extraordinary has
happened, something’s calling to
us, pushing us to discover our
origins, to understand our place in
the universe. The Raiders are a
part of it. And The Final Five --
CAVIL
-- are anywhere but with the
humans.

TIGH
You’re late.
TYROL
I had to wait for Cally to nod off,

ANDERS
Did you see Kara?
TIGH
I saw her. Crazy as a latrine rat.
If anything, she’s more like
Starbuck than ever.
ANDERS
(rising to pace)
Then we gotta do something --
TIGH
-- Siddown! SIDDOWN! We don’t get
involved, you keep your pretty boy
nose out of it!
TORY
She is his wife --
TIGH
-- and The President nearly put a
bullet in her skull because she
suspected her of being a Cylon.
(to Anders)
You are one. We bring attention to
ourselves, we’re frakked. If
Starbuck’s one of us, she’s selling
it big the other way.
TORY
True. Four of us heard the music,
we sought each other out. She
hasn’t. We’re still missing one.
Anders broods, head down now. Won’t look at the others.
TYROL
Baltar. On The Algae Planet, when
I found him, he was with the
skinjob, the one they called
D’Anna. She saw something. They
talked, he could know something.

TIGH
Baltar. “Not Guilty.” My ears are

TYROL
Now he’s got a following. These OneGod

kid. Woke him up from a coma.
TIGH
Maybe he knows who the fifth is.
TORY
Maybe he knows who we are.
TIGH
So we need to get in close and find
out what’s slithering around under
that frakking scalp.
TYROL
How? Be his drinking buddy? He’s
gonna suspect us.
Tigh leans back in his chair. Then...
TIGH
Well, he’s accomplished at two
things. Lying in a cell or in a
woman. He’d even poke a skinjob, he
racked up the Six, that’s a given.

You don’t have to get on your back

Gee, thanks.
Anders finally looks up at Tigh. Speaks.

thinking? Well, answer me!
KARA
I’m not a Cylon --
ADAMA

you didn’t just terrorize The President,
you went after a sick woman --

She wouldn’t believe me --
ADAMA
She’s dying of cancer!
KARA
I was --
CUTTING HER OFF, he shakes her by the shoulders.
ADAMA

Because I had it up to here with
being poked and eyeballed and

ADAMA
Clarity. All this makes sense to
you? Turning my ship upside down,
knocking a handful of marines into
sickbay, stalking the president --
KARA

Has anyone? I saw it. I saw Earth,
the shape of it, the smell, the
feeling of it on my skin, in my
pores, and I swear to you, it was
like I’d been there before, like I’d
never left, I’m telling you, I was
looking at the answer to everything.
And you’re gonna take that away --
ADAMA
-- You gave me no choice!
KARA
Listen to me. It’s in here.
(she pats her temple)
Right here. It’s playing in my
frakking skull, this beautiful sound,
as if the thought of a God leaked out
in space and when it’s gone, it’ll be
too late. There’s not enough time, I
had to do something --
ADAMA
-- No. No. You had do it your way,
you wouldn’t let me handle it. You
didn’t have the guts to hang on.
And that’s all. When did I lose
your trust Starbuck?
(OFF her look)
That’s right. I know who you are.
You’re just too stupid to figure
out you screwed over the one ally
you had. Now who’s gonna help you?
Kara stares hard, winces, the epiphany stabbing like a knife
in her temple. But she cauterizes her regret, goes to the
place she knows best: a little more driven than smart, a
little braver than either.
KARA
Yeah. Frak me. It isn’t gonna be

Nice to know you still care.
She smiles, her mouth slightly open, still smiling as a

gestures to Simon and Doral...
CAVIL
The Fours and Fives voted as we
Ones did -- for reconfiguring the
Raiders.
NATALIE
Gee, what a surprise. The Twos,
Sixes and Eights voted against it.
So we’re deadlocked.
CAVIL
Hopelessly. But you were right.
And I’m machine enough to admit
that I was wrong.

This is wrong! She can’t!

You had something to do with this.
CAVIL
I don’t know the whys or the

decision.
NATALIE
You cannot allow this!
LEOBEN

There’s no law, no edict, there’s

butchering them!
CAVIL
We’re reconfiguring them --
NATALIE

CAVIL
No. I’m a mechanic. They were

I’m fixing it. And when all the
cutting’s done, they’ll be happy

Natalie faces Cavil, looks hard into those haughty eyes of
his for a moment, then leans in close to him and speaks

Narcho while Racetrack and Hot Dog play strip poker cutting
cards, Hotdog losing badly, down to his boxers, Racetrack in
a sports bra and combat pants. When Hotdog loses the next
cut, PILOTS yell “Pants him! Pants him!” Adama and Lee
laughing their fool asses off. Meanwhile Helo ceremoniously
pours SIX SHOTS of Ambrosia in front of Lee over the din,
spilling when a drunken elbow or two jostles him. He quickly
sneaks down one of the shots he poured, then re-fills it. And

alcohol with a HOWL, the CHEERS continuing. HELO looks over,
sees ATHENA, drinking, smiling back at him, but she’s pretty

as if he wants him to do the same. Lee leans in closer. He
cups his hand around the back of Lee’s neck.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Right here. Like a whisper in hard
shoes, up and down your spine, “Get
ready, Get ready...”
Adama is buzzed, troubled, drifts a little...
ADAMA (cont’d)
And... when it calls, you can’t
answer it... you’re gonna have to
remind yourself that... you’re
someone else now.
A beat. Then Adama reaches into his pocket. He hands KARA’S
FIGURE HEAD to Lee, who takes it.
LEE
What is it?
ADAMA
Something that means the world to
me that I’m no longer able to keep.
(then)
I want you to have it.
Appreciative, Lee regards the figure head, then...
LEE
Dad... I want to see Kara.
ADAMA
So do I... So do I...
STAY ON THE FIGURE HEAD as Lee’s palm closes over it.

20 INT. GALACTICA - CIVILIAN MESS HALL 20
Crowded. BALTAR, sitting alone at a table. Glances around,
leery of his surroundings, his first time in public since the
near-stabbing incident in Ep. 3. Feeling relatively safe,
the only remaining threat is the plate of algae mush in front
of him. He makes a face, mutters to it.
BALTAR
Neptune’s feast.
But suddenly a passer-by places a SLICE OF BREAD in front of
him. Another passer-by places AN APPLE next to him, then
another A BOWL OF NOODLES. It’s his flock, showing their
appreciation. Profoundly moved, Baltar’s eyes well up. Still,
through his watery peepers, he manages to take a BITE of the
apple, savoring it until he sees TORY, sitting alone, at
another table, looking around, trying to be inconspicuous.
She looks away. Baltar grunts in distaste, his mouth full.
TORY
picking at some algae polenta, when BALTAR plops down across
from Tory, STARTLING the hell out of her.
BALTAR (cont’d)
Tory, Tory, Tory. Imagine finding
you here.
TORY
Hello.
He’s brought his food with him. Takes a bite from his apple.
Gestures with it, juicy with sarcasm.
BALTAR
Can I ask you a question? Just
where, precisely did you learn the
art of espionage? From a book? A
children’s book?
TORY
What -- ?
BALTAR
Your spy skills -- Oh, please.
Spare me. You’d be less obvious in
a stealth suit with “spy” tatooed
on your forehead. You’re here to
spy on me.
TORY
No, I... heard about the miracle.

Excuse me, you mean Laura Roslin

TORY
All right, I have been watching. I

look at you. Something’s changed.
BALTAR
(mercilessly facetious)
Do you know that I haven’t been
threatened with a lethal weapon for
a whole day?
TORY
(ignoring his sarcasm)
You’ve become special to them.
BALTAR
Oh, very much so.
TORY
There’s something about you that
can’t be easily... dismissed.
BALTAR
Go squeal to The President that my
popularity borders on phenomenal
and she should be very worried.
TORY
I came here on my own.
BALTAR
And I slept with your boss last
night.
Tory lets the remark pass. Takes off her blazer.
HEAD BALTAR (O.S.)
Ah-ah -- be nice.
WIDEN TO REVEAL HEAD BALTAR, sitting next to Tory. Baltar
looks ABSOLUTELY SPOOKED by this apparition.

Maybe it was a mistake. But... I

happened. You were found innocent
when everyone hated you, I hated
you... this healed boy...the return
of Kara Thrace when everyone
thought she was dead.
(then)
Perhaps there are miracles.
Baltar’s eyes dart back and forth from Tory to Head Baltar.
HEAD BALTAR
Perhaps.
TORY
The thing is, somehow you seem to
be at the center of them.
The remark puts Baltar a little more at ease; flattery has
always been his Catnip. Head Baltar raises his eyebrows.
BALTAR
Yes...so it seems... I’m at a loss
as to why, but God did his work, he
chose to... awaken me. Not unlike
my intercession with the boy.
TORY
Awaken. How did it feel?
(off his stare)
Look, I just... need to know.
BALTAR
Well... previous to...
(gazing heavenward)
His disclosure, it was...
(struggling)
It was... It was as if...

Stoop a little, will you? You don’t

Trumpets and violins, calling your

Music. The word seems to entrance Tory. It is, verily,

HEAD BALTAR
Look at her, Gaius. This woman is
no spy. As hard as she’s fought not
to, she believes you. That? That
is the face of truth.
Aware of her surroundings once more -- after all, she really
isn’t there at Laura’s behest -- Tory rises to leave.
TORY
I really shouldn’t be seen here.
Do you think we can... talk again?
Baltar regards her for a moment.
BALTAR
All right.
(contemplatively covers
his mouth, then...)
Yes. Yes, that would be.. fine.
(offers the bitten apple)
Would you...?
She smiles, shakes her head, takes her blazer and exits. When
she’s gone, Baltar’s plastered smile immediately vanishes.
BALTAR (cont’d)
Who are you? Another angel? Six?
Is it you? In disguise?
HEAD BALTAR
Now why would she have to disguise
herself from you?
BALTAR
Well -- then where is she?

Yes, I sensed that, too. Fragile.

Fragile. Handle with care. And you
don’t need the feminine

By the unsavory look on Sharon’s face, this is eminently
true. Boomer stands there, mute. Forlorn. Finally, Natalie
comes to Boomer. Puts her arms around her and embraces her.
NATALIE
How can we judge? We’re all

Boomer kisses Natalie’s cheek, then exits. Sharon hisses.

Laura sits in a stuffed chair, abjectly bracing for the
miserable side effects of her latest chemo treatment to kick

shamble to his desk and re-fill his tumbler.
LAURA
You seem to be enjoying that more
than usual.
ADAMA
Hair of the dog. Lee’s party.
Laura snorts. Adama comes back, a hang-over crowded in his
skull, sits down. Sips. A BEAT, then...
LAURA
So. What do we do? Find Lampkin?
Put her on trial? Ask for a show
of hands?
ADAMA
...I don’t know.
LAURA

Adama sips from his drink. Swallows hard.
ADAMA
She’s... driven...
LAURA
Do you want to keep waltzing or ask
me to sit down and talk? What’s

Laura watches Adama squirm a little. He grudgingly NODS.
ADAMA
Look, I’m not a spiritual person.
But what if she’s speaking the

you'd like to call it? Say it.
C'mon, Bill, grab your piece of

Admiral Atheist say a miracle has
happened.
ADAMA
You shot at her and missed.
LAURA
Doloxan fraks with your aim.
ADAMA
So does doubt.
LAURA
I pulled the trigger. And I’d pull
it again. She wanted me to shoot
her, she dared me to shoot her, she
put her life in front of a bullet
as if it meant nothing. You break
an egg, you reach for another one.
ADAMA
Maybe convincing you meant more to
her than her own life.
LAURA
And that’s your miracle?
ADAMA
No, that’s not --
LAURA
-- You want to talk about miracles?
On the very day that a very pale
doctor informed me that I had
terminal cancer, most of humanity

your own demise than lose her --
ADAMA

You can stay in the room. But get

LAURA
You’re so afraid to live alone --
ADAMA
-- and you’re afraid to die that
way! You’re afraid you might not be
the dying leader after all, that
your death will be as meaningless

Horrified by what he just blurted out, Adama’s face swirls

pulls back, turns away and leaves her.
STAY ON LAURA, despairing, leaning back, surrendering to the

On your way out, tell ’em they’re

They exchange a silent look, then rush into each other’s
embrace and kiss -- a deep, and ungoverned kiss, the kind
that withers the weedy encroachment of life’s illusory
miseries. They kiss again and again, pecking each other’s
mouths and cheeks and chins and eyes with love, more powerful
than sensual. As they hold each other...
LEE
You’ll make them believe you.
KARA
I know.
They separate just enough to lean on each other’s foreheads.
Lee takes Kara’s hand now, places something in it.
LEE
Take this.

33 INT. CYLON BASE SHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM 33
NATALIE standing in front of a table where Cavil, two Simons,
and two Dorals are sharing some drink.
NATALIE
We want you to stop lobotomizing
The Raiders. Cavil.
CAVIL
(to the others)
They want us to stop reconfiguring
the Raiders.
Cavil regards her.
CAVIL (cont’d)
You know how much I hate that name,
“Cavil?” Well, of course you do --
Natalie. That was your name on
Gemenon, wasn’t it?
NATALIE
Yes.
CAVIL
Great job, by the way. Posing as a
reform advocate. Natalie Faust,
“Leading the charge against
political corruption.” And thanks
to you, we knew where all the
Gemenese leaders were when we
launched the nukes. Some died in
the arms of their mistresses.
NATALIE
I did what I was asked to --
CAVIL
(ON her dialogue, his bad
mood ON like a switch)
-- You know what really rankles my
ass? You’ve been pointing fingers,
falsely accusing me of manipulation
just short of tyranny when you’re
the one leading the charge here.
NATALIE
We want you to stop --
CAVIL
You’re not on Gemenon, Six! You’re
not in charge. We voted.

(CONTINUED)
The process has already begun.
(backing off, SIGHS)
You know what? In the long run
you’re going to thank me. Us.
Natalie pauses. Then...
NATALIE
For the last time: Will you stop
lobotomizing the Raiders?
CAVIL
(to the others)
Can you believe this?
(to Natalie)
For the last time: NO.
NATALIE
I was afraid you’d say that.
(CALLING OUT)
COME IN!
TWO GLEAMING CENTURIONS march in and take position on each
side of Natalie. Cavil rolls his eyes. Wearily aggravated.
CAVIL
Cute. Centurions can’t vote, Six.
NATALIE
They’re not here to vote, Cavil.
Natalie NODS her head to The Centurions. Cavil watches in
disbelief as The Centurions’ appendages morph into machine
guns. The Centurions have armed themselves.

ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
34 INT. GALACTICA - LAUNCH TUBE - ADAMA 34
hunkered in the cockpit of Kara’s Viper. He gives the thumbsup
sign and it SCREAMS down the LAUNCH TUBE and into...
35 EXT. SPACE 35
Kara’s Viper, with Adama in it, spits out of GALACTICA.
36 INT. KARA’S VIPER 36
Adama, mad at the universe...
LSO’S VOICE (RADIO)
Admiral/LSO. You are cleared into --
...FLIPS OFF his radio and hits THE AFTER-BURNERS.
CUT TO:
37 INT. CYLON BASE SHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM 37
Cavil’s had enough. Angry. Scowling, he means business.
CAVIL
This is no longer funny.
(to the Centurions)
Leave!
(glaring at Natalie)
You’ve got some serious problems,
Six, you know that?
(to the Centurions)
I said LEAVE!
But the Centurions don’t leave.
38 INT. KARA’S VIPER - ADAMA 38
Tearing a blue streak into space, his face hardened,
Galactica and The Fleet shrinking behind him.
39 INT. BASE SHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM - CAVIL 39
wide-eyed and railing at Natalie.
CAVIL
Why won’t they leave?
'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/07 49.
(CONTINUED)
Natalie removes THE OBJECT from the inside pocket of her
blazer. She tosses it to Cavil, who fumbles, but catches it.
NATALIE
The Telencephalic inhibitor that
restricts higher functions in The
Centurions. We had them removed.
CAVIL
SAY AGAIN?
NATALIE
You dumbed down the Raiders. We,
the Leobens, the Sharons gave the
Centurions the gift of reason.
Alarmed, the Simons and Dorals start to rise with Cavil,
already standing.
40 INT. KARA’S VIPER - ADAMA 40
ROARING in agony. He passes through an Astroid field.
41 INT. BASE SHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM - CAVIL 41
frowning at THE OBJECT in his hand.
NATALIE
Think of it as a little keepsake.
CAVIL
You have no authority to do this.
None. You can’t do anything
without a vote.
NATALIE
No... we can’t do anything with
one. So we’re finished voting.

39 CONTINUED: 39
(CONTINUED)
Cavil, The Simons, and The Dorals are startled by distant
MACHINE GUN FIRE, coming from throughout the ship.
CAVIL
What have you done?
Natalie gestures to The Centurions.
NATALIE
The first thing they learned was
what you’re doing to the Raiders.
You can imagine how they felt.
The Centurions take a few steps forward, heads menacingly
dipping.
DORAL
(murmuring dread)
Oh, no...
42 INT. KARA’S VIPER - ADAMA 42
FLASHING ON KARA and THE SLAP he delivered. FLASHING ON
LAURA, pale and swooning. FLASHING ON LEE, closing his hand
on THE FIGURE HEAD. In a fit of anger and frustration, Adama
FIRES his machine guns, bullying the red buttons with his
thumbs. FIRING, FIRING, FIRING at
42A SPACE - THE ASTROID FIELD 42A
Adama blowing away pieces of rock and astroid.
43 INT. BASE SHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM - THE CENTURIONS 43
FIRE CEASELESSLY on Cavil, The Simons and The Dorals, bullets
RIPPING the room apart, lights POPPING, glass shattering,
clouds of dust, a Kandinsky spatter of blood on the ceiling.
44 INT. KARA’S VIPER - ADAMA 44
TEARS of rage fall from his eyes, all of his frustration and
conflict channelled into those machine guns, BLASTING AWAY at
nothing but space until the guns are hot, smoking and empty.
45 INT. BASE SHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM 45
Natalie, observing the carnage after the shooting’s finished.

46 INT. KARA’S VIPER - ADAMA 46
looping back toward The Fleet...
DISSOLVE TO:
47 INT. GALACTICA - KARA’S JAIL CELL 47
SUPER: ONE DAY LATER. Kara lies on her cell bunk, half-asleep
when the door swings open. Mathias and Nowart enter with Helo
and they roust Kara.
KARA
(struggling)
HEY - HEY - HEY!
HELO
Cuff her.
48 INT. GALACTICA - A CORRIDOR 48
Helo and the marines hustle Kara away, the corridor deserted.
49 INT. HANGAR DECK 49
As the marines deliver Kara to ADAMA, waiting on the deserted
hangar deck.
KARA
So what’s the deal. You quietly cut
me loose in deep space?
Adama regards her for a moment.
KARA (cont’d)
I’m not afraid to die.
ADAMA
Little easier after you’ve been
through it once.
KARA
It’s harder. Especially when you
you’re just seeing things clearly.
(then)
You’re making a mistake.
ADAMA
(nodding)
Maybe I am. But I can't take the
chance that you could be right and
not do anything about it.
'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/07 52.
(CONTINUED)
Adama gestures to a stunned Kara. Nowart removes her
handcuffs.
ADAMA (cont’d)
Helo hand-picked a crew for you.
I'm giving you a ship. If you can
stand the smell.
HELO
We “liberated” the Demetrius.
Sewage recycling freighter. The
party line will be that we’re on a
scouting mission, looking for food.
Profoundly moved, Kara looks into Adama’s eyes.
KARA
You think I’m right.
ADAMA
Maybe. Maybe not. But I know she
is. The President. She was right
all along. I'm tired of losing.
I'm tired of turning away from the
things I want to believe in. I
believe you when you say you'll
have to die before you stop trying
and I don't want to lose you again.
Now go find the way to Earth.
Helo looks on as Kara and Adama triumphantly embrace, we...
