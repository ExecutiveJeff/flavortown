Really cool atmosphere. I absolutely LOVED the music selection. Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). Drinks were great, well priced. Friendly bar staff. I'd recommend to friends.
Definitely a dive. Terrible DJ. And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music...I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. But on the upside, it's easy to find. And there's a lot of seating, which I loved.
The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order.There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip).If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light.
The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover.As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs.
Oh, hello white people of Oakland. Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. Thank you, we hardly noticed.
On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. :(
I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!
My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. The bouncer was funny and inviting. If you're in the area, go and have fun!
The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar.  There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light.
Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes.JOHNNY is the man. He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste.The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing .. from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin.
Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. Laid back grungy hipster vibe. Music was loud and I felt at home.
Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started.
It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party.  The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland...Cool ass people in there!
What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. We were singing along and dancing. If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back.
Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. Will definitely be back.
Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland.  After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place.  Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices.I'll be back!
The Night Light is the worlds best bar. Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape.
Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light.
I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable.
Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. They always have a DJ on the weekends. The photo booth is all kinds of fun. Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. The bar area and staff is nice. Prices aren't too bad for JLS. Looking forward to being back soon.
This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. His words exactly, "My bar, my money". I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position.
It's cool bar.  Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city.  Many of us like it just the way it is. Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars.
Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. Fun times.
I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out.  Reviews do not lie. The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local.
So. much. whiskey. Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face.It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland.
I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!
The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). Overall, a-ok :)
This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service.  Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good.  Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5.00 is totally worth it.  NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none.
This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch.Drinking with your friends.Having another one.And the fun never ends.Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley.Drinking with your friends.Having another one.The fun never ends.Or when you are hanging out at Fest.Drinking with your friends.Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end.Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends.
This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too.
Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works.
This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing.Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. Love you guys, keep rocking it.
The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods.a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. space isn't that big. you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink.on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back.
Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. The Night Light is brand new. Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. The interior is cush and luxurious. Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. I enjoyed the sound they had going. Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. I tried and loved the Wild and Free. Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. Both were 8 bucks each. Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. Night light, I hope you are here to stay. Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :)
The owner doug really cares about this place. Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously.
Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. I was very surprised that this was here. I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. The decor makes this spot feel trendy. There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. This is a great spot.
Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great.  The happy hour prices are awesome.  For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs.  Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop.
The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened.I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service.  Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend.  These guys deserve a crowd.Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site.
Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster.  If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least.  The venue is really small, but breathes character.  Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer.  Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par.  This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around.  You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here.  Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing.  Awesome place to catch up with old friends.  Drinks are definitely stiff.Wait staff is not pretentious at all.PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned.  Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either.
Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music.I haven't gone to any shows yet.
Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry.Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye.
My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night.  We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up.The doorman was awesome.  He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars.The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper.  That's 4 stars.  Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like.  Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often.However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here.  Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. i've experienced better."The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc).  So that was fine.But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay.  Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients.  Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced.One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him.  She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner).  Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends.Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail.  Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them.To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed.  There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around.  But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients.  Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly.  I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back.To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar.  And it wasn't a special occasion.  And there were a lot of people in the bar.There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet.  Let's hope they get it together.
They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. All of this on their second night. Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood.
This place is great. Always good tunes spinning. Really good happy hour. Friendly bartenders. Great for after work.
This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. We shared stories and hung out. He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. I own the Nightlight". The rest is history. All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people.
At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat.
Fantastic cocktails.Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  And I love the decor.I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue.
My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times." All in all, a really fun, adorable bar.
Went here recently for happy hour... what can I say? I'm a fan.   Love the decor.  On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends... something I appreciate.  My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work.  Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages.  "I'll be back."
Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night.From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe.With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time.Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele.Works out great for us Oaklanders. Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop...
Freaking awesome. The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!
Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends.
This place is amazing.  I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!
I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences.  We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice.
Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing.  Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too.  Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable.  Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times.
This is really the only reason I go out after dark. Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance).And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home.Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs.Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS.Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast.
The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music...but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks...but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better.
This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit.Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space.Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. I also had a decent Manhattan. Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. They also had some beers on tap.The service was very good. My bartender was attentive and very friendly. I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient.Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. Four Stars.
Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar.  They now accept all major credit cards. The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics.  The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon.P.S. I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!
Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good.
great drinks, awesome atmosphere!
I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners.  They were super cool and the service was great. We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good.  They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. Cheers!
Went on opening night and was impressed.  No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd.  Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed.  I'll definitely be back!
Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect.
Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces.  From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style.  The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun.  They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?).  By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years.  Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again.  Can't wait to go back !
Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. 5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about.
Really cool atmosphere. I absolutely LOVED the music selection. Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). Drinks were great, well priced. Friendly bar staff. I'd recommend to friends.
Definitely a dive. Terrible DJ. And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music...I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. But on the upside, it's easy to find. And there's a lot of seating, which I loved.
The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order.There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip).If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light.
The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover.As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs.
Oh, hello white people of Oakland. Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. Thank you, we hardly noticed.
On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. :(
I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!
My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. The bouncer was funny and inviting. If you're in the area, go and have fun!
The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar.  There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light.
Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes.JOHNNY is the man. He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste.The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing .. from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin.
Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. Laid back grungy hipster vibe. Music was loud and I felt at home.
Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started.
It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party.  The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland...Cool ass people in there!
What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. We were singing along and dancing. If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back.
Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. Will definitely be back.
Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland.  After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place.  Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices.I'll be back!
The Night Light is the worlds best bar. Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape.
Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light.
I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable.
Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. They always have a DJ on the weekends. The photo booth is all kinds of fun. Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. The bar area and staff is nice. Prices aren't too bad for JLS. Looking forward to being back soon.
This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. His words exactly, "My bar, my money". I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position.
It's cool bar.  Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city.  Many of us like it just the way it is. Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars.
Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. Fun times.
I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out.  Reviews do not lie. The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local.
So. much. whiskey. Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face.It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland.
I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!
The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). Overall, a-ok :)
This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service.  Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good.  Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5.00 is totally worth it.  NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none.
This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch.Drinking with your friends.Having another one.And the fun never ends.Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley.Drinking with your friends.Having another one.The fun never ends.Or when you are hanging out at Fest.Drinking with your friends.Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end.Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends.
This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too.
Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works.
This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing.Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. Love you guys, keep rocking it.
The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods.a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. space isn't that big. you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink.on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back.
Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. The Night Light is brand new. Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. The interior is cush and luxurious. Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. I enjoyed the sound they had going. Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. I tried and loved the Wild and Free. Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. Both were 8 bucks each. Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. Night light, I hope you are here to stay. Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :)
The owner doug really cares about this place. Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously.
Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. I was very surprised that this was here. I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. The decor makes this spot feel trendy. There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. This is a great spot.
Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great.  The happy hour prices are awesome.  For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs.  Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop.
The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened.I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service.  Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend.  These guys deserve a crowd.Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site.
Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster.  If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least.  The venue is really small, but breathes character.  Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer.  Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par.  This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around.  You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here.  Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing.  Awesome place to catch up with old friends.  Drinks are definitely stiff.Wait staff is not pretentious at all.PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned.  Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either.
Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music.I haven't gone to any shows yet.
Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry.Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye.
My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night.  We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up.The doorman was awesome.  He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars.The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper.  That's 4 stars.  Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like.  Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often.However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here.  Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. i've experienced better."The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc).  So that was fine.But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay.  Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients.  Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced.One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him.  She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner).  Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends.Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail.  Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them.To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed.  There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around.  But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients.  Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly.  I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back.To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar.  And it wasn't a special occasion.  And there were a lot of people in the bar.There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet.  Let's hope they get it together.
They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. All of this on their second night. Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood.
This place is great. Always good tunes spinning. Really good happy hour. Friendly bartenders. Great for after work.
This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. We shared stories and hung out. He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. I own the Nightlight". The rest is history. All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people.
At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat.
Fantastic cocktails.Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  And I love the decor.I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue.
My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times." All in all, a really fun, adorable bar.
Went here recently for happy hour... what can I say? I'm a fan.   Love the decor.  On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends... something I appreciate.  My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work.  Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages.  "I'll be back."
Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night.From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe.With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time.Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele.Works out great for us Oaklanders. Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop...
Freaking awesome. The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!
Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends.
This place is amazing.  I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!
I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences.  We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice.
Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing.  Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too.  Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable.  Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times.
This is really the only reason I go out after dark. Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance).And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home.Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs.Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS.Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast.
The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music...but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks...but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better.
This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit.Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space.Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. I also had a decent Manhattan. Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. They also had some beers on tap.The service was very good. My bartender was attentive and very friendly. I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient.Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. Four Stars.
Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar.  They now accept all major credit cards. The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics.  The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon.P.S. I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!
Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good.
great drinks, awesome atmosphere!
I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners.  They were super cool and the service was great. We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good.  They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. Cheers!
Went on opening night and was impressed.  No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd.  Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed.  I'll definitely be back!
Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect.
Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces.  From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style.  The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun.  They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?).  By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years.  Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again.  Can't wait to go back !
Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. 5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about.
Great dive bar with outdoor seating area - which is not a common thing in the Bay Area. Simple, straightforward drinks. As with all dive bars, the bathrooms are not that clean, but you know, deal with it. Also, there was a not-totally-stable seeming lady who was yelling at women in the restroom to get out of the toilet faster. The outdoor seating area is really nice with some full trees for shade during the afternoons. Also, they seem cool with letting you bring in outside food and there is a cuban place, pizza place and burger place adjacent to the H&amp;D Saloon.
I would give this place zero stars and the Abusive Bartender badge if I could, after witnessing some rather horrific and disturbing behavior from a male bartender on a female customer that was 100% unacceptable.  Been going here for years, but after seeing that, never going back again.  Scary...
Don't go to this bar unless you wish to be attacked by a bartender. One of the bartenders first ignored me, then when I asked for a beer, started screaming profanities at me and then actually put his hands on me and started pushing me around. I can only imagine that if I had resisted him shoving me around, he would've quickly escalated to striking me, since none of this was provoked in any way. I will never go back there again, even though I've been going there since they opened. My friends are all boycotting this place because of this asshole, too.
Once a biker bar, now more hipster but the drinks are decent and the prices very reasonable. Nice outdoor patio. Only downside is everyone smokes. Oh... and cash only (although they have an atm)!
The majority of the people at this bar have been nothing but gracious and courteous to me. They've allowed me to bring in my dog, and it has been fine. Tonight, a bartender on duty, someone that I had met on other visits, was in rare form. He was discourteous. He was argumentative. He was mean. I think he was belligerently drunk. I have been a bartender and have managed bars and restaurants. You can check my yelp history and how often I have written Yelp reviews. Almost never. If interested, you can ask me which restaurants or bars I've managed. This sucked writing down one of my own, and I've never written a negative review of another bar before. It was simply the most offensively I've ever been treated in any bar or restaurant, ever, before or after working in the industry.
I stopped by for the Prince tribute last week.  Got there fairly early, just before 5pm. The CASH ONLY sign at the bar was an unpleasant surprise, and the ATM in the bar is one of those I just don't trust. Its connection seemed spotty too, as a number of people had issues with errors all in a row.  I ended up borrowing cash from a friend rather than risk it. Decent crowd; not packed and not empty.  The backyard was actually the fuller part because the weather was nice.  My friends and I tried a couple of the drink specials which were Prince themed (either raspberry or purple, it seemed).  Nothing too incredible, but we enjoyed them nonetheless.  It's a dive bar, not a cocktail lounge.  If you approach with that spirit, you'll have fun.
CASH ONLY (only downside, besides the parking meters which are ridiculously expensive). $17 pitcher of Racer 5. Great back patio. I'll be back next time I'm in the area.
Two words: dive bar.Personally, I'm a fan of the idea of dive bars. I mean, who doesn't love cheap drinks? I know that I do. Especially living in the Bay Area, anything that can keep some money in my pockets makes me pretty happy.Cash. Only. Ouch. I'm not someone who carries cash. That makes it so I drink less at places like this. It also has limited space inside. I tend to run cool, so I like to be inside which can be rough when it's busy.There's a pool table which is frequently occupied. I'm no pool shark but I enjoy putting my terrible physics and geometry skills to use...especially under the influence. It's always a good idea.So three stars. It's close and easy to get to but nothing super fancy or spectacular, over the top service. It's a dive bar so yeah...expect that.
Dive bars are more my style.  This spot has some real charm.  Awesome outdoor patio and smoking lounge. All sorts of characters, friendly fast bartenders, cool decor, and just that nice fun weirdo vibe.  Cash only!
like yelp said "Meh.I've experienced better." I just don't feel safe or welcomed going into that place I will say the redeeming factor are the cute dogs just hanging out around their owners.
Jumped to my Top 5 favorite Bars I've ever been to.Punk Bar with Pinball and great outside seating! Hell yeah! Service was good, prices were fair, and jukebox selection was On Point!
This place seemed a little too much for my style when I first saw it from the outside (as it looks like your average hard core dive bar, often with motorcycle groups hanging around out front). However I found it actually quite nice once I ventured inside. The area I like best is the back patio, which has a nice beer garden feel. I came here during the day but j can imagine it being a very poppin' place at night--it seems like a fun place to have drinks with friends. Will come back again at night.
Cool place with a typical dive-bar vibe. Cash only so be prepared - I almost wasn't! Outside was probably my favorite - a fair amount of seating, and they allow dogs. The problem is that most dogs have owners, and some of those owners haven't trained their dog how to interact with other dogs.Good drinks, bottled beer is probably the best bet.
it would be better with music at the Patio.
And gentrification is complete.  What used to be a laid back blues spot is now patronized by Hells Angels, never thought I  would see that at Lake Merritt.  Gentrification : game, set, match.
It's good straight to the point bar. I like to drink and they like to pour them, for a fee, of coarse. It's my regular waterhole for the past 5 yrs or so. They let you bring in outside food and it's one of the few places around that has a private patio to enjoy the nice weather and friends when the time calls for it.Note: Be sure to hit an ATM because it's cash only.
I love Heart and Dagger, yep it is a bar, but it is also the super sweet spot to shoot pool by my house, plus you can bring in your own food...awesome! I came to the stairs in the front of the establishment and I looked up at them thinking, "Wow, how am I going to do this with one foot?"  The bouncer, Gary, was really cool, he helped get me up there so I could have fun inside with all the other bipeds...lol.There is always such a cool crowd at this place, no matter what you like.  The juke box offers some really great songs, the kind of songs that remind you of moments in your life that seemingly make you smile.  I think last night I heard an old "Wham" song that lifted my mood. We watched a ton of Raider fans playing pool and basking in the glory of their win last night at the Battle of the Bay.  While the football game put my friend in a bad mood, the Raider fans were happy---let them have this little moment, it is not very often it happens ;)We attempted to go out to the patio in the back, and the ramp down into that area was yet another challenge for my one footed self.  But none to worry, there was a guy working at that back area too who helped me get around.  I have visited this spot for several years and have always had a memorable time--whether those memories be awesome, weird, annoying, ridiculous or fun, etc...I always leave with a memory.  Heart and Dagger is always on the crawl list for birthdays, and pretty much the "stand by" for any night.  We can play pool or pinball, listen to music, watch pretty disturbing movies on the TV, hang out in the patio, or just sit inside.  I am sure to run into friends from the neighborhood at any drop in, so that is always cool when I am out solo.  Stephani Smiles for HND ;)
Great place to have a beer and chill. The outdoor patio is fantastic. I'd give it 5 stars, but occasionally the clientele can get a little... roudy. And not in a good way.
The un-dive bar. I used to like this place, but the clientele is all highbrow now. I never liked that it was cash only, but I still love the jukebox. The last time I was there the skinny bearded doorman kept shouting across the bar to the bartender which was super annoying. I was unimpressed with his need for attention. Maybe early in the day this place is better but when it's crowded, nah. I was particularly amused by the weather-denying girl in the tank top showing off her tattoos as everyone else in the bar was in a coat and scarf because it was freezing outside and they had all of the doors open. Maybe in 1992 that would be impressive, but in 2016 you are one of many. Put your coat on, sweety. You'll catch your death.
Terrible bar with terrible staff. Rude door people causing fights with new patrons, and that was before anyone had a chance to order a drink. Not sure how a business with such terrible customer service stays in business. I wouldn't come back here again if you paid me!!
Let me just say, I've been here only a handful of times.  I don't come here enough.It reminds me of some of my favorite dives when I lived in the City, just wish I lived within walking distance ;)Great roadhouse atmosphere inside, and a chill backyard area.
Awesome place to come any day of week. They pool tables and arcade games. Cold beer on tab and bottled with a place to drink outside. Mediocre pricing but they aren't shy on their pours.
This is my go to dive bar in Oakland. Super chill vibe, mostly locals, and cool kids. There's a pool table, juke box and tables outside where you can bring the dogs, pizza and a board game...what's not to like??Drinks are decent enough, I recommend sticking to beer, racer 5 on tap..people seem to like the bloody Mary's and mimosa are perfect pre or post brunch. Love this place.
I've been here late at night and have had a completely different experience than now. Today, we arrived at the bar closer to sunset and hung out on the patio with my $3 beer. The ambiance and other patrons were really mellow and enjoyable. It's cheap, so that is a plus. The bartender, however, seemed to enjoy taking out her life's disappointments on the customers. I would've rather served myself. It won't keep me from returning, just yet.
My favorite bar in Oakland. They play great rock and roll inside, and the beer garden is a fantastic place to spend an afternoon, or play cards late into the night. There's tons of food in the neighborhood that you can bring in, and they're dog friendly. The pool scene is competitive and the table is better than average for a 'dive' bar (which the Dagger barely qualifies as). There's a great mix of people from East Bay Rats to local yuppies to SF expat hipsters and everyone gets along. It gets crowded but not too crowded.Just don't sit at the end of the bar by the men's bathroom -- you'll only smell urinal cakes all night. Unless you're into that I guess.
All hail the Duke! It was by the gracious invitation of His Majesty himself that the girlfriend &amp; I came to Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. &amp; what a lovely Dukedom it is.The Heart &amp; Dagger is sort of a dive bar, sort of. It's too well-lit inside to really be a total dive. It's divey in a hipster-ish kind of way. But the hipster to real people ratio isn't too high, so it's still cool.Full bar, impressive booze selection, nice cocktails, decent brews on tap, great Happy Hour deals, pinball/ video games &amp; pool table inside, dog-friendly patio out back, &amp; motorcycle parking right in front off the street. It's all good.We had a chill time time sipping a few drinks (but only a few, it's cash only here, I had loads of plastic but not a whole lotta green on me) &amp; watching Markus' reign of terror on the pool table. Until, at last, he was narrowly defeated by a very pretty young lady. Who says chivalry is dead?Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. I like it. I'll have to return as often as possible to see the Duke, his fair Dukedom &amp; any other shenanigans afoot.
Made my way over to oakland to meet up some friends at this sweet lil spot. Surrounded by plenty of parking and food it was a nice change up from SF. It is a cash only bar some come prepared. Full bar with some good beer on tap, and one dude holding down the fort on a saturday night. ( he was wicked fast). Outside is a sweet lil patio for a awesome place to relax and chat( bench seating) and the fresh air was great. The prices for drinks were right on, and no overly pricey with some good pours.
Cheap drinks, outdoor space, punk rock music -- YES.
You can smoke. Here. And drink. A nice well whisky and a good pour. Cash only. They check ID very professionally. The people who work there are people, not hipster asshats or attitudinal testosteronies. i like it, if you can tell. Ahhhhhh...
I can see this place is going to be my favorite bar in East Bay.-Great bartender, totally personable and cool.-Cool door guy, huge laugh!-Great patio, the likes of which are hard to find around here.-Giant Lemons.-Good mix of all types at the bar, everyone in a good mood.-Drinks were reasonably priced and poured strong.-It' close to my house.Basically everything needed in a bar that's going to be seeing a lot of this face.
This place definitely has the dive bar feel to it.  I'm sure this is a good local hang out.  What really appeals to me about this places is the outside area in the back.  There are plenty of tables to sit at.  Great place to go with some friends to relax with a beer and chat.   Although it does get busy and filled up so no guarantee you will get a table. This is a casual grungy type scene so jeans and causal attire is the standard.  I like the location and the vibe here though--super chill and relaxed..  There are a couple pool tables inside as well inside.  I'd definitely go back for a beer.
"Oh, he's very popular Ed. The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. They think he's a righteous dude."-- from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"A visit to Heart &amp; Dagger often reminds me of these words. As watering holes go, it may not be for every body, but it has a strikingly wide array of fans. And for us fans, it holds a piece of our hearts. The vibe is casual (read: 'divey'), distinctly Oakland, with a wild undercurrent befitting a David Lynch film. A biker bar only 'modestly' gentrified by neo-Oaklandites/wannabees/over-incomed geeks, to which I confess a partial complicity.  The playground segments into roughly three arenas:  (1) Bar area, where the bees get their honey -- and the barkeeps, both efficient and commanding, do a great job keeping the drones and workers happy. Beer specials and shots of liquor are an excellent value, especially during HH, when my lovely Bulliet Manhattans are especially generous. (2) Patio, definitely favored by the dog-partnered and smoking clientele, and seems to collect the more regular patrons. Gossip is overheard, smiles are witnessed, wafting cigarette smoke is inhaled. Water from two giant ThermosTM coolers is free and easily accessed for both two and four-legged visitors back here.And then there is (3), the pool table.  Where I learned, thanks to tutelage from billiards Maestro M and a few tips from other regulars, to now actually almost *not* suck at pool-playing.  Back to (3) in a bit. For the bar en masse though: at its heart of gold though does push the tip of its dagger, as visits here have not always been a feel-good utopian experience. I've seen people verbally insulted or kicked out for debatable reasons by the staff (actually mostly just one staff member, whose shifts are minimal); heard obnoxious comments by drunk and/or loud bigots; spied sketchy characters sporting knives in their back pocket, and witnessed a few "lively" disagreements over 8-ball. Admittedly, H&amp;D is an onion with many layers, and not all those layers are pretty.  The trifling edginess is in reality as much an allure as a downer, and a metaphor and microcosm of our world and city and a reminder that good or bad you're still a part of it so why not be a positive part or at the very least learn how to deal with it? In reality, I don't wax all philosophic like that when I visit here. Which brings us back to (3):  I do, truly, enjoy the regular pool players, and the competition and camaraderie I'm fortunate to have shared.  I'm a square peg for several reasons in H&amp;D, but the bonding with other such pegs or non-pegs is the reason I love to visit. And on those visits, I get to practice my shot, nurse my bourbon, and inhale the simple sideways joys that life has to offer.Can one sum up H&amp;D in a single catchphrase?  "All for one, one for all, just watch your wallet and drink." "You don't have to be a biker to come, but it don't hurt if you are one." "A bar of inimitable substance and a multitude of substances." Nah ... screw that. Heart and Dagger defies an easy Yelp review description. And I'm guessing they like it that way. Just be chill, be respectful, be unorthodox, be free, and be yourself. It's not to be analyzed. Just enjoyed.
If you like dive bars without the meth mouth, Sons of Anarchy watching patrons, Heart and Dagger will sit very well with you. (It's kind of not really even a dive bar, shh)They *are* cash only. There is an ATM with a $2.25 fee, but you get that back fast because their drinks are so stinkin' cheap-- and strong!There is a pool table room and (the best part), an amazing outdoor patio that is friendly to your cigarette smoking buds. It's kind of the perfect place to be on a summer night. Heart &amp; Dagger is a solid go-to bar in Oakland. Come here once &amp; you'll likely become a regular.
one of my favorite places! cheap drinks, good people, a big back patio that is open late. Home made beef jerky, aweful/good movies playing and dog friendly. also hosted by some of the best bartenders/doormen you'll meet. Oh, almost forgot. they have three pinball machines (including walking dead) and a decent pooltable with a good/honest rotation of players.
Love heart and dagger. My go to spot when I need a very laid back, wind down, kind of day.
I drink too much.  I came to that realization, drunk, during a disappointing pizza experience (why the fuck my bf drove us all the way to oakland for pizza who knows?)   What to do at 11pm on weeknight, drunk, concerned about how you will pay for Betty Ford and in Oakland?Heart and Dagger saloon.Sure, my boyfriend tells me he loves pizza more than me. Get me drink.Thank the Lord in Heaven he volunteered to DD.
As Kevin B. mentioned, if the Zeitgeist is too far of a hoof to get to, then H and D will do.  The back yard is pretty big and decked with communal tables for both large and small group outings.  We arrived armed with IDs out (although no one, but NO ONE in my party looked even remotely underage) and was met with friendly banter from the door man no. 1.  At one point I couldn't find my friends--not like the place is really that big, so I blame jet-lag for my confusion--and went back out onto the street to look for them.  Door man no. 2 had all the charm of a TSA agent upon my re-entry not 2 minutes later.  Maybe he thought I was some a-hole ABC cop trying to pull a fast one on him?  I wish the US could just lighten up a bit on ID checking, but I get why they can't.  Anyway, this place is an interesting replacement for The Serenader, if, however, not in keeping with the vibe of that which existed for decades in this very spot.  -a place where bitchin' BBQ reigned in the backyard and my white face was a minority.
Great dive bar to drink at on a hot summer afternoon - The big back patio is usually bustling, but not too crowded to get a seat at a table (usually).  Good beer selection, good service, good prices.  Ive seen people set up picnics on the patio tables so it's pretty cool that they let you do that. Great place to hang out.
Me likes.  Outdoor patio.  Everyone smokes.  Everyone has a dog.  Clean restrooms.  Cash only.  Good music.  Pool table and PIN BALL!  Don't try to bring chicken wings from Hot wings with bones.  Wilkie will not let you in.  The dogs are very important.
I was Chilling at the Slab when I get a Text from my Yelp Minister of Fun John Z to join the Posse at H&amp;D Saloon. So I jumped into my Whip Black Beauty and rolled to Oak town . I grabbed a parking spot right across the street.  Tip 1 no parking lot just street parking.So I roll in and see John Z and Markus dominating the Pool Table. Anne Marie shooting Deer in the Arcade. Home Sweet Home. Yelp Posse in full effect.Nice Big Bar ,Friendly Bartenders ,LCD TVs for Entertainment and a Cool Back Patio for Summer Nights or Days.A wide selection of Beers and a cool retro Juke box adds to the Charm of H&amp;D Saloon.Great meeting Spot or a Friendly game of Pool H&amp;D is the place to be.Tip 2 They allow outside food in.
This place is great. 2$ canned beer and really nice bartenders. If you are looking to meet up with a group of friends this place has a really big patio with plenty of space. Also it is cash only, so be ready for that. Loved coming here and will be back.
This is a neat, inexpensive, kind of gnarly bar in downtown Oakland. Definitely worth popping in! Don't mind the aggressive music and cool/weird stuff on the TV.Value for Money: 4 StarsCustomer Service: 4 StarsAmbience: 2 Stars (markdown for hipsters!)Location: 4 Stars
Heart and Dagger Saloon appeals to my mysterious and cheap side. everyday prices are cheap, HH is a bit cheaper.lots of entertainment options: pool table, pinball machines, video machines, juke box, flat screens. drink: gin &amp; tonic(4)-pretty strongguinness black lager(4)just so-soon draught:-happy hours(m-f, 4-7), $3 drafts, 3.5 wells -voted by bar 2011,  east bay express-voted best jukebox in bar 2011, east bay express-patio seating in rear-free parking under freeway after 6.-fast. smiling service-prepared to be carded-pizza, burger, wing food options nearby. .-many patrons wear leather and tats. clientele on the edge of heavy metal.
This bar has a genuine rock 'n' roll atmosphere.
Ah such a gem. My friend took me here to play pool about a month ago and now I go about once a week. There is usually rock music playing and something weird on the TV. However, If there is a game on then it will be on the TVs. They have pool and a couple of arcade games like pinball and buck hunter. They have an awesome outside patio with a bunch of picnic tables.  You can take drinks outside and people can smoke out there too.You can bring your dog! There are usually at least two dogs in the place which is so awesome. CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM.No food, but there are food places next door and you can bring food in. Love this place.
Well, my Yelp buddy Max has been going here for a while, and given that it's a six-minute walk from my house, I really have no excuse for not getting here sooner. Anyway, I've seen the light! This place is great. Pool tables are so rare here in NorCal! And a patio!And this place is right next to the parking are under the 580!
Decent prices, nice patio when it's warm outside.They allow dogs which is a plus.Good spot to hang low.
It's a saloon.
My head hurts, and it has nothing to do with what I drank last night.  Water; I should start learning to drink more water.  But what's a poor girl to do when a bar insists on serving her most favourite whiskey at such amazing prices??Heart &amp; Dagger - For years, I'd walked by this place too afraid of my own shadow to venture inside.  Then one day, I came across a photo someone took of the outside and discovered that they kicked it up a few dozen notches on their curbside appeal.  Then, The C. made me meet him here before showtime.  Who knew that it would become a small trend?I now can proudly say that I overcame my misguided fears and have found a sweet little spot on the ever changing face of Lakeshore Ave to call home.  This bar is perfect in its divey-ness, has a huge patio for perfect summer evenings, a nice little pool table that only costs $1 a game, and has an awesome jukebox that plays Flogging Molly and David Bowie!  Plus, the prices on the drinks are super inexpensive, and the bartenders are more than kindly souls that'll make you think of Cheers.You, too, should overcome your fears and check this place out.  I feel myself lucky to have been introduced.
Always fun...dive bar with a great crowd!!! Cash only FYI. Dog friendly which is cool and outside private patio...great place!!!
This establishment is hateful. I have never been treated so rudely. I bought one drink and tried to take a picture on my 21st birthday and the customers and employees were malicious in a creepy way. There was no wrong doing on my part, and yet my friend and I were assaulted by the bouncer and he tried to kick my friend. All we wanted to do was take a picture which we were told was okay, but the customers sitting around the mural were egotistical. Instead of the bouncer helping us get a picture he told us to take, he was on the side of the rude customer. We just wanted to have a good time but that's obviously not possible there. They were nothing but a bunch of creepy douche bags. Good luck at this bar. I would give this place 0 stars, if I could.
When Zeitgeist is just too far away...The Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon wins on the name alone, but on a sunny day after a picnic on Lake Merritt, it's a great place to relax with friends. Like Zeitgeist across the bay, it's got a biker motif and strong beer on tap, along with a popular backyard for catching up with friends. This place also has pool tables and a well-stocked jukebox (also like Zeitgeist), so it's better designed for long stays instead of a quick drink, and the crowd gets friendlier as the afternoon goes on. If you're having a thirsty afternoon in the East Bay, quench here.
Sooo ran to Heart and Dagger for a drink. After a long day.. Stood there while the ex zz top member bartender serves about 5 people that came in after I did... he finally notices my 6'5 dude ... And I "wave" to motion "over here" ... Since I'm paying...He emulates my wave ...extra dramatic then begins to reprimand me tell me to never wave at him again or he will just ignore me ... I said well I just waved cause you asked the guy I'm with what he wanted and I'm buying sooo.He said NO SERIOUSLY I DONT CARE...I wish I had a drink in my hand so I could throw it on him...FUCK THAT PLACE. And especially THAT BARTENDER .I miss places where black people were allowed and treated with the same respect as the transplants ...He felt completely justified coming at the ONLY black couple in the bar like that... Maybe I'm sensitive but really FUCK THAT PLACE. May it burn to the ground and be resurrected as the serenader again ...
One word for this establishment. RACIST. We are professional, well educated, LATINO couple in our 40's, born &amp; raised in SF and have lived in Lake Merritt for 10 years. We decided to have a beer on a Saturday night. The tattooed, black haired female bartender took our orders, delivered our beers..then THREW OUR CHANGE at us, for no apparent reason. Then the heavy set tattooed bartender says KICK ROCKS. For those of you who are not familiar with this term. Urban Dictionary definition: F*** OFF or GET OUTTA HERE. Shocked and utterly disgusted people like this exist in OAKLAND? REALLY? Thought we were imaging this, but Nope. Just read all the HIDDEN reviews, exactly the same. Bottom line. If you're brown or black. Don't bother. THIS ESTABLISHMENT TREATS MINORITIES LIKE GARBAGE.
Still the most awesomest bar in town!Don't go with attitude and you won't get none, epic back patio and cheap drinks. Better like friendly dogs, if not don't bother. This is a super dog lovin' joint, if you fear them stay away and don't complain about them being there...consider yourself warned.Props to Suzy, Allison and Eric...damn the whole crew over there makes my day. Just pour me a strong drink, talk like a dirty sailor and I'm yours!A Quality, respectful stand up business...all haters can walk the plank!!!xoxo!
Great bar to play pool and just meet new people. Very pet friendly and easy going great jukebox music and a spacious outdoor seating area..pretty hipster bar a great improvement from the old bar it use to be.
She suggested we meet at this bar in Oakland. I heard about it before and without context imagined it to be a seedy dive bar. I arrived first and sat at the bar. The bartender was nice, the drinks were very reasonable. My beer wasn't as cold as I would have liked. The crowd was definitely a varied mix of people. I walked around, and checked out the back patio. Then decided, this is cool place. My date showed up we had a few drinks.  The bartender randomly brought us a couple of free drinks to taste. One thing led to another and we left together. (It must have been the Funky Cold Medina)I would definitely like to come back and recommend this bar.
This is the only bar I like in my hood the bartenders actually remember who you are and always treat you friendly regardless of how busy they are. The mixed drinks are always good and the beers is always nice and cold.  I always love when summer is around because it's fun to see what the guest keg will be. The music is always great and the movies they play on the background are always entertaining.
Nice vibe and cool place to grab a beer and play a few games on a Friday night. They have a giant outdoor patio with tons of tables in the back and lots of arcade games and a pool table inside. It was kind of crowded when we went, so it took a while to find a seat and we didn't end up staying long enough to play pool but I would be down to come back and play a few rounds.
Enjoy being able to sit out back and enjoy the beers. Friendly staff is always a plus.
Soft opening tonight.  Big Daddy on draft.  Free Lanesplitter pizza.  Great friends and deep conversation.  If I didn't have a 10 month at home, I might find myself here MUCH more often.  Wish you were there Ben. :(On the way out I saw local newsletter wordsmith Ken Katz.  He was enjoying a Negra Modelo and surveying the territory.  He asked me what I thought and said he looked forward to my Yelp review.  This one is for you Ken!  Keep up the good confabulation.  See you in the hood.If you like Lucky 13 or Lost Weekend in Alameda, you will love Heart and Dagger Saloon.  Check 'er out!
One star for every sip of beer before my dog and I got booted.She was barking at another dog. Which I get is annoying and cause for concern. But she was only barking because she was leashed, and wanted to go greet the other dog. And she was only leashed because within a minute of walking in I was told I had to leash her. Which would have been fine and fair except that no other dogs were leashed. Which puts my girl in a weird situation where everyone else is meeting and greeting and she's tied down in a corner.  Hence the barking. I kind of wanted to point all this out at the time, but it's been my experience that nothing good comes from arguing with bouncers, so we left. Which sucks! For the 3 minutes we were there it seemed like a cool little dive. We live around the corner, and I was hoping this could be our end up after walks around the lake.
I've been there a few times and now I live a few blocks behind it so I'll be there a few times more.
Trumer and a burger from next door.Kwik Way is theshit andthis place is lucky to be next door.It's a fine bar. Decent.Dog central park today in the back.But I got a burger and a beer,so nocomplaints.
This place is cool if you are a trite, predictable cliché of a hipster / fauxpunk. If you like waiting 20 minutes for mediocre service and a can of PBR at 500% mark-up, please come on down to Heart and Dagger!Idiots are more than welcome to enjoy pretending at rebellion while leaning on broken, unusable pin ball machines.Don't forget that we offer a special discount if you are one of those girls with no particular talent and so you take your clothing off on stage assuming that means you're a burlesque dancer. Please hold your next "desperate for mom's attention" meeting here and get a free pitcher of horse piss! I mean Tecate!
I used to like this place!  What the crap happened?  The bartender wasn't just rude, it was some whole other level of maximum hatred!  Did she think I was someone else?  Someone who had stolen her husband, killed her dog, and burned down her house?  Because that's what it felt like.  Damn.After eventually getting a beer, we head over to play the pinball machines and they are in such a sorry state as to basically be a total ripoff.  Heart and Dagger, I can take a hint.  You don't want me to come there and spend my money, so I shant.
Okay, I admit I was only in here for 15 minutes, meeting friends before seeing a movie at the Grand Lake Theatre.  However, for a dive bar it's not really divey at all. Yes, it's dark and has pool tables. But everyone is really nice and the place is clean and not skeazy. Not only that but there's a great back patio. There's lots of bike parking out front and they don't mind if you lock up onto the railing either. The bouncer didn't give me any grief about running in then out, parking my bike right next to the front door (I asked if it was okay) and then leaving again without actually getting a drink. Definitely recommended as a nice neighborhood bar.
. Drinks are inexpensive and stiff .Cash only is a  bit irritating..Only one toilet Plenty of seating outside .I felt comfortable here and I think that it was because everyone was so friendly and engaging. I should remember to visit that side of the lake for a more often especially if I'm in the mood for mustaches, boys who ride bikes , tattoos and a slick comb over, oh wait...that is like... all day , everyday. Welp, alrighty then.
LOVE this bar!  It's charmingly divey, without being disgusting...unlike this one bar I went to recently who's name I will not mention where patrons just dropped trou' and urinated all over the bloody patio - sorry, but that's just nasty. I digress. H&amp;D's bartenders are hella' friendly and they pour heavy.  Seriously, I can typically hold my booze pretty well and one $10 pint-glass-sized-long-island had me buzzing preeetty hard.  There's a pool table that's almost always occupied by friendly people who are happy to work you into the rotation, puppies! (yes, puppies. It's dog-friendly), a nice outdoor patio for the smokers, tasty food just next door, a jukebox, arcade games, and an ATM machine (they don't take cards).  It's really nice to have this bar within walking distance of our house.  It's by far the best neighborhood bar I've experienced yet.
For saving my arse literally. And having clean facilites.I had  Trader's Joes and was loaded up with my bags when the urge hit to use the Bathroom like super bad like Damn I wish I had on a Diaper Bad like I might have to take a shit right here right now on the sidewalk and be on the bus hella shitty- like ( and deeply deeply ashamed). I dropped my bags and rushed into the Bar praying it would be friendly and not you-gotta buy-to shit. I was id checked ( I do look like a kid) and raced to the bathroom. Praying no body else would have to come in cause the bathroom was super tiny with one stall and no way to pretend the stink wasn't emerging from me.And there it goes a female patron enters just as I uh let go. Can't help but smell that!-Sigh- Oh well I am grateful it went down this way and not on the bus (feeling deeply deeply ashamed)
Well made, quality drinks with a cool dive bar feel. There's pinball and pool which makes it great for bro-nights. The patrons are stylish and friendly. I really like the back patio area.
This place is very cool.  Great drinks and service.  Next time I hope to get a spot on the über-cool patio.  I can't remember the last time I had booze and played the video game Galaga (spelling?) Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely be back.
This used to be the go-to bar for my friends and fellow Bay Area Derby girls. It was our hang out, we've given them a lot of business. But then today after a beautiful sunny day and a skate around the lake we decided to stop in for a drink. We looked on the outside for any sign about "no shoes, no service" but there wasn't one so we went in. Two of us had shoes, I did not. We proceeded to order our drinks. We saw a cute dog sitting on a bar stool and gave it some love. I got my beer and then a manager type abruptly told us we had to take our skates off, so we did. My friends and I grabbed our drinks and headed to the beer garden in the back (me in my socks). I took a few sips of my refreshing beer and Miss Cranky Pants told me that I must be wearing *shoes* or I have to leave. I did not have shoes so I got my money back from my beer and left the premises. It's too bad the woman was so prickly. The woman could've been much friendlier and more professional in her approach towards us but she treated the three of us with such disdain that it left us confused and surprised about her behavior. There was no sign posted about shoes in the front (only a sign about a 2 drink minimum)....they allow dogs in the establishment and they allow people to smoke pot AND there is no handicap access to the establishment...but somehow stocking feet is not acceptable? Would they ban people in bare feet wearing flip-flops? The rules just seem a little off and we certainly didn't deserve the rude treatment. Me, my friends, and the Bay Area Derby girls will not be returning to the Heart &amp; Dagger.
Proud to say this is my neighborhood bar! Love the atmosphere, puppy dogs and staff!
I don't usually review bars, but I loooooove Heart and Dagger! Beers are yummy, drinks are pretty good, but the best part is the patio. People bring their dogs back there, it's awesome!We'll usually come here and chill in the patio, maybe play some pin ball, then move to the next bar. We usually hit up Lanesplitter Pizza afterwords because it's so closeby. Delish.
Bah! This bar has so much potential. Yes! Go on a sunday and get mimosas. Sit out in the patio, and enjoy your day... then go wander to the lake and stare at the hobo geese eating cigarette butts...Noooooo, don't go on a regular night... the shape of the place is sooo weird and awkward, either you're in the way of the pool table or standing by a pole in the front, squeezed by the bar, or freezing in the back patio slowly absorbing lung cancer. I asked for a gin and tonic and got soda and tonic... talk about the most extreme of a buzz kill.  Soda is the hill billy cousin to city gal tonic. Also, just because this bar is called Heart &amp; Dagger doesn't mean you get to be a mean jerk...I repeat, get week-end day drinks here...
Cool, neighborhood-y bar with a lovely back patio area, a friendly staff and a great selection of beers and booze.There's good affordable food nearby and the place is usually filled with friendly locals.I dig it!
So, my friend just moved to the bay area from good ol' NYC, and we decide to have a night out on the town, to welcome her to Oakland.  Granted, we're both tired and lame after a week of work, so a night out on the town ends up consisting of one drink then home.HOWEVER.My one drink was a super cheap aged Jameson, and hers was a super cheap PBR tallboy.  WELCOME TO OAKLAND.We met my friend there whose pet pug (I'm sorry, he's a service dog, for real) is a regular at the bar.  Seriously, he sits on a bar stool.  WELCOME TO OAKLAND.We headed out back where it was beautiful outside, despite being the end of October.  WELCOME TO OAKLAND.On the back patio, my friend starts getting agitated.  I don't know why.  I realize it's because half the people here are not just smoking cigarettes, and where she's been living, that's still illegal.  I mean, technically, it is here too, but really: WELCOME TO OAKLAND.
Heart and Dagger is a great dive bar located near the historic Grand Lake Theater, conveniently nestled amongst other eateries and shops.- easy going vibe- back patio- outside food friendly (you can bring your own)- dog friendly-  fun (pinball, pool table, juke box)- be sure to bring photo ID - i.e. license, passport. State law requires that every patron have one (even if you look 21+) otherwise they get fined big time.- cash only (ATM on the premises)
CASH ONLY! cool patio in the back and cool staff. nice local hang out. it's very low key and chill. i'd go back if i was in the area and it was happy hour.
Went on a whim after a friend recommed the place to me....I had a great time. and too much to drink....lol... they ordered me a cab and someone offered to move my car for me since they had street sweeping early the next morning....what a nice thing to do....I would totally go back the vibe was pretty cool and the bartender was great...biker looking guy with a goatee....I'd like to give props but, I can't remember his name.....Had a great time
Well, this was a fun night!  A little dive-y, dark, and grungy, but I live down the street and have always wanted to see inside!  I ended up getting a mimosa for 4$ (I think...) which was pretty good.  The back patio is pretty cool, but I couldn't stay long because it was beyond freezing the night I went.  Also, do you think it might be a good idea to put lights outside?  Or, more lights outside?  I mean, its cool and all to sit and drink in the dark... but more fun to see the person you came with!  I really prefer the two seater RIGHT by the windows inside by the bar- so quaint and cozy!I read they once had a mechanical bull... am I wrong?  If they did, crowds would multiply, and I would be there every Sat!
Decent place, but the bartender could certainly have been less of a bitch.
What other bar would explicitly say on their website that their mission is to have cheap drinks with no cover?Hey, Yelp stalkers (that are dwindling in numbers every day)! Want to stalk for reals? I'm here every Friday without fail because this bar is so freaking awesome. Though it's not on the ridiculously cheap Happy Hour special list ($3 drafts and well drinks), their Dirty Martinis are some of the best I've ever had (still at a super cheap price!).Do yourself a favor and get there early to snag a seat on the outdoor patio under the lemon tree. The Heart and Dagger has friendly service (I need not mention their predecessors), friendly patrons, and an all together relaxed and fun vibe. Cash only, and watch out. I'll probably steal your seat on the patio.
Eek! Methinks not.That's exactly how I feel about this place, and the bartender helped out with that feeling.  By the way this is no Zeitgeist!  That's like calling Taco Bell authentic Mexican.  Anyway........Me and my lady walked in Sunday late evening around 7ish not packed but there was people.  I thought the layout was nice, games are cool, and yes the Jukebox is the God of Heart and Dagger.  Trust me if it weren't for that jukebox they might have got 1 star.  Ordered tequila with club soda and a bloody mary for the first round.  Hmmm I've had better and I wasn't feeling the bartenders dry attitude.  It's not like I wanted her to do cart wheels but damn girl smile at least.  We stepped outside to feel the vibe out there since there wasn't much of a vibe at the bar.  Beautiful lemon tree, plenty of awkward seating, and a big bummer is you can't hear the music outside.  We decided one more drink and depending on the bartenders attitude we would decide if we where going to stay or leave.Shot of Fernet please and one more tequila with club soda.  I received what seemed like half a shot for 6 bucks and a half ass thanks.  The guy next to me ordered a shot of Fernet too and it was beyond obvious his shot was double what was in my glass.  Whatevs I finished my shot and left.  You guys can all have this place cause it ain't fulfilling my drunk lover needs.
From the outside, it looks like someone simply converted their quaint little house into a public bar. Inside is a bit more rock n roll, loud music and pool. $2 PBR tallies make pretty much any hole in the wall a worthwhile stop for a drink or two. The back patio is perfect for a summer evening but gets crowded fast as most of the room out there is taken by tables. Dog friendly despite not having the friendliest of dogs.
You know what I like? Booze. You know what else I like? A bar that will give me said booze at a price that won't break my wallet (Ummmm, hello? Uptown? Your $8.00 Maker's shot can eat a bag of dicks.)This place is totally going to hit five stars soon. There are still a lot of small details that are getting worked out but you know what? The owners are hands on and working on them. I see them there almost every single night greeting people, talking to them about improvements... hell, I even saw one of them leave their guests they had come in with to help one of their bartenders who had gotten slammed and lost in the weeds.I've read the accusations of this place being racist and I just don't know what the hell you people are talking about. I can go on about it but giving it any more space than two sentences is giving credence to a line of bullshit that is just reDONKulous. There are few places in Oakland that I've found that allow me to feel comfortable with a wide array of friends. I can have this as my place to start the night, spend the night, or end the night. Oh - did I mention that Lanesplitters usually drops off pizza when they close? Yeah... free drunk food. All you one-star givers can join to Uptown on eating their bag of dicks.
I knew I would like this place when this was on the juke box while I entered youtube.com/watch?v=BIvk… There was once a time when this place was the Serenader and that place scared the daylights out of me. The patrons would shout at me when I walked past and I figured that heckling/intimidating patrons with the potential to scare off customers and I totally wrote about it on Yelp and it was #$%&amp;ING FLAGGED AND REMOVED because I violated TOS. Well, ha, it took two years for them to pull it. And, well, ha, MICHELLE S. WILL NOT BE SILENCED! HAHAHAHA!Sorry.Anyway, some time ago, I reviewed Zietgiest and was so pissed that the patios seemed to be in SF rather than in the warmer climate of Oakland.Guess what! Enter Heart and Dagger Saloon! I finally stumbled in to check this place out yesterday afternoon (they open at noon or 1 pm on the weekends) and it was a very great anti-brunch and anti-farmer's market thing to do. The patrons are very talkative and approachable. The staff is super friendly and efficient. They have an impressive bourbon collection and two types of sangria. And, most importantly, a back patio.Now if the Oakland Tamale guy would stop doing the Telegraph bars and come here instead....
Heart and Dagger... The name says it all. The best thing about this bar is they have cheap drinks and they have a back patio. I'm not a fan of going to bars where you can bring dogs. I'm from the super duper old school. Dogs should stay their little furry butts at home. As soon as i walked my fly butt out side to find a seat. The most ugliest poodle walked up to me and started liking my leg. This dog was going in for the kill, his nose was going further up my dress. I literally started screaming and telling the dog to get the hell away from me. OK i think yawl get the hint I'm not a dog lover. Now don't get me wrong I like dogs. Bottom line Heart and Dagger the name says it all. Please don't spend to much of your life at this bar unless you rock outfits that have skull and bones on them. Get my drift....

I have never been treated so rudely by a bartender (and we all know how they can be sometimes, lol). But imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the self-proclaimed OWNER of the place. I am still just shocked by her blatant disrespect of my friends and I, I still have absolutely no idea why we were treated in this fashion-- the only cause i could speculate is that I was with mostly people of color. shocking for Oakland, but i have racked my brain and that is the only thing i can come up with. The bartender did not want us there from the second we walked in and she made that very clear. Nor did she even care when I tried to address the matter with her, happy to hear she had lost all of our business forever. I see that a few other reviewers had similar experiences, how sad.All's I know is that I know a LOT of bars in Oakland that at least pretend to care about their customers. I will never go back to this bar, it's certainly no good to be so blatantly disrespected, but I'm certainly not going to PAY to be treated that way. lol.
I just moved to Lakeshore from Montclair, and you know what excites me?  The fact that I can walk to a bar and stumble home late at night after.  You know what doesn't excite me?  The fact that Heart and Dagger Saloon of Oakland is my local bar.Let's be honest, I haven't seen this many white people together in one place since Oakland's First Friday (or as I lovingly call it, "White Night").  The lay out is funky . . . especially the VIP raised table right as you walk in the door.  The outside is nice and I will definitely try it again in the summertime, but really, I don't want to go anywhere that makes my "ethnic" friends feel uncomfortable . . . .Looks like we're going to Easy.
Heart and Dagger is a-okay. The patio is gigantic, probably more room out there than in the actual bar. Prices were reasonable, but comparisons to Lucky 13 or similar bars with awesome beer selections and divey vibes are a bit uncalled for; there aren't that many beers on tap, and the crowd there (Saturday afternoon) was more likely to be reading the paper than to be chatting it up with fellow bar patrons. Dog friendly though!
i dunno what i was expecting when i heard this was a biker dive bar...maybe a little more dive and a little more hott bikers...? parking was easy, directly across the street...and well, the spot itself is pretty cool inside with pool tables, pinball machines, and a jukebox. The bartender worked up some strong drinks and the other patrons were pretty accommodating...the patio area was pretty big lined up with park benches to share, but the lighting def needs improving so us cougs could see which cubs are available to hunt! some of my biker friends rave about this spot because of it being biker friendly and maybe it just wasn't the night for them to be there...so i'll be back and give it another try, maybe on a saturday...check back and i'll let you know!
Walked in here for the first time and was like "so THIS is what the Serenader looks like from the inside!"Great out door patio, stiff cheap drinks, good jukebox, men with facial hair . . . sign me up!
Where everybody knows your name!We have been going to the Heart and Dagger since it opened, usually with me draped in my cool H and D swag.This is a throwback to a great neighborhood bar, with a little punk thrown in. We went last night to reintroduce our recently transplanted friends back to the amazing-ness that is the Bay Area, and ran into a group of friends. That is what I love about this place! Knowing that our friends all go there, and that we can catch up and hang out on the patio for hours is awesome!Boozy Suzy always makes me a delicious custom made drink when I am hanging out with all of the beer drinking boys, which puts a smile on my face every time.The boys love getting Lane-Splitters for dinner, and staying and talking the night away. Now, if I can only get Lane Splitters to carry gluten free pizza, I would never leave!
If you are looking for a dive bar, you can't do much better than this in Oakland. The drinks are cheap, there's a great outdoor seating area and plenty of people watching. It gets a little smokey in the patio, but what do you expect from outdoor seating at a bar. Pinball and Pool are also big pluses.
Love the fact that karaoke is not and never will be allowed!They pour great drinks with great prices and a very fun crowd to watch.Check it out!
I love, love love love Heart and Dagger! It's about time that Oakland got a decent rocker/biker/alternative bar!I've heard people call it a "dive bar" but it's anything but. If you love Zeitgeist in SF, imagine a smaller, east bay version. That's what you get at Heart and Dagger.Plus, you can actually go and get a few drinks and not spend more than $20. The jukebox is loaded with bitchin' tunes. The staff is super friendly. The place is Dog friendly. And they let you bring in food from other places to eat. And once in a while, Lane Splitters will bring by free pizza that's left over at the end of the night or wrong orders.It's cozy and comfy. All races, genders, gays, straights welcome. It's nice to see a diverse alternative culture and not feel like you walked into a snobby hipster bar for once. Heart and Dagger has certainly become my version of "Cheers!"
I dig this bar, I really do. The staff is friendly (even the door guys are nice) and there's usually a fun crowd inside. My favorite time to visit Heart and Dagger is on a lazy Sunday when the back patio is filled with dogs, cigarettes and tall boys. Drinks are reasonably priced, has every amenity you'd ever ask of a dive, and the bathrooms aren't gross! I can only speak for the Men's bathroom, though. Also, if you're hungry, Lanesplitters (as well as other awesome grub) is right next to Heart and Dagger, and the bar is totally cool with you bringing a pizza box in to share with friends.Additional bonuses: 3 pinball tables and an ATM machine. When their ATM machine isn't working, there's a bank 50 feet away. The only negative: When the outside patio is closed and the bar is packed, the inside of the bar will make you claustrophobic.
If I've said it once, I've said it a million times:  This place is great as long as the back yard stays open.  When they shut it down and start hustling us in at 11 or 11:30 or whenever it is, it is just way too small to accommodate us.  Inevitably this results in an additional trip either back to the Kona or the Ruby Room.I know they're trying to be good neighbors and I can respect that, but the early nightly closing of the outside is a total buzzkill.
While my pals and I were wandering around Oakland on a sunny day, we came here to get a drink and sit at their outdoor patio.  It was a bit of a 30-something meat market.  Since we were not really out on the prowl, it was a sort of hilarious scene.  We drank mimosas and watched a group of British men hit on any women who'd have them.  I don't know about what it's like at night or when it's cold, but I found it quite enjoyable in the lovely Oakland sun.  Not really worth a trip to the East Bay, but good if you're already there.
3.5 stars!It gets knocked back from 4 because the only beer I (kinda) like there is Sierra Nevada.  But this is a great last stop for when you don't care anymore and you just want to knock back a PBR tallboy or two. Classy!   Anywaaaays, it may not be the classiest joint but it is a lot of fun -- there are little video games, a pool table, and a large outdoor patio.  The TVs play the randomest crap, and everyone there is just chillin'.  Gets a little crowded, but that's part of the fun. And when you finally get kicked out, the Taco Guys sometimes park their truck outside, so you can grab an organic, free-range, vegetarian-fed taco (it's very important for your 2 a.m. drunk self to be environmentally friendly) to go with that last PBR.
Pitchers, pinball, patio! Great neighborhood dive bar. good location, average prices, dogs outside. Definitely plan on going back regularly.
This is now the bar I call my neighborhood favorite.  I love that it has an outdoor patio.  The one downside is that I'm a nonsmoker so if it's crowded it's hard to get away from the smokers but it's worth it to me to sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy a beer.  The beers are priced great, especially if you get there early enough for happy hour.  Dogs are allowed in the back which offers some entertainment if there are a few there.  The bartenders have always been very friendly.  I haven't been back in a while since the weather has been cold but the next warm, sunny day I have off work I know where I'm headed.
If the Lexington in SF and Zeitgeist in SF had a love child it would be Heart and Dagger. In recent years there has been a gaggle of gays moving over to Oakland, myself included, and we needed a gayborhoody hangout. I do believe Heart and Dagger fits the bill! A group of us went to Heart and Dagger and we knew we were "home" when Gary, any dyke worth her weight knows this doorman, greeted us! There were hugs all around! He has been working the door at some infamous lesbian parties in SF for years. He is an East Bay boy so he is right at home at Heart and Dagger. The bar has that "cozy" Lex feeling and the backyard is like Zeigeist's little sister. There is also a pool table indoors and it's surrounded by tons of raggedy old bar stools and a couple throne type areas to chill in. Random, but welcomed. Good, full bar with some attractive bartenders. Always a bonus! Prices were excellent. And don't worry hip straighties, it is a diverse crowd and everyone seems to be welcomed with open arms. We like that. Diversity good. Let's do the math: Cool hangout space+good bar with good prices+backyard space+Gary at the door+plenty of parking across the street = a sweet little gayborhoody spot we plan to frequent.
Eek!  Methinks never again.Went here a few times and thought it was alright.  After having my bike tires slashed and the bartender refusing service saying "I don't serve blonds" to my male friend....I'm done.Pros:Patio out backCute dogsCons:Rude bartenderOnly one toilet...which clogs and people still piss (and crap) in it until it's fullBike tires SLASHED....no sign in sight saying do NOT park your bike herePeople beauregarding the jukebox with annoying musicIf you're willing to put up with idiots for bartenders, nasty toilets, and flat tires please go here!
Five stars for a bar?  What caught your eye Tim?  What could possibly be that awesome:This F**&amp;ing place.Pinball: Sweet.Three of 'em: Even sweeterMaximum Force/ Area 51 arcade game: You mean I can get drunk and kill things ?,Pacman/Froger/Galaga/all sorts of other cool 80's hits, flashback out of the time I was in diapers.  RadJukebox with Iron Maiden and the Clash? And all sorts of other badass tunes? CheckCheap drinks too? I just shit myself in excitement.  Maybe I'll go to the bathroom to cl.....Holy crap there's a patio too?  This place gets my vote and my dollar. Its smaller than you expect but the folks tend to be friendly and loud.  Its a good time and theres tons of parking across the street.Like my lady said: It's a dive bar, but without the urine and cigarette stench.  WHOA.
I kinda like this place...Tuesday night &amp; about twenty patrons.Sierra Nevada on tap for $3.00(Happy hour until 7:00)Appears to be an old house @ some point in it' s past life,some new paint &amp; stucco made a large improvement.Fairly neat &amp; clean.Ping pong table in action in the back patio.Bar tender was friendly &amp; helpful with beer selection.Mixed crowd on my visit.Parking was no big deal (right across the steet.A big improvement from the last sh*#hole bar previously residing @ this location.Patio looks to be a good spot for hot summer nights...Go already!!!
Loved the pinball and the backyard seating! Cash only so come prepared. Great spot for a bloody mary on a Sunday afternoon. Bring your pooch along!
When this place first opened up, I thought it was pretty cool.  I loved the pinball, back patio &amp; the jukebox was pretty good too.  However, over the last year I've gone there, my impression declined from "great" to "okay" to "absolutely never again will I set foot in the place".  The first reason I started going was for the pinball, but whatever company leases the machines to the bar (California Amusement Group?) does not keep them in good repair.  Since they opened, I've been there to play the machines multiple times, and each time, every single one of the 3 games were in such disrepair as to make the game almost a complete waste of money because you couldn't make key shots for scoring (like an intermittent or weak flipper, or a semi-functioning plunger).  Eventually, I stopped going there as often because of that, but gave it another chance a couple nights ago because my friend's friend was having a birthday party there - BIG mistake.  My friend (also female) and I waited at the bar to get a drink for over 20 minutes while the bartender completely ignored us, giving no eye contact &amp; no acknowledgement that she saw us, while serving everyone else at the bar, including people who had clearly come up to the bar after us.  I'm pretty patient when a bar is crowded, because I understand that it's not an easy job.  However, as we got passed over, time &amp; time again, it was obvious that the bartender just did not want to serve us.  WTF?  There was even some jerk standing fully behind me who leaned over my shoulder &amp; shouted - "pitcher of Trumer" - who got served while we were still waiting there!  Finally, there was guy standing next to my friend who could see what was going on (who had also come up AFTER us), and then sure as sh*t, the bartender came up to ask HIM what he wanted, so he pointed to us and said "these ladies were first", and she scoffed &amp; said something totally dismissive like "okay whatever" and then reluctantly asked what we wanted.  After she served us, she started ignoring the guy who pointed out that we were next.  Okayyyyy - wow.  I'm not sure why we got that kind of treatment, but it felt pretty crappy.  I sortof wondered whether it was because I was an obvious dyke.  I couldn't think of any other reason why we got treated that way, unless maybe the bartender just has a problem with other women in general?  (I've seen other reviews by women here who have mentioned crappy treatment by a female bartender here as well).  In any case, regardless of the reason, this bartender obviously did not want me &amp; my friend's business, and the owners don't care that their patrons get ripped off on their janky pinball machines either, so Mission Accomplished!!!  I will never go there again!Sad, because it had so much potential.
My favorite neighborhood joint. It's cozy. The patrons are young, diverse, attractive, and take good care of themselves. The bar staff and security are really friendly. Nice change from comparable larger venues in the City. This is where I plan to bring my friends this summer.The music hits all my sweet spots--blues, rockabilly, punk, HEAVY METAL. The beer selection is good enough for me--and it's cheap! And if I overkill (which I almost never do anymore) I live right up the street and could crawl home if necessary. Perfect. If grog and whiskey ain't your thing, then be sure to ask for a Suzie-kazi if Boozie Suzie is slingin shots.Need something to pad the sauce so you can see straight despite beer goggles? Head over to Lanesplitter's right next door--OR DRINK SOME MORE UNTIL YOU'VE DRUNK YOURSELF SOBER.
I thought this place was cute. The drinks were great and super cheap. We went on a Friday night around 9 and it was packed. I thought the outdoor space was great. It had cute brick/cobble stone floor, lots of stringed lights and the cutes local puppy. I will say that the layout is ridiculous, they could have fit way more tables or at least some drink holding counters. i spent most the night reorganizing the space layout in my head. The crowd seemed a little young, college- single types, but everyone was friendly and calm-ish. However it was only 9 and the party was just beginning.they have pool table and pin-ball but they were packed and unlikely to be able to play.All-n-all: i would go back for a beer and hang. but after we left here, we stumbled upon all that is holey in Dive Bars.  Smitty's Cocktails, review to follow!!
Heart and Dagger is my neighborhood  bar hangout. For those in the Grand Lake area, it really is convenient which adds to it's draw. It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday night. It has a cool motorcycle vibe and some tough looking characters that frequent. While it has some diversity of character, however, it really is a hipster-ific bar.  Lanesplitters, the next door pizza joint, will often deliver the pizza at the end of the night. GREAT outdoor patio with a fun lemon tree. In three words: cheap, convenient and cool.
Everything I want in a bar: cheap drinks, comfortable back yard to sit and drink in (complete with a huge lemon tree in the center), good jukebox, decent not-to-cool-for-school bartenders, a first person shooter video game, and a non-douchey clientele.I love this place.
Can you say cheap drinks? Well, I use to pop up at this place before Heart and Dagger took over. The mgmt kept changing and it wasn't always safe to go, but they had great bands. It was called Serenadas. Soooooooo, the bar was finally sold to someone who knows what to do.The bartenders are super fast, super friendly, and always something weird, or interesting on their tv sets. They have pool, playing machine, and a HUGE patio for smoking. Did I already say cheap drinks?The music is a variety of rock, heavy metal, non heavy metal, and all sorts of other stuff.  Now, hopefully your a dog lover because you might see a few dogs or cats. Hard to describe the crowd, but everyone seems cool. Oh, for the 3rd time, cheap drinks!!!!! Oh, they occasionally give you free pizza from next door.Who cars about dog, different music, or anything else if you getting served cheap fast drinks. There are 4 other bars in the area if you don't like this one. Right by the grand theatre, plenty of cabs, near the bus line, so no excuse for you not to go. Check it out!!!!
The patio is large and dog friendly. Employees are nice. Bouncer is awesome. Pinball. Cool regulars to talk to. The lock on the bathroom door works (hard to find at bars). Free parking in a lot across the street.Excellent music. Off the top of my head, last night I can remember hearing Faith No More, High On Fire, The Cramps, and Slayer. The bartender was wearing a Minor Threat shirt and they had Grindhouse playing on the TV when I walked in around 5:30.It's a few doors down from Lanesplitters, who donates the delicious pizza they don't sell at the end of the night to hungry bar patrons.
Last time hanging out on the patio, I witnessed a Blue Heron take a GIANT crap on a couple of screaming girls. This is a great place.Good prices, pool table, good juke, and a PATIO! A backyard patio is so rare here in Oakland, so it scores.A lot of reviewers seem to have had problems with the bartenders. I haven't. The crowd is cool, too. Good people.I'd like to have a bit more room inside, and maybe a second pool table, but other than those tiny things, this place rocks.
This place is pretty great....The drinks are cheap here. &amp; of course, like most of the dive bars -it's cash only. Luckily they have a BoA and CHASE within walking distance. There's also this awesome pizza place next door to go to feed your intoxicated needs. Overall a great dive bar...a WHOLE lot better than the Ruby Room or Radio...(I think its the same owner?). The backdoor patio could use a little more lighting though and that nasty lonely blue bulb should be replaced.
4 stars as room for growth. Great little rock and roll neighborhood bar!(too clean to call it a 'dive')They've got  a pool table, a few pinball machines and one of those table ms. pacmans.Decor is cute, place is clean, and the jukebox is outstanding.I'm really excited about 2 things at this place:#1. Tuesday nights. (For DML)#2. The back patio. I can just imagine the awesomeness of meeting friends for booze brunches, or cooling off on balmy(ish) summer nights.
We wanted to get something to eat after the horrifying West Elm/Pottery Barn warehouse sale a couple weekends back and stumbled upon this place. The atmosphere is great - a bunch of food and beverage spots all under one roof. Kind of reminds me of Gotham West Market in NYC. I ordered the pork tacos smothered in a red sauce, topped with pickled onion and cilantro. The two tacos came with a side of pinto beans. It was good, the pork was tender, the beans were also good. I do agree with most of the other reviews on price, it is kind of steep. I think it was $12/$13 for two tacos and some beans. the tacos were little so I am not sure why they command such a high price. But they were good! If I was in the area again, I would go back for sure.
A friend said yeah let's go its delicious.  No. It's over priced mexican food that wants to be good for you. I ate a torta and may never come here again unless I need to feel good about my food choices or maybe I'll get a salad or something.  So don't go thinking your going to have mexican food as you will be sadly mistaken.
Love love freakin LOVE this place! The staff are really nice, food is EXCELLENT!! Great spot to eat for lunch even dinner. The tostadas on Tuesday are to die for! MUST TRY! MUST TRY! It'll never disappoint. P.s. Pork belly tacos.. I mean shut up right!
This place is one of my "go-tos" for lunch.  I have dined here about 6 times and each time it has been really good.  Service is limited since its a walk up and order place; they do deliver food to the table and are super nice.  Its a local place in the "Swan" center with multiple eateries as well as a fish market inside.  Handmade tortillas and creative "cocktails" (no hard alcohol, but they do make a good "bloody" style drink with cayenne pepper crusted candy sticks (have only seen these in Mexico before).  Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Oh yeah, I have had pork, fish, shrimp and chicken tacos - all great!
Today we got for lunch the crispy wild shrimp tacos and peach salad! Absolutely fantastic and delicious.I love this place. Although its crowded we found a table with 3 seatings right away.
AMAZING. Everything i've gotten here has been incredible and i'm a very big fan (in case you couldn't already tell) Their menu changes so there no guarantee that they will have a certain dish a given night. However, I was really impressed by the tamale i had here and the chicken anchiote. Comes with awesome sides of rice and beans, tortilla and everything tastes so freshly made. Some could argue this place is on the pricier side compared to standard Mexican fare, but at first bite you will realize its absolutely worth it and keep coming back like i do.
Cosecha, Cosecha, Cosecha. I have such a weird relationship with you. I truly do like you, but you are expensive. I recognize that quality ingredients and such tastiness do cost money. But, spending $15 on 2 shrimp tacos and some beans in downtown Oakland at a pretty casual spot is insane to me?! Were those deliciously large shrimp tacos so tasty? YES, albeit a bit sloppy to eat. Plump wild shrimp, tempura fried with some jalapeno on 2 corn tortillas was perfection. I went the blue plate special and at $15 with beans, I was shocked. I actually think I wish I bought 2 at $5.50 per taco. :: FRIDAYS only for those shrimp tacos, btw.:: So, there, I said it. I don't like dropping $15 on a casual lunch, but those shrimp tacos are so worth it. I've actually dined here quite regularly for lunch since my move nearby almost a year ago and you always ignite the same reactions. When I'm paying, I gulp and say: how much? But, then my food arrives and I enjoy, maybe even savor every bite and can appreciate the ingredients. And although your portions don't seem huge, they are more than enough food and quite filling. In the end, Mexican is one of those foods. You expect to pay less and when you don't, you're like, excuse me? But man, Cosecha is so tasty. From their tacos, to their tortas, to their quesadillas, I've always been impressed. *Seating can be a bit of pain, since this spot's located within Swan's Marketplace. A co-op of sorts for local restaurants where they share the seating space. Lunch time is always packed weekdays, but taking a quick glance at their Saturday brunch makes me think I've been sleeping on this spot for weekend fare.* Their guac is a good, but at $5+ for a small dish, it is totally not worth it.
Amazing Mexican food. Came here for brunch on Sat (just a suggestion, come here early for brunch) and had bacon tacos with eggs and a side of beans. All delicious. My girlfriend had the waffles (yup, waffles at a Mexican restaurant!) and they were fantastic. To round things out I had the Cosecha Margarita and it was delicious, with orange zest and real worm salt around the rim. I know we're coming back for more.
Cosecha has very good Mexican food. It's located in a food court-esque building, with a few other restaurants that all share common seating. My friend and I went in around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was bumpin. We both ordered a quesadilla (I had the grilled peppers and chicken, and he had the mushroom and chicken). We also shared some chips and salsa, and the iced horchata latte. The prices are bit higher than some Mexican restaurants, but I think it's worth it. I was impressed with everything. I thought the horchata latte was great, and actually complemented the spiciness of the quesadilla really well. The quesadilla was incredibly well prepared, and the salsa served on the side gave the quesadilla a great flavor. I really liked the vibe at Cosecha, and the food was great. It's definitely one of my new favorite spots in Oakland (along with Zachary's, Drake's Dealership, and OBTOWN)
Food = excellent. Price point = poor. Hence the 4 star average. I loved my food but as others have mentioned, I don't think it was worth $15/plate. Both my SO and I had the Grilled Chicken Anchiote. It is served in a cute clay plate over rice with guacamole and a couple tortillas. Perhaps make the guac optional and lower the price a few bucks? The quality was great and they supposedly use fresh, seasonal/ local ingredients which always jacks up price so I get it.. to an extent. But it's also not a sit down restaurant. It is cafeteria style- in a large building with other restaurants, much like San Pedro Square Market in San Jose if you've ever been. Oakland is certainly stepping up it's food game and this was a great example. I would recommend this place but don't expect your fav hole in the wall taqueria prices.
Chicken tacos are so good. I want to come back to eat these!Pork belly was ok. Verde mole was ok too, spiciness made up for the dull taste. Everything taste so fresh.Owner was super nice, bringing us our food.
Everything we ate was delicious and fresh!! We went during the breakfast menu tired the waffles... They were stinking amazing Best waffles I ever ate!!!!! We also had the shrimp tacos also great!!! Wish they served dinner early in the morning I would like to have tired the pork tacos ....
Decent Mexican-themed bar at Swan's Market with a modest menu, whether brunch offerings like the huevos cuaouthemoc (two eggs over beans and salsa de arbol, topped with avocado and handmade flour tortillas) or evening fare like a fresh, crispy fish taco. They also offer a few nicely done drinks like their pomegranate margaritas.Overall, the offerings are reasonably delicious, good quality, and presented nicely, although prices are slightly on the elevated side. As this is a small stand inside Swan's Market, there aren't many people working here so service may seem a bit overwhelmed or impersonal at times. Nevertheless, if you are here at Swan's Market and want something more substantial than, say, sausages, this isn't a bad choice.
The short: delicious tacosThis is a line-up and they'll bring your order type place. At lunch hour, this place is busy and the wait was around 15 minutes. While waiting, we watched some ladies hand-make the tortillas. Mmmm fresh tortillas! Watch out though. The tortilla chips are ultra fried and oily; I almost could feel my arteries clogging up. We ordered the daily special of two fish tacos (Wednesday and Thursday; Friday has shrimp tacos). I enjoyed them and wished there were more than two!This place (Swan's Marketplace) is an agglomeration of other dining eateries, which makes for a loud, crowded and semi-cramped atmosphere, though the afternoon light streaming through was a nice touch.
I can't remember which paper or publication I first read about Cosecha (weird that it wasn't Yelp - heh), but I distinctly remember that I had to check this place out because it was Dominica Rice-Cisneros', of Chez Pannise fame, new place. On my visit, I tried out two dishes: Chilaquiles and Breakfast Tacos. Both dishes were quite tasty, but it is definitely quality over quantity here! Cosecha sources fresh, local ingredients, so expect to pay a bit more than your regular mobile/taco truck establishment. Located in the Housewives Market (Swan's), you will find Cosecha in what I describe as an upscale food court. You place your order at the register, get a number and you will get your meal in around ten minutes or so. This place was one that I actually went before opening due to its popularity and I had things to do....like holiday shopping!There is plenty of street parking!My buddy and I when we totally beat traffic on a Saturday morning:Uh, what time is it?   Ten o'clock. They open at 10:30.                  |                            |                 O_                         O                 |                            / | \                / \                           /  \   _________________________________     Maybe I'll take a nap     What about getting booze instead?in the car.                              |                \                             |                 O                         O               / | \                        / | \                / \                         /  \   _________________________________     You are such an enabler!*    I know.                  |                            /                 O                         O               / | \                        / | \                / \                         /  \   _________________________________* = She really is an enabler!
Cornbread. Seriously, try the cornbread. Simply the best.
Cosecha is a Mexican eatery with a nouvelle California twist. It's located inside old Oakland's Swan's Market. Solid wooden benches-- amenable to communal style seating -- are set up in front of their ordering counter. I actually love shared dining like this; seems only fitting for a 'market' context.The open wall aspect of this market is attractive; chose to avoid the interior ceiling fans and be warmed by the direct sun. People sitting outside were accompanied by their pets. The ordering line took just a bit of time. I loved observing the hustle and bustle of the open prep station behind the glass.  While waiting in line, I perused the paper menu pasted onto the glass counter.  I was there towards the end of weekend brunch (they close at 3:00 p.m.) I ordered the wild shrimp tacos and the horchata latte, following the tip from Bon Appetit's August 2015 issue which featured Oakland dining spots including Cosecha.  Place your order at the counter and pay, then servers bring your food out.  The horchata latte was sheer cinnamon-y goodness served in a tall glass-- light, sweet, and tinged with coffee tones.  I thought it would be the perfect non-dairy counterpoint to spicy Mexican chillies.  The two corn tortillas piled high with batter-fried shrimp were nicely presented. The shrimp sat on shredded cabbage, were topped with a chili-infused crema sauce and garnished with jalapeno and cilantro. The tacos weren't spicy and the cup of beans on the side were well-flavored. The shrimp were high quality and fresh with a firm bite (none of the mealy texture of aquaculture-produced shrimp.) My only gripe might be the quantity size--too small.  The prices will reveal that this is not another street-stall taco shop although it functions like one. I paid around $15 for the gourmet, delicately flavored shrimp.  This place offers sufficiently unique taste that it's worth a special treat, but it wouldn't be my daily go-to, based on price alone.  There are plenty of more ordinary tacquerias for everyday dining.
I was originally attracted to this restaurant due to its iced horchata latte!  When I saw this on the menu I flipped with excitement and headed to Cosecha.  I was expecting an conventional restaurant location, but I found myself at a food market.  By no means was this a bad thing, it added to the ambiance of the restaurant.  The food is on a other level, often you hear about a place and it gets so hyped up that you are extremely excited to try it and it let's you down when you finally get to try it... well this is not that kind of place.  The flavors are stupefying!  Yes, I looked up a word to describe what I felt when I had the green pozole.  I returned and tried the fish tacos special and on my next visit I had the chilaquiles.  Needless to say, I am a big fan of this place and it's authentic and unique spins on classic dishes.  Only draw back, it's on the expensive side :(
Bomb tacos. Favorites are the pork belly and chicken. Veggie is hit or miss - usually too watery.  Tortillas are freshly made as you wait in line. Chips are greasy, crunchy, and delicious.This food court makes it easy to go out with coworkers when you're craving different cuisines; however, watch where you sit because vendors will get mad and yell at you to move if you sit in the wrong territory (tables are marked for specific restaurants in the shared space).
Cosecha is so fresh. From the salads to the tortillas for the tacos. Everything is made fresh to order. Love it
I have to say the fish tacos were heavenly. I am just in Oakland for the night and looking for a cure for my jet lag. Fish tacos were the blue plate special. They came perfectly done - tempura style, crispy with a little bite. Beans with a half an avocado came in the side. I will definitely come back!!
While having a group dinner inside the Swan Market, friends and I tried a few dishes from each of the establishments inside.  I thought the service at Cosecha was great and I liked the menu choices.  Only major gripe was the value.  For what we paid, I thought was a bit steep for what we actually got.  We even ordered the happy hour special which happened to be 2 fish tacos and a pint of beer ($12).  Unfortunately, the battered fish tacos were so small and didn't satisfy.  The tacos looked delicious, but were slightly bland.  They have 3 beers on tap which you can choose from including Modelo, an IPA and a chocolate stout.  Our group ended up getting 4 orders of the tacos/beer ($50+).  If you have a big appetite like me, you may end up spending more money than you anticipate at Cosecha to fill up your belly.  May come back, but wouldn't get the tacos next time.
This is the perfect place for a casual lunch or dinner date. I've been here several times with my friends and always enjoyed my experience. Cosecha makes anincredible selection of traditional moles utilizing authentic ingredients and old school recipes. I recommend the green mole and their fish tacos to any first-time visitors or regulars that are looking for something different to try. Also, if you're fan of Horchata definitely try their horchata espresso! It's my favorite!
WONDERFUL!!! Best fish tacos that I have had in ages! The chips and salsa were amazing as well.
Good food. Slight bit pricy but it is the Bay Area and it's downtown and it's quality food so it's worth it. The pork belly tacos were good the meat was light but crispy and the salsa on those were to dye for. The carne plate was delicious to real good food but dinner doesn't start until 530 so don't come earlier for that or it won't be there. I got 3 plates two drinks 50 bucks easily.
I've been going here for a couple years now and because of my resolution to Yelp consistently I am making up for my lack of a review for Cosecha.They have brought a nice high end twist to Mexican food and one of the first places to bring some style with substance to the Old Oakland area.  Since their arrival they've spurned many great eateries to open up around them.  Through all the change they've still stood strong with their versions of many classics. Think high end taco truck without the truck. The various tacos and quesadillas are the stars for me here specifically shrimp (when available) and the Mushroom quesadilla. They also do a mean horchatta latte if you are a horchatta fan. My only gripes are that shrimp is just a special on a specific day and that prices are a little high to be a weekly regular.
Very limited menu. One friend got the soft tacos with braised pork &amp; a side of beans. Delicious, beyond fork tender. Fresh, hand-made tortillas. This was a keeper and the highlight of our meal. Another friend got the chilaquiles with salsa verde. Same fresh tortillas as the tacos except that they were cut into chips and fried. Scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. The avocado was perfectly ripe and the crema made the whole dish a luscious bite from beginning to end. A good dish but after the wow factor of the braised pork, it was anticlimactic. I went against the grain and got breakfast. The waffle was yummy but different. They pulled it from the iron before it formed a crispy crust. It was light and fluffy. The interior was fully cooked but it was still moist and tender. I added the cajeta sauce which is a Mexican-style caramel. So good, I was literally scraping the tiny container for every last drop. We also got the chips, guac and salsa. My advice, skip the chips that were hard and stale and substitute with the fresh tortillas instead. For drinks, we sipped on strawberry limeade. So yummy, I was chasing the last drop around the ice. Located in the old Swan's Market, I liked the vibe of the place. It reminded me of a tiny and more homey SF Ferry Building. Very similar to San Jose's San Pedro Square Market. If Cosecha isn't your style, there were about 4 other stalls including one featuring Japanese food and another serving hot dogs and beer. There was also a wine merchant. I wish I had a cooler. There was a butcher and a fishmonger offering raw product for purchase. About 3 blocks from the 12th St. Bart station, it easy to get to. I will be back.
I had the most expensive shrimp taco here.. And it was basically one shrimp and one taco! Over 5bucks after tax.. I was still hungry afterwards.
one of my favorites!i've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of my experiences were great. the waffle at breakfast, the delicious pico and guacamole, the horchata latte.....all so delicious!
Did someone say vegan quesadillas and strawberry margaritas? If so, I'm all in!I love how Cosecha uses sweet potato in their vegan quesadillas rather than using some fake rubbery cheese substitute. They also do not skimp on the guacamole. You get some inside the quesadilla itself and some on the side along with a deliciously spicy salsa verde. You can also choose from mushrooms, green chile, etc to go inside your quesadilla.The kicker to this meal though, was the asparagus and braised chickpeas. It might have been a special, but if you see it on the menu, do not hesitate and order it! The chubbiest asparagus I had ever seen, topped with perfect chickpeas in a really rich saucy broth. I'll be dreaming about this asparagus for eternity.My strawberry margarita was also memorable. It wasn't overly sweet and actually tasted like limes and real strawberries rather than the artificial syrupy stuff.All in all, I really enjoyed my meal here at Cosecha from start to finish. I can't wait to try other menu items!
In the search of good Mexican food we wanted to love this place, and were really disappointed! We saw this place on KQED and decided to give it a try. We were there on a Wednesday around 5, restaurant was pretty empty, no excuse for what we experienced...Here are my complaints:1. PRICES: They are way out of line for counter service &amp; communal seating: $13 for two tiny fish tacos, $15 for Pork Adobado plate, $3 for chips salsa and guacamole. There are far better taco places (such as Tracy DeJardin's place in the SF Ferry Building) which are MUCH less expensive, better quality2. QUALITY: The food was not prepared well. Rice was gummy and EVERYTHING was super greasy. The chips and fish tacos were literally swimming in oil. No one drained a damn thing. Fish tacos were very smelly too. Probably should not have eaten them. Pork plate was missing avocado and had a few pieces of gross, shriveled zucchini on the side. Very unappetizing.3. PORTIONS: Chip order was sad. With only a few cold greasy chips. Skimpy on the salsa as well. Fish tacos were absolutely tiny and each plated on one small tortilla. WAY too expensive for portion size. Pork plate had two tiny tortillas.4. SERVICE: Worker at the counter was barely civil. I asked for extra tortillas with our pork plate, forgot them. Ticket was cooked wrong- one order came out far in advance of the other. The counter worker slammed down the pork plate about a mile away (we were sitting on a big communal table) from us. Very abrupt and rude.***I suspect the owner was absent and it showed. Place is run poorly! Not a good experience, we will not go back.***
We tried their duck special on the weekend and the food was awesome. The dishes are well prepared and the portion sizes were decent. They are trying to add a high end twist to their food. Their corn tortillas are very good, I think it is freshly made on site very day. It is a food court style dining in Old Oakland. The dining was casual and we could get beer and other food from the other eateries in the food court.I noticed many of the other customers getting their wild shrimp taco specials. We will try that when we go their next time. We did not know this place until we saw them on KQED - Check Please Bay Area.
The owner greets you right away and everything is fresh. I had a mushroom and cheese quesadilla. It tasted so fresh!! The next day I had the shrimp tacos. The best I have ever had. Can't wait to return.
It's sad that it's come to this... I used to love this place but it seems that in all the trendy-ness and influx of consumers in Oakland, people have just forgotten about customer service. In the past I have enjoyed certain dishes from Cosecha. (You have to know what to order here, as their meats can be dry, making certain dishes way overpriced) And usually the service is pretty good, not great. My last visit, however, was very disappointing. The line (which can get long here) wasn't, thankfully and I tried to place my order but before I could do so the owner (the female) called the guy at the register away. He was nice about it at first and said he would be right back. The owner was giving him instructions which was fine but as he kept trying to come back to me to take my order, she kept pulling him away (keep in mind that she was facing me and fully aware that there was a customer waiting the entire time) until he finally came back to me and said "we are too busy, I have to go help in the back and I can't take your order". Are you serious right now? How unprofessional and rude to keep a customer waiting and then ultimately TURN THEM AWAY?!? Get your act together.
What first called my attention to this restaurant was this Facebook post: facebook.com/permalink.p…They were obviously more than just a restaurant; they realized the impact of our everyday interactions and are helping taking responsibility as a community towards real change. So last week when BART went down halfway through my commute home, my husband had to come pick me up from Oakland. We decided to have dinner in the area and came here. I'm so glad we did! My husband and I split an order of shrimp tacos and carne adobada. It was delicious and the meat was very tender. I'm also not big on beans but OMG I ate em' up here! Also, homemade tortillas are never a bad idea. My 6 year olds had a chicken quesadilla with rice &amp; beans and drank horchata. They loved it! Very good food and excellent service. I also love the idea that this place is a bit pricey (hear me out!) It's always bothered me so much that people just assume Mexican food has to cheap. Yes, taco trucks are great and nobody gets mad at a cheap meal but Mexican food can be just as fancy-pants as the rest of ya.
Today was my first time trying Cosecha. I had the special which was 2 crispy fish tacos and beans with avocado for $11. Service was awesome! It is a bit pricey, so I don't think I will be eating here very often, but it was good food and Steve Kerr and his crew showed up and everyone was clapping. So for that reason, I will give this place another star. LOL
Fish taco special is a rip off.  Can get better fry and quality at Rubios. The fry was decent but the fish was whatever.  The torta made bread soggy, the meat was weak.  Overpriced. Customer service is rude.
Definitely a great Mexican food restaurant. Their menu changes, which keeps things interesting. I actually did take out one night and got the mushroom quesadilla and grilled chicken quesadilla. They were both very flavorful and delicious. Portion size is reasonable for the price. I especially liked that they used corn tortilla for the quesadillas. I also ordered their chips, which I thought were well salted (which I like) but drenched in grease. They were too greasy for me, but I still managed to finish most of them! Also the service was great. The person was friendly and helpful on the phone, even though I couldn't decide what to order. I picked up my order with no problems! Great experience, will come back to try all of their tacos next!
I'm basing this review on food quality as well as service.  It was a miscommunication on their part which delayed our order. My co-worker and I ordered shrimp tacos and honestly they tasted like shrimp donuts. We didn't enjoy the batter and there was not enough sauce on the tacos. The overall dish it was lacking flavor. Next time I'm going to Belly's for shrimp tacos. Problem solved.
WOW. The food here is incredible!  The selection is very limited (4-5 items on the menu), but we tried the tacos and quesadilla, and they were both amazing!!!  The meats were moist, tender and flavorful.  The sauces were perfect.  The tortillas were warm and delicious.This is food court style dining, with an option to purchase beer from one of the other eateries.  Super casual, you order at the counter and they bring it to you. Very delicous. I can't wait to come back again!
I'm going to eat here again because I only had the totopos but they were great. I wanted to try more stuff, but we were doing a day drinking order a bunch of stuff thing so this seemed the most appropriate.
One of my favorite places to eat in Oakland. They have delicious food that tastes homemade. I love their yam/mushroom quesadillas and their seasonal fruit salad with cucumber, pumpkin seeds, jicama, and citrus vin.
I was here for a business lunch. The menu is a little pricey but the food was good. To be honest, chips and salsa with guac being close to $6 was a little  excessive. The fish tacos, however were worth the cost. They tasted great, the fish was fresh, and the plating was pleasing. Surprisingly, I was full after the fish tacos even though the portion looked small.
This was my destination food stand for a while (before the influx of B-Dama, etc.) at Swan's Market. Focus on organic (when possible) ingredients and limited but well executed menu. We've brought friends here (HS &amp; MD) who really enjoyed it. J typically gets the tacos, guac + chips. Initially, I enjoyed their vegan tacos (been eating here since 2011), but alas, since then, I have noticed more and more salt. For the average person who is not sensitive to salt, I would recommend Cosecha.
Went for the New Year's Brunch today!Great food, but their concept of pay, get a number and the food is delivered is not working.  One of us got their food and the other had to wait a long time for their food.
We originally chose this restaurant because they were one of the few in downtown Oakland that had outdoor seating for dinner and we had our dog with us.Necessity soon turned into luck Sharee as we hungrily dove into fresh vegetables and equally fresh meats. My favorite meal was the blood orange salad with grilled chicken. It was the perfect mix of flavors with toasted pumpkin seeds butter lettuce and a fresh citrus vinaigrette. Portions are not too large (as I prefer), and prices represent the gentrification occurring in the bay area but still reasonable for the quality of food provided.
Great spot for post happy hour drunken eats.  I ordered the fish tacos, which are excellent, although steep at 13 pesos.  You basically only get two small fish tacos as well as some rice and beans.  The service was also pretty slow, it seems they only had one guy running back and forth taking orders at the register and waitering food out to diners.
The food is always good, but the prices or service are never consistent. I paid about 5$ for a meal one day and the next was charged 8$. Sometimes they are polite and other days incredibly rude...
I fell for the ratings. I had the fish tacos and if it weren't for the pickled onions and dressing, they would have been plain and boring. I was not too pleased. Previous commenter called it a"yuppie" Mexican place, I agree. Beans and rice were good, service was not so good. Be prepared to hunt for napkins, sugar for tea, and a fork in different places. Chips were real greasy and stuck together, but salsa was tasty. I should have tried the other places around here. I was really craving authentic Mexican. Not the place. I must have just ordered the wrong thing. So disappointed :-(
I've been here twice now and was very impressed both times. Friendly employees, the homemade chips and guacamole are great, as is everything else. The overall atmosphere is very friendly as well.
This shared restaurant space is creative and interesting--kind of like a very upscale food court. Food itself is super delicious. I don't usually associate Mexican cuisine with haute cuisine--I'm a cheap taco loving girl, after all, but if you're going to do Mexican with fancy ingredients, these guys do it exceptionally well. All dishes were delicious and freshly cook. Sangria was good, too.
Massively overpriced and small portions. I had two small fish tacos, rice and chips for $20. This would cost $10 anywhere else. Disappointing ripoff.
The torta is good. I have been here several times but today was different.I experienced the worst, absolute, worst service I have ever experienced in my life. The lady at the register and the owner were ridiculously rude. I was surprised at first because the owner is usually smiling, and for the most part, you don't run into issues at the register (register lady is rarely friendly). She said I placed the incorrect order over the phone and I'm responsible for paying it (4x the cost of what I ordered). This went back and forth for a minute until she finally charged me for the correct order. As I was signing the receipt, she told me to never place these small orders over the phone and that they are doing me a favor for this one mistake I made. I responded with, "this is bullshit." Both the cashier and owner, became increasingly rude, and at this point, had an aggressive and hostile tone and told me this is my fault. I'm a native English speaker with a law degree. The cashier has a thick Mexican accent. I also had the phone on speaker, with one other person sitting with me (she ordered B-Dama's pork cutlet), when I placed the phone order. This order was just for me. I'm damn sure I didn't make a mistake.  She told me to get out, to get out of a DAMN food court. I think this is a part of a bigger problem, a growing service culture of attitude and arrogance in Oakland and you're starting to see it in SF. I'm not sure what is causing the growth of a terrible service culture. It is a culture that lacks accountability, responsibility, and respect. As a restaurant, you live and die by your patrons. Each patron is an asset, extremely valuable, and deserving of respect. Sure, every restaurant runs into their troll or exceptionally rude customer, but even in this situation, it makes more business sense to take the high road and appease the customer. Who knows? maybe this growing attitude in the service culture is a response to Yelp, online trolls, and people constantly sh!&amp;&amp;ing on restaurants. Whatever it is, you should never act the way this owner and cashier acted toward me-- irresponsible, immature, condescending, defensive, and hostile.While I will never say their tortas are bad because that would be lying, I actually think they are pretty damn good, I will never spend a dollar at a place that lacks the proper decorum.
Delicious food.  Just had a quesadilla and pozole.  So good!  Will definitely be back.
Got the huevos cuauhtemoc, breakfast tacos, iced horchata latte, and a mimosa. The homemade tortillas make this place. HOWEVER, the price and limited seating puts a damper on the experience. A great place to try, but doubt becoming a regular.
We dined on the Saturday specials.  Chilaquiles, one with a smokey salsa Rojo and one with Verde both were well prepared and tasty as were the Wild shrimp tacos.  Everything was very fresh and made to order.  They have a good selection of beer &amp; wine. It is located in the historic Swan Market building &amp; shares an open dining area with another restaurant &amp; a bar.  You order, find a table and they deliver to your table. It was a lovely fall day and they open the doors and had tables on the sidewalk in addition to the dining hall. It is kid friendly.
Yesterday was the second time that I ate at Cosecha, and we came specifically for the Chicken Mole Verde blue plate special that is available on Mondays.The first time I had tried Cosecha was on a Friday night when they were featuring Wild Shrimp Tacos. They were incredible.To me, it is hard to find a fabulous Mexican food/restaurant. A Mexican restaurant that doesn't put a fusion twist on it, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for ordinary. You can find ordinary almost anywhere in the Bay Area. It's usually always the same. My best friend growing up was first generation Mexican. The family would get together and cook big regional meals from old family recipes. Out of the ordinary, but not necessarily worthy of the hype everyone tends to give for something "out of the ordinary", but it allowed for me to be exposed to really GOOD, "non-traditional" Mexican food at a young age.I LOVE Cosecha. I love that they don't have a huge 3 page menu. I love that their food is incredibly fresh. I love how clean their kitchen appears to be. and I love that you can see part of their cooking process. Good wait staff too!The food here is like eating someone's secret recipes.  The food has a "slight" twist to the ordinary, and almost akin to eating in someone's family home.The Chicken Mole Verde was fantastic (not your typical mole sauce made with chocolate). Consecha's sauce had a little bit of bite/heat to it, but it was spicy without burning your mouth, and without lasting effect. So pleasant to eat! To top it off, the chicken was nicely shredded and topped off with roasted pumpkin seeds, and a few slices of avocado. The beans...not your refried variety, were cooked to the right consistency, not overcooked and falling apart and nicely flavored, as was the rice which also was not your typical Mexican rice. It was white rice, though it did not taste like plain white rice. I'm sure that also had a secret ingredient. Served with warm corn tortillas.Did I mention that Cosecha has absolutely the best Horchata that I have ever had? It's not thick, it's not watery, it has a hint of cinnamon. I would like a glass of it every single day! Very refreshing during warm weather too.The food presentation is lovely and equal to any upscale restaurant. Each blue plate special had a nice cloth under each plate. The plates themselves were very nice earthenware. I just can't say enough about the entire experience.As others have said, Cosecha is in the old Swann's marketplace and is more like an open air food court.  You place your order at the counter, and they bring it to your table. If you are hooked on burritos at Chipotle, I would not suggest you go here.  If you are looking for really good, out of the ordinary, quality Mexican food with that "slight" twist, this is the place for you. Not cheap, but not expensive for what you get. P.S.  The food portions are perfect, but not "super sized".  If you are a big eater, you may want to get an appetizer.Can't wait to go back!
Cosecha is pretty good and I have only been here twice. Most recently for brunch. I got the Chilaquiles and we split the waffle. The waffle was like butta! The Chilaquiles were really good, but couldn't eat the whole thing. It's on the pricer side, but good nonetheless.
Food was delicious!!! Ordered the quesadilla with peppers and braised pork. The tortilla was delicious. It tasted freshly made. The pork was tender. It looked small when they brought it out but it was quite filling!! Pomegranate margarita was pretty good, a bit strong. The horchata latte looked good will def try that next time.
Fantastic place! Cosheca is honestly the reason I even started writing yelp reviews. I had the pleasure of trying their fish tacos, which were so fresh and had incredible flavor. The pinto beans really sealed the deal for me as they had just the perfect amount of seasoning and texture and really complimented the dish. Also tried their horchatta latte, which was simply genius. Service was very efficient and friendly and my food arrived promptly after ordering. I cannot recommend Cosecha enough! Already craving their fish tacos as I write this review.
Ok those shrimp tacos on Friday are LEGIT. We went other times and food was good but didn't knock my socks off. We WILL be back for these tacos ASAP!
Came on a Saturday for take out brunch.  Had the wild shrimp tacos, strawberry lime drink.  Amazing!  Even more so was the fact that I got a free chocolate chip cookie. All was delicious...contemplating going back for more!  Definitely my new go to for brunch in Old Oakland!
I've been on the hunt for really good Mexican food since moving to the bay area - living in San Diego (aka, California's Best Border Town) spoiled me rotten. There I was treated to the best guacamole and fish tacos north of Mexico. When I heard about Cosecha, I was over the moon... but while my high expectations probably weren't very helpful, this was definitely not a 5-star experience. The restaurant is buried in a warehouse maze - an interesting space, just a liiiiittle hard to navigate. We had a table reserved, thanks to a friend who plans ahead - but there was no one available to ask about said table. There was 1 server running around like a madwoman, and 1 guy at the cash register taking/filling orders, but no one else. People were wandering around uncertain as to whether they should seat themselves or wait to be seated... we finally went to the wine store next door (which has no door/sign/anything marking it as a separate entity) hoping to get our questions answers. The place just seemed completely disorganized.So here's how it works! It's family-style self-seating at long picnic tables, unless you make a reservation, and then you can get a private table in the back. If you wait for a server to seat you or come to your table, you'll wait forever - order at the front counter, by the register. The menu &amp; specials are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but beware: we'd come for the night's special, wild shrimp tacos, but they were sold out by 6pm. We were baffled - it was early and the place wasn't even crowded. Not cool to sell out of your Dinner Special at the beginning of dinnertime. They also need more staff on the floor - for 40 minutes we had water but no glasses. Which went well with our chicken/pork tortillas that were missing tortillas.The food was good - the kind of good you're psyched to eat, but not the kind of good you'd return for. We tried the grilled chicken achiote - chicken marinated in achiote with rice, beans &amp; handmade tortillas, and the carne adovada - braised pork with chile guajillo, beans, rice &amp; tortillas. Really good guacamole!! The tortillas were handmade and delicious; the rest of the dish was fresh but unremarkable. The people who work here are incredibly nice - but they're also really overwhelmed. Maybe now that Cosecha is so popular, they'll make it more user friendly...?
Mmmmm!!! Pork belly taco.... Never had anything like that before. You probably think I'm crazy but it had a savory cotton candy like taste. Awesome haha. The horchata was a little gritty. The chicken taco also had amazing flavor and was very tender.
Food court dinning with excellent Mexican food at a moderate price.  All of the salads are quite nice as well as the Carnitas and tacos.  It is great on Fridays when the Farmer's market is open.
Staying in downtown Oakland, we checked out Yelp for a good place for dinner. Interestingly, on Saturday night, not to many restaurants seem to be open in downtown. We found this place interesting per the description, plus it wasn't far from our hotel.It's an interesting concept for a restaurant. Only a limited menu but the restaurant is more like an upscale cafe stall. It's in conjuction with several other similar eateries each having different types of food, like pizza, oysters, all with a common eating  area between them.  We had the quesadillas and also ordered a margherita  pizza from the pizza stall. Very tasty food!! I would have given 4/5 stars, but the portions were really small for the prices paid.
We're all surely spoiled with the great eats at Swan's Marketplace - my usual entry point is through Rosamunde and I've never quite made it far enough to get to Cosecha - fortunately I went on a Monday when things are just a bit more mellow and conducive to browsing. I tried the pork torta with what appeared to be twice fried tortilla chips (no complaints there) and fresh guac - the food was exactly what I was hoping for and the portions were fair.  Now, spending $17 on a torta, chips &amp; a sparking water is definitely excessive and arguably insane but Cosecha isn't the odd ball when it comes to the modern urban lunch pricing that is nearing $20/person so it's hard to hold that against them.The menu is simple and from the looks of the other patrons plates all of the various dishes are a hit - definitely worth a shot..especially if you're in the mood for Cholita Linda style food on a Monday (they're closed).
Simple, and súper delicioso! Had the Blue Plate fish tacos and both my parents - who are hard to please- loved them! Also, the small black bean soup is savory and light. We topped it off with the cucumber-lime drink which was perfect. Tan delicioso que ni siquiera podimos tomar foto de la comida comimos tan rápido!
I can't possibly express how much I love Cosecha, or Swans Market Place as a matter of fact. The market never disappoints, and I never had anything I didn't love at Cosecha. We started with salsa and guacamole. We could tell the salsa was fresh and made with heirloom tomatoes from the color of it. The flavor of the salsa was vibrant and the guacamole was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Then we had the fish taco and pork belly taco. The fish was fresh, with nice and crispy flaky batter.  Pork belly was juicy on the inside and nicely charred on the outside. And oh my god, the chocolate chip cookie! So good!
The food may be ok but the organization and service are terrible. The help is incompetent and indifferent. Our most recent experience had them losing our order after we paid, and they didn't even have a record of it, and they hadn't given us a receipt. After over 40 minutes of waiting for our order, and being repeatedly told, It's coming right up. They conceded they hadn't placed our order and didn't even know what we ordered. We asked that they just give us what was available but that wasn't acceptable, so we would have to wait another 40 minutes to try again. So about then we demanded our money back and left. Previously we had asked a server to clean our table because it was cluttered and dirty from the previous diners. One young man took part of their junk, didn't wipe the table and never came back. We asked two more times before someone was willing to give us a clean table.
Blue plate fish tacos are a rip off.  Quality was fine, but you pay close to $13 for two tiny tacos that are smaller than an appetizer anywhere else.  Chips and salsa are not even included. I won't be coming here again.
I think they've done away with the $10 minimum on credit/debit cards? I came back here the other day with a major craving for their veggie torta, and they accepted my debit card. Yay!
Oakland is definitely up and coming and this market is apart of the gentrification process.  This place has a wine bar and they are installing some other restaurants to make it into a modern food court cooperative.  The lamb and beans were good, pork tacos were EXCELLENT (YOU MUST TRY) and the crab ceviche was ok.  The blood orange, pine nuts, and chicken salad was delicious.  I had the special hibiscus tequila cocktail and it was pretty good.  I appreciate everything is made from scratch!The service is quick and efficient.  Erico was really nice, not to mention extremely cute and charming.  This place closes at 9:30 p.m. Friday night so make sure you come early enough time to talk, eat and drink!  Parking was easy on 9th street.
Honest, solid, yummy Mexican food. High quality meats really pack the punch in flavor. Generally not a huge pork belly fan, but the pork belly tacos were amazing. The braised beef tacos I loved even more. Quesadillas were outstanding! Thick, scrumptious cheeses and vegetables sandwiched between homemade, rich, flavorful tortillas. House made chips and guacamole really sealed the deal for me. Do yourself a favor and have a Mexican mocha... or two! Sooo good! Not a fan of sweet coffee? The horchata iced latte is delightful. A must have to complete the Cosecha experience!
I've been back to this place 2 weekends in a row now b/c right around Friday night at 7:30, I start dreaming about those cornmeal waffles that they only make on the weekends.  $12 for a waffle isn't cheap (includes fruit + cream), but why budget your cravings?I've also had the Pozoles which is nice and spicy and good on a chilly cloudy day. Have also enjoyed the shrimp tacos, the mushroom quesadillas and the pork tacos - all are decent (but not exceptionally better than what I might find at my local taco trucks), but the waffles - that's what I come here for.
Unfortunately, for my first try at Cosescha the chef must have been out for the day. I ordered the special of the day, to-go after a long day. I got home and excitedly opened my dinner only to be greeted by a sad, sad little flake of fish with only a wilted piece of lettuce and a few slices of peppers. It actually prompted me to take my first yelp picture it was so pathetic. To add insult to injury, I now have to go back out to grab a real dinner. I should have checked the box so I could have rectified on the spot, but the reviews gave me the sense that I was in good hands.
The last time we ate here they weren't officially open for dinners and we got in by sending an email and getting into one of their community dinners. We had a great meal and sat at a community table next to this really nice couple who were just starting their catering business while still working full time at their day jobs.  Fast forward to now....their business has taken off (S+S Gastro Grub)...and we finally get a chance to use them for an upcoming company holiday party!  I tell this part because you can never underestimate the power of the community table in a town like Oakland.....and Cosecha gave us a warm and fuzzy feeling from the very beginning.Stopped in with daughter for a wonderful lunch today.  One bite of the yam quesadilla and I couldn't stop talking about it.  Just tasted so "real." The tortilla was flavorful and the whole thing didn't need the sauces that came with it on the side. Daughter had the queso fundido and the pozole and liked them both. We also had the horchata which was very good.I timed it badly that I came on a Monday, because there are no seafood taco offerings on Mondays. It would be nice to always have fish tacos on the menu.....but maybe that's fine, as then I wouldn't have tried the yam quesadilla!  Lovely atmosphere and super friendly service. We'll be back sooner this time!
Jackpot.  Blue Plate Special - fish tacos, with beans and avocado garnish. Twelve bucks.  Superb. Crisp, flaky fry outside and soft, luscious fish inside. The beans were so savory. This happening joint is in a big warehouse filled with other places doibg the same deal. Large tables are available allowing people to meet and mingle. Water is on all the tables.   So groovy!
I wanted a meal, not an overpriced "quick snack." Two little shrimp tacos for fifteen bucks? No gracias. It wasn't quick either. Left annoyed and hungry--won't be back.
I came on a Thursday hoping to get my fish taco fix but was sadly disappointed. How are two very small tacos with a side of plain ol' rice and black beans supposed to fill you up for $13? Topping the fish tacos were large pieces of jalapeño which overpowered what little fish I ate. In addition we got an order of tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were extremely oily and the salsa came in a small container which we had to ask for a second filling because we were hungry still. I do like the market but don't think I'll be ordering from here again.
Fancy, super hip, beautifully presented "Meso- American" twist on Mexican food. Familiar and surprising at the same time. Sangria was excellent!!! Pico de gallo was exceptional. Located in middle of downtown with lots of access to drinks or dancing afterwards. Portions are medium/small and prices are moderate/high- don't arrive starving. Would definitely stop by again for a pre-drinks fancy snack.
Its pricey, but this place has the best food i have ever had. Especially the pork in the pork belly tacos... Soo perfect.
I've been here a few times and am every time so impressed. The ingredients are absolutely as fresh, seasonal, and creative as they claim, and the execution of flavors is clearly well-conceived. This place would be easy to miss, so if you're in the area and love delicious, thoughtful, and bold Mexican food, don't miss Cosecha!
Best zucchini tacos I ever ate!  Guacamole was amazing, too.
1. I want to marry the chef2. Best chocolate chip cookie outside of the ones my mom made when I was growing up. 3. Get the corn - it will make you want to (see #1)
Amazing atmosphere. In a busy area of Oakland you can find this precious food court that has a home feeling. And Cosecha seriously serves you real Mexican food topped with elegant balance of flavors, also thanks to Dominica ( Chez Panisse for years )
I was walking to my car after lunch and looked to see what Cosecha's daily special was and saw Mole Verde con Pollo. There's always room for another taco right? $3.97 including tax.They've reduced the diameter of their handmade taco tortillas with the same amount of meats &amp; sauce making a much better balance between fillings &amp; tortillas. The taco comes topped with fresh white onions and pepitas (and usually cilantro yelp.com/biz_photos/bGc4…).Tender and moist (poached?) chicken. The mole is lightly rich and mildly spicy. They've had different moles for the Monday Chicken Mole special so call ahead, if you're looking for a specific type (Negro, Poblano, Verde, etc.)
Seriously? Don't knowI don't know what the big deal is. Fish tacos were ok. Nicely deep fried fish sitting on a piece of lettuce, sitting on corn tortilla with some aioli dripped on it. Unremarkable. Chicken tacos less remarkable. They did not have the quesadillas available (half the menu).    Horchata the sweetest I've ever tasted which, for me, not a plus. We ordered chips and salsa and got 10 stale chips and 1 tablespoon of salsa. Go to the Tacos El Gordo taco truck on International in Oakland for much better food at 1/4 the price!
Had the fish tacos. They were decent but not worth the price. Portions are small, service was disinterested at best. Cool spot though, lots of potential.
Holy frijol, Cosecha is delicious!I usually find fancier Mexican food to be suspect, but hey, I don't see any taco trucks in Downtown Oakland, and Cosecha has rave reviews. This hesitation was before I knew that they have butternut squash quesadillas. Had I known I would have made like a jumping bean and come pronto. This butternut squash quesadilla is amazing-and you have the option of adding meat or keeping it vegetarian. The carnivore prevailed and their delicious grilled chicken was added. That Oaxacan cheese is a lipid lovers dream-so good.  Their tacos I had on my second visit didn't dazzle me, but not much would after trying my drug of choice, the bnsquash quesadilla. I could definitely taste that the housemade tortilla and meats were quality, though. Love the open air space, friendly service (the owner gave me a free oatmeal cookie hotouttadaoven), and boon to one of Oakland's most picturesque blocks. I'll definitely be back to reap what Cosecha is sowing.
No stars the food was horrible.  The quesadillas were disgusting &amp; bland.  I tired to change my order they refused to give me another plate &amp; give me my money back.   She said that the shrimp was to expensive.  Never again will I come back here.  Rude rude rude
Sometimes, I just have to scratch my head and wonder about people's taste.  Yes, it's subjective.  But I can't for the life of me figure out why this restaurant gets such rave reviews. Is there such a dearth of good Bay Area restaurants?  After seeing this on Check Please, Bay Area and realizing that this place was just around the block from my work, I was excited to try it.  I ordered the Blue Plate Special of crispy shrimp tacos and a cup of the pozole.  The tacos came with a side of pinto beans with small slices of avocado on top.  The fried shrimp inside the taco was extremely greasy, and the oil tasted stale.  There was absolutley no flavor in the shrimp taco unless you put the chipotle cream sauce on it.  The tortillas were homemade, fresh and declicious.  The pinto beans were bland and needed seasoning.  The pozole was good (served with fresh tortillas), but had way too much cabbage in it (it was basically cabbage with a little broth) and a few hominy kernels.  The taste of the broth was great, albeit a little too spicy for me (and I like hot).Oh, I also had a chocolate chip cookie - which was tasty, but clearly just a Nestle Toll House cookie recipeOverall, I would not go back again.  I would rather have good, authentic street tacos from a taco truck then to have poorly done Mexican fusion.
Great for lunchCasual, airy spaceOrder at the counter and food arrives promptly at your tableChicken tacos are good.  Waitress thought we ordered the pork belly and she got super excited until we told her it was the chicken.  So next time we'll have to try the pork belly and see what all the excitement was about.Chips, salsa &amp; guacamole are also yummy as a filler.Lunch special - two tacos &amp; agua fresca = $9Not a bad deal
My bf and I thoroughly enjoyed our food at Cosecha. We got the fresh tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole as well as the pozole. The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful and we were happy with our selection. The mimosas seemed to use fresh squeezed orange juice.  Five stars for the food. Service-wise, there is room for improvement. My bf and I both ordered pozole and his came out very nice, and mine looked very sloppy and missing the toppings that he got. I value toppings more than he does, so I was very disappointed.  The waitress reluctantly offered to get me more toppings, but never returned. My over-easy eggs also came out sunny side up and I had to request it to be corrected, luckily it came out fine.
Tacos here will cost you an arm and a leg but you are definitely paying for good quality products. The pork belly tacos washed down with a horchata is highly recommended.
Very good, very straightforward but surprisingly sophisticated Mexican food. Think more a casual, "Frontera Grill" than a "Chevy's". You will not find everything slathered in cheese to the point of being a formless blob, bathed in a sea of refried beans. The spices are the main draw, and it's fresh and fantastic.It's counter service, and there are some great and affordable Happy Hour specials. There's also a super cute, kinda flirty guy at the counter, which doesn't hurt either. ;)Definitely coming back!
We were there for dinner last night. The atmosphere is interesting: trendy food court of Swan's market.Everything we had was awesome. We've tried the fish tacos (delicious), the pork belly tacos (amazing), grilled squash with corn and pumpkin-seed chile (awesome) and the mango-kumquat salad (mmmmmh). Their drink and desert menu is on the short side but gosh, the food is good.
I've eaten at Cosecha twice, now, and this second dining experience has really confirmed for me that this place is committed to homey, artisan like food with seasonal and fresh ingredients. I had the Blue Plate Special- fish tacos with a huge, savory bowl of black beans.  The beans alone were so perfectly seasoned and warm and tender with a lovely gravy/like sauce -- almost a really thick black bean soup.The fish tacos were composed of pieces of fried cod, a sour cream chipotle sauce, one slice of jalapeño, and some cabbage in a corn tortilla.  Beautifully fried fish that had a very delicate and light texture.  The service was super excellent and friendly and very respectful-- really top notch service.  Furthermore, the young man who served me recommended their house hot sauce-- which was bright with a great kick.The ambience is of an open air market; very comfortable and pleasant.  I am so lucky this place is two blocks from my office, and it's just perfect for lunch.
I really like the ambiance of this place.  Well, depends, I would imagine you may run into the occasional individuals who think they own the place because of their privileged lives (but that's another story).I ordered the fish tacos here (comes with black beans and rice) along with the Chips and Guac.  For the beverage, I got the horchata latte which is pretty awesome.  The fish tacos, beans, and rice were pretty good but for $13 bucks, I cannot say it's worth it.  I must say though that the chips, salsa, and guac were very very good and I would pay the same amount for that item.  My bill came out to be about $22 bucks.  Service: I would like to thank the employee who brought the food to the tables, and also took our dishes away later on.  Very nice and courteous.  5 stars for him!Would I come back?  Maybe under the right circumstances but would not go out of my way to.
Ok the huevos cuahutemoc are solid!
Great authentic mexican food! Ran into this place, I had the quesadillas best ones I have ever had at a restaurant! Homemade fresh tortillas! I will be back.
Food was excellent, atmosphere is hip.  We ordered the yam and cheese quesadilla for the little ones and they enjoyed it.  I ordered the pork mole.  It was extremely too spicy and the chef provided me with something less spicy that I could share with the kids.
Cosecha = Delicious beyond words I can't have enough type of food !!! Cosecha  is home to me :) I worked at Cosecha for lil over two years. Even thoe I no longer work there I still come back to enjoy the food with out the work lol everything is so delicious full of flavor I could eat any plate but I must have to say my all time faves would be them shrimp tacos follow by some pork belly tacos it literally melt in your mouth and I can't forget about my mushroom quesadilla with pork. If we talking brunch CHILAQUILES VERDES POR FAVOR !! but no matter what I get here it always need to come with a side of beens. Those beans OMG I remember taking my lunch break and asking for a plate of beens with chicken, sour cream, pico de gallo, Guac and salsa verde sooo simple yet so amazing. (To bad this is not a menu item :( sorry non workers of Cosecha) my now husband (boyfriend when I work at Cosecha ) LOVES them and he not a beens fan, for him me going to cosecha with out him is the end of the world. He would be like "but you know I love cosecha " Indeed we do and not only do we love Cosecha but do we love even more its owner and chef Dominica with out her we wouldn't have Cosecha !! She's just amazing I don't know who is happier us when we go or her when she see us. I would always go back to Cosecha no other food can compare. I love recommending Cosecha because I know I would get that "OMG the food is amazing I can't wait to go back thank you " hahaha never fails. I would deff bring my future kids for a kids quesadilla while sipping on a HORCHATA LATTLE I sure gone need that caffeine but it would be a treat as well :)
Cosecha is a really casual spot- you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. The shrimp tacos were great, and the breakfast torta was hearty and delicious!Come early if you want the horchata latte- they were already out by 1:30 :( Well, come early in general. They ran out of chips before we got there too...
Locally sourced ingredients with a focus on social justice. She trained at Chez Panisse. He's a professor at Cal State East Bay. How could you not support this fabulous restaurant?!
Excellent food. Everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious. I grew up in Santa Ana and have traveled extensively throughout Mexico and Latin America and can say that the food here is quite authentic and definitely flavorful.The green mole is fantastic and the handmade tortillas are a treat. I highly recommend the queso fundido.
Great Mexican joint. However, the portions are very small for a high price. I would suggest the tortas, over the the tiny tacos ($3.65) and pork belly tacos ($4.50). If you want good tacos for a reasonble price, head over to Mi Rancho taco truck on 1st ave and 14th street.
Food was good, can taste the quality. Pricing for a shop like this was way off. 15 bucks for two tacos.
So let me start with what is good: the food is decent and the seating area is nice and good for large groups as you can order at the counter, share large tables, etc. Staff are also kind. That said, the PRICE IS BEYOND the far reaches of reasonable. $15 for two tiny tacos and a bunch of white rice (and no chips included) is totally incommensurate with the prices and portions of other high end counter-order taquerias in the area like picante or tacubaya, even accounting for the cost of special ingredients like shrimp, etc.
original review, September 2014 (update below):WOW. I was expecting over-priced and small portions, after reading the gourmet menu -- But I got decent portions of gourmet served in sustainable to-go containers (no petroleum products, no plastic -- all recycled and compostable packages), for a reasonable price and very quickly. I ordered tacos and bean soup to go, on my way to an evening job. It was served with a side of beans, rice and tortillas. I had enough for lunch the following day as well. EVERY part of the order was outstanding -- The sauces, the garnish, the raw ingredients - all of the highest quality and absolutely delicious! Spicy enough to satisfy my preference for extra chili pepper. I also appreciate the ambiance of the place -- I was expecting pretentious, but it's like an open cafeteria with several options and a communal eating area. The server was quick and helpful. I will be eating here regularly.  Genuine 5 stars.** UPDATE June 2015: I had to downgrade my initial 5-star rating to 4-star. (See original review, above). Unfortunately, the past several times I've visited Cosecha, the server has skimped on portions, with my containers of beans, rice, and guacamole only half-filled. Come on, it's expensive enough with those little containers filled up. I've noticed that I get more generous portions from certain servers, on certain days + times... Less on others. I wish it were consistent. ...
This place is overpriced for the food that you get.  Seems to follow the food truck trend.  Not recommended.
I give this spot a 4 due to service being slow. I ordered and waited for my drink for some time and funnily asked for it. Maybe the drink with meal is the norm. The vibe is casual and cool but you will hit business lunches as well in full dress. The food is a farm-to-table concept. The tacos are tasty. They use a single tortilla. The braised beef has a dark, spiced sauce that was nice. The chicken had great flavor as well. Don't expect a massive menu
Last time I was here, their special wasn't actually a deal, it was just an item from the menu that was featured and written on a board, but it wasn't cheaper or 'on special' in any way. We ordered it, and it said it came with cornbread, but it did not. I asked and they said they were out of cornbread, although they did not offer to supplement with something else. Small portions for a high price.
A really nice and open location, with ample seating and a friendly environment. I tried the crispy tacos special, which came with 2 crispy pork tacos (there's also a vegetarian option), pinto beans, and avocado salsa. The tacos were actually pieces of pork wrapped in thick, fried taco shells. I was disappointed that there wasn't any filling like lettuce or tomatoes, but the avocado salsa was so delicious I was fine just dipping my tacos in that. Definitely a new experience and fun to eat! The beans were very tasty as well.Came back on a few other occasions and tried the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. The shrimp are HUGE (since they're wild caught) and super juicy/flavorful. The fish tacos were a bit of a let-down... I feel like the fish alone isn't flavorful enough to warrant a lack of fillings. (All the fish tacos had were cabbage, sauce, and a sprig of cilantro) Overall, it's pretty pricy for the amount of food you get. Definitely not one of the cheapest options around, but I guess you need to pay for the quality. And the wait during the lunch rush can be pretty long...
Had really good lunch here.Prices are reasonable, but the atmosphere is very casual. You order at the counter.We shared the posole. it was so good. Lots of cilantro and it had some heat to it. Might be too much for some people.I had the crimini mushroom quesadilla. It was perfectly grilled. The salsa that came with it was very good. And the guacamole was right on. Right amount of spice and lime.My SO's wild shrimp tacos were good. Two fried shrimps in each taco.  But the side of beans was little bland.Oh and we had a choc chip cookie, free for asking. It was on the counter.I would be definitely back.
When this place first opened I had the same complaints as some other reviewers here - high prices, small portions, indifferent service.  Here's the thing though:  This place has seriously upped its game over the past few months, to the point it is now cranking out some of the best food in the bay area.  No joke, this place is worth a special pilgrimage, especially on mole Monday.  The mole verde is just OUT OF THIS WORLD good.I almost always get the blue plate special.  It's a reasonable sized portion and the food is just exquisite.  Sure it's a little pricier than most east bay tacquerias (more at an SF level), but the quality and sophistication of the food more than merit the (still very reasonable) price.  They make their own tortillas and all the ingredients are absolutely top notch.  The presentation is also really well done.I like the set-up, too.  It's a particularly nice place to eat on a sunny day, with the open air feel and outside tables.Finally, the service has gotten noticeably friendlier over the past few months.  A trend I hope will continue.
It was definitely time to upgrade my review to five stars. I come here multiple times a week. This is my neighborhood spot and I always feel welcome. Love that the menu changes seasonally.
I'm not sure what happened to the people who got bad service because when I went the service was perfect and very friendly. I had dinner here on a Saturday night with my wife and we loved it, the location is great and historic the food was very good, fresh, great quality ingredients and good sized portions.The homemade chips are fresh crispy and really tasty, the tortillas are handmade warm tender and awesome, the beans are really good overall just super good mexican food, I recommend it.I am excited to see restaurants taking a chance with mexican food and not doing the same old taqueria thing.
The food is decent. Pricing of the tacos is a bit expensive. The customer service could use improvement. I will most likely not return due to the manner in which I was spoken to when I wanted modifications to my meal.
Love their shrimp taco and posole soup, love the food, love the ambiance!
If you are looking for a good heavy meal and unique beer in Oakland, the Hog's Apothecary is the place to be.  Its a small neighborhood restaurant, that has an industrial tap house feel.  The staff was friendly and service was great.  I would not say the service was particularly fast or slow, but servers were attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. I really enjoyed the beer list.  It seemed to feature mostly small local breweries (many I had never even heard of).  The variety of the beer selection was great and everything we tried was wonderful.  I love trying new beer, especially from small California breweries, and I loved that this restaurant offered a wide variety of choices. The restaurant does take reservations. They seem to be busy while we were there so if you can get a reservation I recommend it.  However (according to the website, only some of the restaurant can be reserved, so they also take plenty of walk-ins).  There are two TVs above the bar area, so If you are hoping to catch a game on TV they have you covered. Our food was excellent. All of the small bites were great. The pretzel was my favorite. That alone could have been my meal.  The spicy mustard was GREAT, but spicy!! If you love horseradish you will LOVE this mustard (and its perfect with the buttery flavor of the pretzel).  I had the Titanic salad.  It was great and plenty of food for a main meal.  My husband had half dozen oysters and ribs and he had nothing but positives to say about that.  My only criticism about the experience was that the restaurant was very warm inside.  The windows were open but it didn't seem to provide much airflow. Its a small space, so with the kitchen cooking and a full restaurant it can become uncomfortably warm.  Overall, great beer, yummy food and nice people.  We will definitely go back.
Pros:  fast and friendly service           Food is hearty and good           Good beer selectionCons: food is very heavy .....but it's good
First time dining here today.  Had reservations for Mother's Day.  We were seated quickly, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our waiter showed up.  I had been looking around, with pleading eyes, hoping maybe someone could take the time to get a mimosa started for a mom.  But no.  No water, nothing.  The place was still half empty.The food was really good though.My son ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits were kind of drowned in the gravy, so my son wasn't eating them.  I asked if he could have a dry biscuit and they said sure no problem.  Of course surprise when the bill came- they just had to charge us the $5 for the dry biscuit- which was about 15 cents of ingredients.  If they had warned us at the time they they weren't simply trying to help a customer be satisfied with their meal, and would be charging us, maybe I would not have been so annoyed.  But between the 20 minute wait for service and the nickel and diming, it left me not looking forward to a return.If you care nothing about service, this place will be just fine.
Visited today 5.4.16 I was working from home today and my friend stopped by to visit me. We got really hungry and decided to be adventurous and try a new place. The hog's apothecary has been on my list for quite some time now. I bookmarked it for their corn dog. It was pretty empty for a Wednesday at lunch. I guess it's to be expected. Sadly, they didn't have the corn dog offered today at lunch. I decided to get the trail park boy. Their bread is good! The mortadella was new to me. I liked it, a bit too salty. Actually salt was a big problem with our meal here. We share the supernova appetizer/starter. It was a mixed green beet salad with herb crème fraîche. It was so incredibly SALTY. We kind of forced ourselves to eat it when we honestly should've just sent it back or just stopped eating it. The only thing good about the salad was the toasted hazelnuts. My side salad that came with my sandwich was also wayyyy to salty. I didn't even try to eat it. We drank two jugs of water while we were there. This place was pretty disappointing. /: I wouldn't come back here unless it was to try their corn dog.
Excellent experience at this place. Communal seating, sports TVs, great service, and gourmet artisan food. Their products are quality, and so even though they're pricey, they are decently portioned. They change their menu every day, so that's exciting.
Fun place in Oakland! I came here for dinner with friends after a day of drinking our way through Napa.Outside, you'll be impressed with the big clean windows and inside, you'll find community tables and a menu with lots of beers...and a surprising amount of hotdogs. Most of my group went the hotdog route but I opted for the "Pride of Castroville" which was delicious with juicy artichokes. Fun service, chill atmosphere.
Lively, quality gastropub that's helping to put the area around 40th Street and Broadway on the map as a new dining corridor in Oakland, with a feel and identity that's distinct from gentrified Piedmont Avenue not far away.The first things you notice are the tremendous craft beer selection and the meat/pork-heavy menu. As for the beer, the selection is quite extensive and although it features mostly craft brews, it looks like it's been curated to be very comprehensive across all major styles. Moreover, if you have any questions about any single beer item, you could ask for a little taste, or you could ask for advice on what pairs well with certain dishes on the menu.And as for the menu, it is quite meat-heavy (although I assume some items may be vegetarian-friendly or can be made so). While items like sausages might sound steep at around $13, the portion size is tremendous, and the case of the "Got Seoul" sausage that they offered recently, it comes topped uniquely with Asian ingredients. There are even meatier, more substantial entrees available too, all with whimsical names to them. Everything is so meaty and delicious, you'll be "mmm"-ing with approval throughout the meal.The overall atmosphere is quite friendly and festive, with lots of communal seating, and the place can be packed most of the time. Service is also knowledgeable and friendly too. Chalk up another win for the 40th Street area and for the Oakland dining scene.
Your typical hipster joint. Bearded men, beer, beer snacks made in-house, pretzels.Crater Lake Root Beer was delish. Served in a metal cup with perfectly square ice cubes that don't get in the way, it has a refreshing but light sassafras taste. It's $5 for about 10 oz.Pretzel was pretty average. The mustard was more like wasabi pretending to be mustard. The malted mayo was brown mayo.The space is pretty comfortable but service was okay. No one came to our table for quite a while until we asked.
Awesome brunch. Hangar steak and eggs were perfectly rare and runny (respectively) and biscuits with friend chicken add-on was gooey and juicy (respectively)Draught iced coffee was strong without being overly bitter and creamy smooth cream.Service was quick and attentive and just as hipster as one would expect.
A happy find in Oakland.  Interesting selection of beers and tasty food.  I had the New York Reuben sandwich and was very satisfied.  The pastrami is almost shredded, which worked fine, and the flavor was excellent.  Husband had the meatball sandwich and enjoyed it tremendously.  Freshly made potato chips were perfectly cooked.  We will happily go back anytime.
This is a very difficult place to decide whether it's a 3 or a 5 star. I opted for 4 stars, and here's why. The ambiance is beautiful. The lighting is low and glowing, and extremely inviting. The overall setup of this restaurant is well thought out. And they have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap; different local breweries with brief descriptions. Their food is pretty good. It's a bit pricey for my wallet, but that's with the understanding the local (sustainable) farmers provide produce and meat. And it's good. Just beyond my budget for the most part. I have a pretty decent job and all, but this is Oakland after all, and $25 entrees, no matter how high the quality of food, is just not within my budget of reasonable spending for a single entree, not including drinks, not including  my partner  or her  choice of food and beverage. I will probably just stick to going there for some booze. The bartenders are great, the servers are somewhere between mediocre and great, and overall this business seems to have a lot of pride and it presents itself well. Definitely worth stopping by for a beer and scoping things out. It's very inviting.** honorable mention, this is with respect to Jack R review. Just wanted to make the argument that Jack's review is wildly inappropriate. Not only is it borderline chauvinistic with his constant mention of how attractive the waitress was, but it's inappropriate with respect to how his failure to order left the waitress to awkwardly make suggestions and order food for him, that he later, somehow, "realized" he didn't know what she had ordered, and therefore he did not like it. Went on to joke about how his friend nearly pushed the waitress into his lap, then complained about the food again. You're a douche, Jack. I think you should take your review down. **
My girlfriend and I went on a double date with two of our friends, and we had dinner at The Hog's Apothecary. It was a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd. This restaurant has communal tables which is something that I absolutely disdain. As someone who has a busy schedule and is in a long distance relationship, my time with my girlfriend, my friends, and my family is precious to me. When I finally get the time to spend with my self-selected company, I hate having to shout over strangers to avoid being drowned out by their own conversations. That being said, the communal tables at Hog's were not nearly as cramped as the ones at Homeroom. You still have to do a lot of yelling though. The hard wooden benches were pretty uncomfortable too. Everything else about the restaurant was really great though. They offer a preponderance of great local and semi-local beers on tap. I had the Buddha's Hand IPA from Berryessa Brewing in Winters, CA, and it was awesome. It was not overly bitter and had a pleasant citrus taste from the Buddha's hand. Everyone else enjoyed their beers as well.My girlfriend and I started our meal with a soft pretzel. The pretzel had a rich, brown skin and was light and airy on the inside. I really enjoyed the spicy mustard dipping sauce that came with the pretzel. The heat from the mustard hits you right in the sinuses (in a good way).For our meal, we shared the corn dog and the Jamaican Me Crazy sausage.Corn dog: Easily one of the best (non-State Fair) corn dogs I've ever had. However, I feel like corn dogs are kind of like donuts. Awful ones are still pretty good, and even the best version with the best possible ingredients is only a few times better than the average ones. Jamaican Me Crazy: The sausage was tasty, although the jerk seasoning could have been a little more bold. I only tasted faint traces of allspice. The bun pillow-soft and provided a textural contrast to the pop I would get when biting into the casing of the sausage. The potato chips were tasty too. While both items were really good, they do seem a little overpriced for what they are.Our service was good, although there was some redundancy between the servers. Several different people came around to take our orders and this led to some confusion when my girlfriend ordered a second beer and two of the servers mistakenly thought that the other one would get the beer. They got it right eventually though.Overall, I like The Hog's Apothecary and would come back another time for beer and a corn dog.
Every time I pass by Hog's Apothecary, it's filled to the brim with customers. The menu is filled with (overpriced) sausage options. I guess it's their specialty, but no way in hell I am buying into gourmet hotdogs prices anymore. I already think Rosamunde and Wurstkuche in LA are overhyped and overpriced so $12+ for a dog? I really don't think so.Instead, I tried out the brunch menu. At first look, everything is pleasant. The servers are nice, the interior is open with long communal tables, and they have an extensive "hipster" beer list. I'm on a Belgian kick lately for I get the two Belgian beers and they are both delicious. After we ordered the food, about 45 minutes have passed and we are already close to finishing our second beer. The service is painfully slow. In fact, I saw some other tables that came in after us getting their food first. What's up with that?They see us get a bit antsy and assure us our food is coming out. I receive my French Monsieur which is good, with a nice kick of Horseradish. I also try the Apothecary Benedict and must admit, the house made ham is quite good. Everything tastes pretty good but they are all pretty much heart attacks on a plate. The food is definitely better than average but not enough to make me keep wanting to come back. The problem with this place, and a bunch of other new hipster joints in Oakland, is that everything is "artisanal" but that doesn't mean it necessarily makes everything taste better nor does it justify the stiff prices. There are too many places in Oakland which offers a good beer list and hipster food, but it's kind of getting out of hand. What's next, $20 sausage made with baby dragon butt and foie gras? I digress but I didn't feel Hog's was a step above any other already existing places. That's why I'll give it an A-OK.
We brought some of our fam here, because I mean it has hog in the name--- why wouldn't we? They only serve beer and wine, so don't expect a full bar.  The menu is a great mix of stuff to share and entrees.  We ordered a mix of bar snacks, appetizers and one entree to share.  Everything was super tasty! The staff was super awesome.  The one thing that I didn't like was the bench seating (I need a seat back when filling my belly) and there was no where to hang my jacket &amp; purse.  We will definitely go back here to try more of the menu
My wife &amp; I decided to start out 2016 with brunch here today.  Brunch was quite busy today, so it was good that we made a reservation.  She started with a mimosa, while I had a pint of hefeweizen (a tough choice, as they have over 25 beers on draft).  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  You can get either maple syrup or gravy with this order, but I recommend the syrup.  The onion waffle and fried chicken are very savory, so the sweetness of the syrup brings a nice balance.  They use boneless chicken thighs, so you can forgo utensils and just dig in with your bare hands!My wife ordered a benedict, which comes with the house pastrami.  The egg was cooked perfectly, but the dish (along with the house potatoes) were a little on the salty side.We ordered a side of bacon to share, which could have been cooked a little longer.The service was excellent:  attentive, but not overbearing.  The place got pretty loud as it got crowded, but it was very festive for the holiday.
I was out Free Wheeling and I had a fresh Charge on my Ankle Bracelet . Today was a good day to eliminate another Book Mark .So I rolled to The Hogs Apothecary and Oaktown.I rolled up and Parked right across the street . No Parking Lot just Street Parking .They also have Bike Parking right up front. The Cool Thing is the Front Door Handles are Shaped like Giant Meat Cleavers.I was Greeted upon Entering and  Grabbed  a Seat at the Bar. The Furnishings are Very Sturdy and some of it is from Repurposed Materials very cool. Their Bar Menu and Food Menu Change Daily . They also Butcher a Whole Pig every Tuesday and they use every part in Meal preparation .They have 2 LCD TVs for Sporting Events .They also have a Nice Big Open Air Skylight .Their Bartenders are a Wealth of Info .They have several Micro Brews on Tap.I ordered a Whippersnapper -Southern English Style Brown Mild Ale . I Liked It.I then ordered a Chocolypto - Imperial Stout with Oatmeal and Cacao . I really like this one it was Rich and Robust .My Final Beer was Framboos / Batch 28 -Belgian Style Ale with Raspberries . This is a Must Order very Flavorful and Fruity .For Dinner I Ordered The Belgian Braise - House Butchered Pork Shoulder braised in Societe ale , heirloom grits , charred radish rapini  braising  jus ,hard herb- bread crumb salsa .This was very good the Pork was so Tender it melted in my Mouth . Yummy I also ordered a Corn Dog and it Came with House rendered Lard Fried Kennebec Potato Chips and Mixed Pickles . This was also good .My Servers were Very Nice and Prompt . I Paid By Discover Card and Rolled out.
The fried chicken was piled high and looked scrumptious, but it was raw.  Not under done, not pink.  Gelatinously raw.  I asked that it be removed from the bill which they did, but I was surprised our server didn't seem more alarmed by the fact that raw chicken made it onto the plate. This is fine if you like communal tables.
It took me awhile, but I finally got to try Hog's and for brunch, nonetheless.I came on a Saturday and there was a good crowd and we got seated right away. I had one of their many beers on tap, though I don't recall which one. I went with the Belgian Waffles with Fried Chicken. The waffles were savory and the fried chicken was a must. Otherwise, what's the point? The dish was excellent. Though the person I was with got the something else, it was very small for the price, even though my dish was a bit pricey as well. I don't remember what he got, as it is not on the menu online. The food is good and the service is good as well. This is a place I would come to every once in a long awhile, but certainly worth a try.
I live down the street so I always end up here when I can't make a decision on what to eat. Great beer selection and excellent food. Menu is always changing, which is nice because I can always order something new. The bartender told us they base their menu off of what is available that day. Also, service has always been super friendly.
I should have ordered the Fried Chicken.As good as that dish looked though (and as much as I wanted to try it), I knew I had to order something pork related.  After all, between Hog's Apothecary's name and their giant pig statue that hovered behind me, it'd practically be sacrilegious not to!  And I am not one to mess with the pork/bacon/pork belly powers that may be (all hail, Bacon!).With a menu that is constantly changing, Hog's Apothecary has a lot to offer, even if the day's menu isn't super extensive - roughly a dozen starters and sides, a handful of sausages, and a few different entrées.  What's more, there's beer and lots of it.  With over 25 varieties on tap (mostly craft brews), you could even forgo eating and just sample beers all night long.-- SPICY PORK CRACKLIN'S...$3(yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…)These cracklin's are crackin'!  Not only are they borderline addictive, but they really do pack some heat, as every piece is coated with a spicy, mouth-watering seasoning (don't forget the lime!).  What's more, the portion is quite generous!  A great starter for groups to share.-- BOURBON-CHICKEN LIVER PATE...$6(yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…)Although larger slices of bread would have been nice to spread out all that pate, I'm not definitely not complaining about those giant gobs either!  While every bite was rich and decadent, the taste was also nicely accentuated by the sea salt and the berries.  If this isn't the best one I've had, it wouldn't be far behind.-- SUPERFECTA SAUSAGE SANDWICH - Pork, Rabbit, Chicken, Tim's Brown Ale, Basque Chili &amp; Mild Herbs, Fennel-Onion Braise, Dijon Mustard...$14(yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…)The only blemish, but it was a big one.  I was hopeful for trio of meats in the sausage, but it wasn't even juicy, let alone flavorful.  Ironically, the braise had the opposite effect, overpowering whatever flavor the meat had with fennel.  Sadly, besides the chips, the only other thing I enjoyed were the pickled vegetables.As underwhelming as my order was, it really was the only "bad" thing about my experience.  Great food otherwise, an awesome selection of beers, fantastic staff (they let our large party split our bill into smaller tabs), and (relatively) easy parking.  Plus, with several long tables, Hog's Apothecary is grew for groups large or small.Also, it's worth noting that the rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit (we all ordered different things), so it wouldn't surprise me if what I had just wasn't one of their better dishes.  Especially since the starters were really good.  Rounding up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I wonder what might have been if I had only ordered the fried chicken!
4.5 StarsProsA great variety of draft beers + a flight option Pretzel was easily shareable and well done Fun atmosphereChill staff ConsUmmmm can be pricey depending on your beer choice Overall ThoughtsWhile I enjoyed my experience with the beer I want to come back for the food to see if it can be bumped up that last half star!
Order the meatballs (appetizer) and fried chicken. They have tons of beer on tap!  I was in the mood for cider and they had 2 to choose from.I can wait to come back here.  Such a gem!
Will not be returning. I give the ambiance, environment, resources (food and drink) a mediocre mark, nothing special. It was the service I wasn't happy with. I have not ever been talked to like that here in the Bay Area. I brought my service dog and two friends and was felt less than welcomed. Although we did get to sit down for a beer. Our waiter, the bartender, Josh H, near beginning of dinner, was kind of an asshole to my friends and I. He immediately had a tone upon first approach like he wasn't going to like us, asking about my small dog. I told him we had already talked to the manager and were welcomed to sit down... I felt like he would have told us to leave.Josh came over to my friends and I to get our drink order. My friend had a question which left much to be interpreted. Instead of helping my friend out he insulted her by remarking "how all over the place" her question was. I was floored. I later asked for a glass of water. Of course I had my dog in my lap away from others, I gave him a chance to drink out of the glass. Josh comes out of nowhere and immediately rips the glass out of my hand and scolds me. Stroke two. We were all ready to leave by this point. He returned with a paper cup of water for my dog. Sweet? Hardly. He also assumed we wanted separate checks when we did not. Perhaps he was having a bad day but a first impression is a first impression bud. Terrible service. Money is tight for most and I wouldn't waste a second try on somewhere that was just ok. In order to harvest a community you should probably be more friendly to your locals and their pooches. Word spreads fast.
It's currently SF Beer Week.  Like, I'm sad that I even had to work at all this week, but I need the money to taste the beer, so here we are.  Last night, the hubs and I met some good friends at the Hog's Apothecary as they were hosting brews from FiftyFifty Brewing.  I stalked the menu online, and many of their offerings are meat and pork and sausage and YES.  Our server was very friendly and very attentive.   A+Location - near (in?) Temescal in Oakland.  I hear this is a notorious hipsterville area.  No matter, this place is kinda by itself on a corner.  Walking in, there are picnic tables, so you sit community style with others.  There was a bar to my right, communal seating in the middle, and bar seating along the left edge.  I enjoyed the decor, but man, it's loud AF in there.  We were there in the evening, after 7pm and it wasn't super crowded, but it sounded like it. We were fortunate enough to be able to move to a corner booth so we could hear our own conversation. Beer - I sampled two beers and shite, I can't remember the name of the FiftyFifty beer.  It started with an M, if I remember correctly, and it was delicious.  Winner winner!  The second beer was the German Table Beer, a dark German session with wheat.  Also delicious.  I wish it hadn't been a Wednesday night because I would've picked at LEAST three more to try.  The selection is superb.  Most of my stars are dedicated to this.Food - We ordered the Snack Bar and split among us four.  I think it's a good bang for your buck.  You get a HUGE fresh soft pretzel, house made corn nuts, olives, and pork cracklins.  Everything on that platter was delicious, though I feel as though the cracklins were a little stale.  Could've just been me.  Hubs and I split the Steph Currywurst.  It's a good portion for one person.  That was my bad.  Not too overwhelming with the curry flavor, with nice pickled onions and chips on the side.  I left needing something else though....I took away a star due to price.  Yes, the selection is great.  The food is well thought-out and complementary to the beer list.  It was pricey for me though (see 1st paragraph).  A sausage dog, although delicious was $14.  Overall, still a good place.  I'd come here again on a semi-full stomach to sample more beer.
Great brunch place! Friendly service. Sat at the bar and was served by a cool guy from San Diego. A wide variety of beer on tap. The Royale with Cheese was amazing. The oysters were sweet. I will definitely return to try the pumpkin pie donut holes!
If you want a sausage and beer, this is definitely the place to be! Also, if you're a giant hipster, go here:) the quality is excellent, the vibe is trendy (in all it's dark wood and metal accents, with some great pops of corrugated metal at the bar).This place is a major thumbs up, bring your friends and it'll be a great time!
I am glad I like this place because it's literally across the street from me. Be aware it gets PACKED and it's really not the place to just drop in for a beer on the weekend. They are really particular where you sit too so aside from the bar you must check in with the host/hostess. The food is good however a bit overpriced but the pretzel is huge and very reasonably priced. But you're really coming her for the beer. The beer list is great. Let me say that again-- the beer list is great. A ton of time goes into crafting this and you can tell. Everyone working there knows a ton and will recommend and let you tastes everything first. I miss the little shuffle board they used to have but they totally needed the space given how popular Hog's has become. It's great for the neighborhood and I am a big fan.
Bacon. Pretzel. Fried chicken. Millions of local brew on tap. This man I know, who I call Lester, not his real name, of course, who is from the great state of Iowa, would have loved this place like hog in mud. My pre-race meal. It was very children friendly. I unfortunately was having a discussion with my dining partner about why men always cheat when a young couple with young children sat down. Yes it was a communal table style. So conversation of controversy could be overheard. Though I should not apologize for we have freedom of speech here and plus I know I am right. I am the confession chamber to many guy friends who cheat but feel guilty.Social commentary aside, this is kind of restaurant that serves the food for the people. Basic yet upscale. Possibly the best fried chicken with collard greens I have ever eaten. I ordered the pork shoulder with grits, delicious. Pretzel with two kinds of gourmet mustard, yum. But, the most surprising thing was the apple and celery root soup called fruit and root soup. Creamy, yes, but also very light and sweet. Very girlie dish I think. I think the sausages looked great. I want to come back to try the local brew. Very fashionable. This place felt a bit Midwestern and a bit of the South, and slightly Brooklyn. Oakland is having a moment. I sort of kind of want to share my finds with everyone. Time to make some new friends so I can show them how Oaklanders do food.
We arrived early for our reservation so sat at the bar where we enjoyed some of the amazing beers they have on tap. The service and atmosphere was so great we decided to just fine at the bar and what a treat. We had bar snacks of olives and spicy pork crackling - both delicious. Next the chickfritz which made me wish I could cook so well. For our main we shared the shrimp and grits - let's say I had to strongly resist licking the plate! Final course was the pumpkin and pretzel donuts with a custard sauce. I'll admit to drinking what was left of the custard sauce. The donuts themselves were packed with flavor and delightfully moist. Finally did I mention the beer selection? Great choice of local small brews, many of which I love so glad Hogs supports them. I will definitely be back
Wasn't impressed with the food or service,but the place looks nice. Wouldn't go back.
This area is infested with hipsters and there's nothing to complain about that. This restaurant is exactly what this area needed! Craft beer galore. This is a more intimate hipster place with cafeteria tables and a bar stools all around (they really want you to start talking to the strangers). What I lovvvvveeee is the style and the Devore of this place. The plentiful of windows and the high ceilings... It really comfortable here.They have a huge selection of craft beer all over the east Bay Area as well as out of town beers.For now I only tried their hot dogs and pretzel. The pretzel was good! Nice and soft and really big enough for two. Just AVOID dipping a huge piece into their yellow home made mustard sauce. It taste like wasabi. As for the hotdog, Jamaican Jerk Off. It was ok. The Bun broke off cause it was so soft. The sausage was good. The vegetable they added on top didn't chop off well with the bite. I mean it's a hot dog, so simple but they made it so complex that it was hard to understand why. I would come back again for the beer for sure
Went there again recently and was actually amazed by the food. Had mussels and some kind of fabulous salad and vegetable fritter thing. It was so fresh, interesting and delicious! (Yes. I licked the plate.) Sometimes it's just a matter of respecting your own culinary boundaries and finding the right thing to eat. And of course, enjoying The Hog's creative and excellent execution.
Not sure what's going on but we have been sitting here for 30 minutes! We came in and the waitress took our beer order. 10 minutes later got our beers! She never came back walked around helping all 10 people in the restaurant. Trying to flag her down no eye contact smh. Well at least my dead canary is good. oh boy she walked by again!! Check please I guess we can't try the food. Let me change it to one star even ride when asking for the check!!
I came here during restaurant week and it was pretty busy. The service was great and the food was okay.
Excellent beer selection Slowish service, only had maybe 1 or 2 waitstaff for a  busy Saturday night. I was going to order the corn app but thankfully I was told it was essentially corn nuts.Pistachio mortadella was goodPork  crackling was deliciousShrimp grits were absolutely fantasticCorn dog was extremely dissapointing, the breading fell apart and wasn't crispy or thick enough and the sausage was bleh.
Sorry, but don't believe the hype. Although Hog's is a guiding light for the Temescal gentrification movement, the service is kind of pretentious dudes old timey haircuts and ironic t-shirts, the food is meh, and the vibe is kind of wack. Thanks for the $7.50 beer and microwaved pretzel. Wah-wahhhhhh.
You know, I found the menu very hard to navigate. Maybe I went at the wrong time of the day? But we were only offered a bar menu and it was not straight forward. I felt almost intimidated trying to figure out why we had to de-code it. We had to ask the waitress a few times what is what and how we get what we want. She seemed at awe why we would ask suchhhh questions but then she served us marinated olives from a MASON jar. That was when I figured out we were going to be spending money on cool instead of food, so we nibbled and left. I may or may not stick my head in another time, just to see if their regular dinner menu will not be served on burlap or a birds nest. The restaurant itself is very pretty though!
I went here with two of my friends for Oakland Restaurant Week; unfortunately, we came at dinner and the offer was not available! Bummer! You walk in, and there is a bar, benches (Biergarten status), and stools around the edges. The decor was nice and even featured a giant hog. FOOD: We got the meatball appetizer and I got the Extras sandwich. My friends got the Area 51 and the Kielbasa. Overall, tasty. The food comes with freshly made chips and pickled vegetables. The chips were HEAVILY salted that I felt that it was just not good. Please hold back on the salt. Veggies were fine. The sausage combo itself was pretty good. DRINK:I got a double IPA. The place has a lot of beer options and are constantly rotating with choices, so beer options are great here. SERVICE: I was pleased with the service. Our waitress was attentive, but nothing spectacular, but our food and drinks come out in within a reasonable amount of time. Although, she took away our full water pitcher and gave it to another party. I was confused, but mistakes like that happen. OVERALL:To sum it up, very expensive, which probably is why it's 3 stars. For what I ate, the quality, and all, I don't see how I can justify $14 for a "sandwich" (a hot dog). We were content with the place at the end of the night, but believed the price and quality disparity was too big.
...I changed my mind. (after my last visit)Smarmy host. Over priced food. Yacky, pretentious &amp; droning hipster wannabes. It's downright annoying. I'm not going back. 'tis a shame. Nice bartender. Great beer selection.  ...oh well.
Great place to get a drink, and the food (at least, our pretzels) is great! They have a large variety of beers. I had the red flight, everyone else had lighter beers. The beer and the pretzels were all amazing!
Quick stop for a snack before heading out to a late dinner. The beer selections were pretty impressive! Decided to try the Hock &amp; Trotter Terrine - could use a bit of seasoning. The flavors didn't mix in together as well as we expected it to. Still overall satisfying.
Despite passing by this place several times on my trek to Piedmont, I had never set foot in The Hog's Apothecary until this evening. I had always felt a tad bit put off by the name, as I am a strict vee-gan. Their menu didn't seem to be very veg-friendly (rather, not at all). However, my friend Lindsey (also a veg) brought me here, and I thought it was pretty neat, as far as bars go. I tried the Societe beer flight this evening ($10), which featured tantalizing names for each brew: The Harlot, The Debutante, and The Widow. All three of the beers hailed from San Diego. The service was a touch unfriendly, but I've come to expect that same surliness with hipster locales in the East Bay. The dining area and bar were both pretty jam-packed, so the host placed us, standing, at a counter by the window. The server seemed to dislike this placement, but where else were we to go? I think I would have bumped this one up to a 5 if the staff had took initiative and found us a table.. Even so, at the end of the day, all of the beers I tasted were delicious, and I would definitely return to sample more of their cold beverages.
The ambiance here is really nice. The beer is delicious and food is amazing. The pretzels with wasabi mustard sauce really opens your airway and taste so good.
Been here for lunch and dinner now and it's been great!  The menu is limited but with enough choices and diversity for everyone to be able to find something.  Extensive beer menu but I dont think liquor.  Seating is communal on some tables to be ready to rub elbows with a stranger.  Looking forward to going back as they update their menu.
Loudest restaurant I've ever been in making the experience uncomfortable right as it began.  The cracklins were chewy, not really crunchy, and didn't have any pork flavor to it.  The terrine was too subtle and came on bread which tasted like it was a day old.  My Versace sausage was one of the better ones I've had, well seasoned and juicy with a good kick, served on a soft bun which tasted kind of like a Hawaiian roll. The potato chips were fine but nothing special, reminds me of in-n-out fries which are "more fresh" but also just don't taste as good as other stuff you find.Overall a pretty average meal in an unpleasant setting.
Wow! Literally the best benedict I ever had, and from a gastropub no less.  The meat was amazing and the egg was perfectly poached.  Excellent job! And I'm typically someone who is very particular with it comes to breakfast (I have a sous vide at home so it's hard to beat sous vide eggs).  Plus great beer selection on top of that!
Had a nice lunch here with a mimosa and a "Vietnamese" sausage sandwich with an egg on it. quite good. You sit at communal tables. Maybe next time we come here for happy hour.
We came back for dinner to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (dropped in without a reservation) and in almost no time at all, we were seated in the exact same place as our first visit back in July. We had the same server, AND she remembered us! Pretty awesome. The blue cheese stuffed figs are not on the menu currently but they make some damn good steak (with blue cheese BUTTER!!! WOWWWW) and fries. I loved looking around the restaurant while we were eating and seeing how the staff all interacted with each other - laughing, talking, and at one point I looked up in time to see someone down half a glass of beer. I don't mean to imply they're unprofessional; rather I get the impression that people that work here love being around each other and working together in an environment that they enjoy, which definitely makes for a fun dining experience. If we lived closer (and made a bit more money) I'd want to be regulars.Seriously guys, if you're ever in the area, skip the crowds waiting outside Homeroom (although I also love that place) and just go about a block up for some of the best dishes in the east bay.
Brunched here twice and the food has been delectable:Softshell crab Benedict - I snapped that up the moment I saw it, and so glad I did because it wasn't on the menu the next time I went here!  It was just as good I imagined it would be, plus the potatoes on the side were amazing.Savory waffle + fried chicken - I had this with both gravy and syrup, and really it should be done no other way.  The fried chicken was boneless (all the easier to inhale you with, my dear), moist on the inside, crunchy but not greasy on the outside.  The waffles were cornmeal-y, also with the perfect amount of crispness most becoming of a waffle.  Have this dipped in syrup, and then the next bite smeared with gravy, then a bite of chicken, and so forth.  I can guarantee the couple next to you who hasn't gotten their entrees yet will be slightly uncomfortable at you and your spouse's eating moans.  Service was great.  I would say in the summer be prepared for a cold drink along with everything else.
Waltzed in here with a reservation for 2, just in case, on a Sunday morning for brunch. Upon first observation, this place is bright, open and cute!! Community tables for the social people and a few private tables for people like me. My friend opted for the Pastrami Benedict with Schmaltz Potatoes and I went for the Fried Chicken and Spring Onion Waffles with Huckleberry Jam. Let's not forget the mimosas, a brunch requirement. Delicious. That is all I have to say. Hands down best chicken and waffles I've had so far... And I've had a lot. No bones! I'm all about bones and meat handles but you know there be places that give you only skin and bones. Just meat baby. Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy on the inside. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And those schmaltzy potatoes?! I stole them off my friends plate... So damn good. That flavor! I can't get over this place!
This is one of our go-to brunch spots in the Bay Area. The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is great and we love the space with beautiful light big community tables. Some of our favorites include the French Madame, the schmaltzy potatoes, the Royale with cheese. The staff is always friendly, great customer service.
Hipster is probably the best way to describe this place. The concept, the staff, the menu. This is something that you would expect in Portland - but none of this is necessarily a bad thing.My friend up in Oakland had reached out to me, and while looking at reviews for the Trappist, a mention about the Hog's Apothecary caught my eye. Fortunately the place was a few blocks from my friend and close to my sister. My friend has wanted to try this place, and I was curious.We showed up to standing room only - a good sign. My friend put her name down with a 30 minute wait, and we found a space to look over the beer menu. Really impressive, local menu. Some things I've tried, but there was plenty that I had never even seen before. Started with the 1903 Pre-Prohibition Style American Lager, which was delicious, and intelligently the beers got added to the menu tab for when we sat.Not even 10 minutes later we got a seat. Other than the bar, the place features long tables with benches. Herein lies the one of problem I see with this place: getting in and up from these benches if you have a middle seat and they are already packed. I eventually maneuvered in, but it wasn't easy.The possibly daily-changing menu was confusing to say the least. I still have no idea what Arlo Shirks or Olin Browns are. I get it, hipster. But don't make things difficult on your servers and the patrons - call shit out, like everything else on the menu.Regardless, I went the sausage sandwich route that the person sitting next to me also did: a Darkwing (duck and pork sausage with some kind of delicious greens on top) and the fried grits side. The Darkwing was delicious and hearty, the chips very flavorful, as were the white veggie side. The fried grits were also delicious, but the sausage was big enough that I barely got a dent into the grits.Before leaving my friend and I each ordered one of the daily flights: she went with wheat, I went with hoppy. The Daphne was delicious, but definitely more on the crisp summer day variety of hoppy.I could definitely see coming back, and if I lived in the area, the beers alone might make this a recurring stop. Some of the entrees are a bit on the pricey side, but fortunately there are some cheap options so you don't break the bank.
Great food and rotating taps.  The staff is also wonderful.  I visit often and love their brunch!
A certain someone wanted to try this place for over 4 months now...Here we are at this place with all the open space in the world, but to only see two communal tables in the middle of the room and bar stools along the window counters.  Trying to squeezed us into the edge of the communal table (H-E-L-L to the NO!). We opted to wait for the bar stools instead.With minimal selections, we nibble on some chickpea fritters and meatballs before scarfing down our Moroccan lambs sandwich and hot dogs. Nothing spectacular about the food when all you're given was some pickles and potato chips to go along with your meal.  I'm not looking to return to this place but maybe one day along the line. In fairness, their service was on point and friendly.
Solid food, great atmosphere and interesting beer list. The pretzel is a must. Sausages are good. Fried chicken is good. Totally worth while. Though I dig it it's not a place that's like a total package for me meaning I would suggest it, but I wouldn't go outta my way to go there. It is for sure one of the better spots in that few block radius - not that there are many.
Went "cheap" with the Corn Dog ($8) and asked for a recommendation for the 3 small Charcuterie items. The waitress recommended the Pork Terrine ($6).The terrine comes with toasted slices of Barkada baguette, whole grain mustard, pickle, and olive (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). Despite having visible herbs it was pretty bland on it's own and definitely needed the mustard (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…).The Corn Dog was superb. It's huge and served with lard-y chips, pickles, ketchup and yellow mustard (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). Strong smokey flavor from the hot dog. The chips were all crisp, an improvement from my last visit.They need to beef up the little skewer you can see on the left side of my picture. I first picked the corn dog up with that and it immediately bent and cracked under the weight of the corn dog.
Went to check this place out. Food was okay but service was bad.Duck was dry. Nothing special about the fried chicken. Meatballs were great!!But our server, maybe she was having a bad day, but really inattentive.  She never came and checked in if I wanted another beer. When taking our order she literally left before my friend placed his order. She took my order then turned around and left as he was about to place his order. He had to track her down and give her his order. And she never returned to check how our meals were. It became comical but she was not a good server. I wasn't impressed enough to return. Think it's a lot of hype.
Here's the thing: the food is sadly only 2-2 and a half stars, but the excellent service bumps it up to three stars. 1) the fried chicken was covered in gravy. Like too much and took away from the crispness. No flavor to the batter really and kinda bland. Meh. 2) the corn dog- gf got it and I tried. Also just not as good as it looked. 3) fried pickle appetizers were solid though. 4) great beer selection I will confirm.
I was sooo excited to try HA...I'm so disappointed that our experience left us irritated &amp; disgusted. There was literally 4 other patrons there when we walked in at 5:25pm...at 5:30 dinner started &amp; 5 more parties walked in....we got outta there at 6pm with NO food order since EVERYONE got service before we did. I was appalled no one even stopped by to check how we were doing with our beer that was ordered at the bar.  Funny enough there was a black guy at the bar that was there before we got there that no one was checking on either!!!! The food smelled so good but they weren't getting another cent from me....they went outta their way to avoid making eye contact.  Make sure you look hipster enough if you want any service from Hog's....you just messed with the wrong ONE!
Super yummi y'all! Best fired chicken I ever had (albeit probably the smallest portion). Their Wiener schnitzel was incredible and I'll be back.
This place has an incredible beer list. The beer selector knows their stuff. Always delicious. I live fairly close to this spot so I frequent this place. Hogs does not have anything I eat ( because I'm vegan) but the service, ant the staff are great, so I come anyways. My man loves their sausages and I just like the place. Good beer and great staff and I like the design of the place.
Was looking forward to trying this place as I like beer and pork, and it's within walking distance to my home.  Came with a small  group on a very quiet night (maybe 6 or 7 customers besides us), but was underwhelmed. Had a good beer and intended to eat, but was put off by the service. Example: When I asked the guy behind the bar if a certain beer was good, rather than a friendly "Yes", and maybe describing it, he just dryly said "Define good".  Really? You're gonna just throw it back at the customer with two words to prove how cool and indifferent you are?More than one examples of dickish attitude meant we left after one beer each, and a tab that was less than 1/5 of what was likely as we intended to stay for more beers and dinner, but I guess they "won" because they seemed intent on not making us feel welcome and they achieved it.In the Yelp listing, it says "Ambience: Hipster" and that's accurate.  Judging from the snarky/snotty service, it seems they Hog's Apothecary thinks that's a compliment. In my experience, even hipsters don't like to think of themselves as such. (Are there really people out there who say, "Hipster? I'm there!")This place needs to get over itself and act like they're happy you're there.  The fact that they don't bother to respond to their Yelp reviews seems to be another example of them thinking they're too cool to care.
When you see the word "apothecary" in their name, you just know it's gonna be hipster.  So much so, that I kept feeling like I was in a Portland joint.  Maybe it was the drizzle outside, maybe the multiple sightings of flannels and beards, whatever it may be, I was down with it.  This place is simple yet legit.  A new American Beer Hall is how they deem themselves and I like it.Started with a black beer mixed with pinot noir from Moonlight in Santa Rosa and it was super unique.  Not bad but not something I would want multiples of.  You can definitely taste the wine.  Noshed on their bar ready *spicy* pork cracklings and they were incredibly light and sticky on the tooth.  And spicy was a bit of an understatement, it stung like a mutha.  I suppose they want you to order another beer.A salad of tender butter lettuce, chopped beets, hipster rainbow radishes and a nice blue cheese dressing is a nice starter.  At $10 it is quite spittable.Zsa Zsa $14 is an amazing sausage sandwich.  A Hungarian style which is like a kielbasa on steroids.  Don't know if they make their own sausage but this was one helluva meat specimen in tube form.  It was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Unique toasted bread, a fresh herb/oil spread and thick cut potato chips. Oh I'd grow a hipster beard for this if I could, but I can't, so darn it to hell.Hanger Steak $26 was spot on bistro fare.  Tender bloody meat, blue cheese sauce, sautéed greens and potato gratin.  Very assertive flavors and if you love beef, this will not disappoint.  Only thing was it came out lukewarm and within a minute it was basically cold.  But now with a dry hopped steam beer from Petaluma, all was good.Like the hood, like the brews, like the staff and like the food.  What's not to like?!  This place is a total score.
I am adding an update because I received a note from one of the other bartenders that I have never experienced and he told me to come back when he was working and apologized for the bad experience I had.I stopped in late for an after climbing beer and saw that he was behind the bar so I went in. I ordered a delicious beer, drank my beer and went on my way.I was impressed and very pleased by his service and have gone back twice when I see he is working. He is definitely the gem of that place and like going in for a late night beer when he is working!
The beer selection is excellent.  The food, unfortunately, is mediocre and overpriced.  I'd be there more often if the waiters weren't so snotty and on top of you.  They'll get very pissy if you don't order food, even if it's early evening and the place is barely half full.
I want to love this place. I live a block away away and I want to come, all the time, and to love it. However, due to the poor service I've received on more than one occasion and the clear lack of vegetarian/vegan options I feel forced to give a less than satisfactory review. I'm usually fine with ordering the hot pretzel, which to be fair is awesome, and having one (or two or three) of the amazing beers available, and call it an excellent night. However, on more than one occasion, I've experienced snobby and/or snarky service, which I find quite uncool (I've worked in customer service for over 20 years and know what it's like to give and receive genuinely warm, welcoming, and helpful service).I'll start with the good-often times I've had great servers who were attentive, polite, and top-notch. I've had numerous fantastic beers and beer suggestions and a handful of excellent salads and desserts. However, more than once I've come across employees who were were way less than helpful, and at times, snarky. Boo.Me on a Friday night around 6pm: "Hi, I'd love to grab a quick drink"Hostess (with warmth of of a rock): "There's no room at the bar."Me: "Oh, see there's a spot by the window, can I take that [which they let me have any other night of the week]?"Hostess: "Some people are waiting for those."Ok, I can't have a quick beer in the meantime? You can't say in a friendly tone, 'you're welcome to wait until something opens up...?'Frustrated, I left and decided to go across town where I felt more welcome. I drove by about 15 minutes later (on my way to said place a cross town), and there was still no one in the seat I had asked for (I could see from the huge windows) Glad you keep it for them! (I would have been done, paid, and and out of the seat by then).My next experience: on a Sunday night in which I sit at the bar then ask the bartender if any of the sides are vegetarian. His reply: "Have you seen the name of this place? We can always make you a vegetarian plate if you wish..." Thanks, but why the need for a snarky opening? I could reply, and did: you are a business in vey hipster neighborhood full of vegans and vegetarians. It's unfortunate that you're not more friendly to those diets. He has the audacity to debate with me, which is when I start writing this review.On a positive note, when I'm done with my beer the seemingly manager apologizes for any negativity and offers to pay for me beer. Thanks buddy! You've kept the door open for another chance.Give 'en a try if you're there for a full, non-vegetarian dinner. You may really like it! And, if they shape up a bit and tune in to their local clientele and the general requests of their customers, I'll be back on a regular basis.
Great service and awesome food. Have to admit that I was a bit weary going here with all the reviews about too cool for school hipster servers and I am happy to report that hipster is the only true adjective.We were a group of five plus one baby and they were very accomodating, making sure that we had the right spot where the kiddo wouldn't be knocked over.Food was delicious. We scarfed down the soft pretzels.  Fried chicken was good but not amazing. True to the name, anything with a casing is worth ordering and order one of everything!
I think the food is outstanding.  I have been known to be a less than adventurous eater so i must point out that everything I have had has had me in awe.  Love love the always rotating, fresh craft brew selection and they have a couple wines that are de-lish as well as a sparkling for those not into beer.I must comment on the 2 star review:  You went to an establishment practically named "pork incorporated" and were surprised at the lack of vegetarian options?  And they preceded to tell you they are always happy to make a vegetarian friendly dish on order (I've overheard them offer this to people and thought that was very accommodating!) and you are still less than thrilled with their service?  And if the local clientele is not being represented with such an establishment, then why are they packed regularly and why did another butchery restaurant open just up the block?
Finally had a chance to try this place out as I don't live in the area. What a gem! We tried several items on the menu and all to a dish were superbly thought out, created, plated and delicious.  My favorite by far was the charcuterie ... all made in house of course.Beyond the food, the beer list is extensive and eclectic.  From what the owners said, constantly rotating as well so I'd encourage frequent visits to sample them all of course. They also work directly with breweries rather than through distributors when possible so you know care is taken regarding freshness. If I lived closer, I'd own a "mug".And the atmosphere! Warm. Inviting. Family friendly. Not too loud but still fun and great for groups.  The staff was very service oriented and the chef/owner is constantly circulating the room and ensuring everyone has a fantastic experience.
The rapini here is arugalized in-house, and their delicious pea tendrils are wilted to order. Don't forget to slather the Yemeni skhug on your quatre epices for that extra kick of flavor.Tl;dr: the menu is unrelentingly pretentious, and using inductive reasoning, my party determined all hot dogs are indistinguishable from one another.
The Hog's . . . .is a nice addition to the flourishing Beer Garden trend that is finally catching up to the rest of the USA.  Yet this one the lacks the actual outdoor experience one would expect of a traditional Beer Garden.  Nevertheless, there are many things to like about this one.  Well, of course the beer selections are very satisfactory ranging from imports and domestics on tap.  The food delights wells especially the Terrines or the Hogs Head Cheese and and the Charcuteries.  Nothing too extraordinary here, but the mains and started complement the beer selection nicely.  However, avoid the mostly unsparing sides like the Brussels sprouts,  etc.  More time was put into describing them than preparing them, so theylive on this menu as an afterthought.  The atmosphere is rustic, modern and pleasing ,but it hard to have a conversation here at the larger tables where you nearly have to yell to be hard.  So if you want something quieter and more chatty, sit by the windows.
Good food, great service, but this place is so incredibly overpriced.  $27 for two tiny pieces of fried chicken.  $16 for a tiny salad?  Totally ridiculous.  But delicious.
I'm from San Diego and this is my second visit to the Hog.  Both times I have had an exceptional time!!  The customer service and beer selection are outstanding.  The first time I was there Nicole took great care of this out-of-towner and I knew I had to go back.  Megan in the bar was super awesome and she really knew her beer.  She paired me up with a great beer that I probably couldn't have picked of myself.  After that, Marie, Alice and Christy took over and things were consistently great from there.  The rainbow heirloom was too good to describe in words, so you might want to go down there in person and try it for yourself.  Every time I'm in Oakland Im stopping by for sure.  Thanks for the extra Burrata guys!!  Keep up the good work!!
Returned for breakfast and was thrilled to see the Benedict back on the menu, this time with pastrami. Combined with the schmaltzy potatoes it is just amazing. And as previously mentioned the iced coffee is delicious, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ.
service was ridiculously slow! I swear there was one.. MAYBE two people working and the place was packed! I had the corn dog and I like mustard but that stuff was gross, wayy to spicyoverall just not my kind of restaurant i would recommend going just for a beer due to the large selection but the service would keep from going even for that.
This is my friend's favorite spot so we've eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks and a dozen, or more, times over the last 4 months.  The host and servers are always helpful, knowledgable and accommodating.  They make most everything in house, so they can tell you about all of the ingredients.   This has been super helpful over the last few weeks because I'm doing the Whole30 diet that requires I not partake in a whole host of ingredients (including no added sugar to anything).  I've had the same super awesome server the last 3 times.  She knows what I need and has been incredibly accommodating and helpful in working with the kitchen to help me eat there. My friend enjoys trying different beers and every server we've had has happily help him choose the best bear to go with his meal.  I'm don't drinker beer but they've even helped me find one or two that I like (before I was doing the Whole30).If you're looking for friendly service, good solid food and a great beer selection this is a place you should try.
Beer selection can't be beat, and a knowledgeable staff to guide you thru it.  Menu is meat heavy as expected, and isn't approachable for everyone.  However the flavors are incredible and every meal I've had there has been delicious.  Great location for MacArthur BART and I'll be back soon.
The food is amazing. Large hearty portions, really tasty and comforting. Great selection of beer. The service however has room for improvement - can never seem to catch the eye of the one server on the floor at 7pm on a Sunday (who whisked away our water bottle in an attempt to refill it, then forgot to return it until we flagged her down to ask about the bottle's whereabouts). The squirrely host is no help either - eyes only looking at the silverware he was setting down.
Have now been to Hog's 3 times, and I have been beyond impressed every time. My fancy beer friends are always stoked with the selection of beers on tap. Being more of a wine girl, I really like that selection is as well. Food was DELISH! The summer gems salad was fresh and tasty time. The heirloom tomatoes were also super tasty, and the Italian Sausage KILLED IT. Go to Hogs, go now.
Got there for a reservation at 7:30 pm were seated at 8:20pCouldn't hear or think beyond the noise and music.Fish dish was dry  and bland
Man, this place is awesome!! I came here for the first time a couple days ago and just had to go back last night. I found out about the Hog when I decided to Yelp for corn dog places around the bay. When this place popped up, I bookmarked it and knew that this place was going to be a winner (have you SEEN the pictures of that sucker?!). Located on the corner of Shafter and 40th about a block away from Homeroom, this place is a great location for a quick dinner or to catch up with some friends. During the visits, my girlfriend and I got to try their kielbasa ("Who's your Basa?"), corn dog, roasted peppers, and delicious as all-hell potato chips (that are fried in their own pig lard! Yes!!). The Hog has a hefty beer collection on tap with relatively lesser-known breweries. We met up with a friend and all got to try an IPA with wild rice, imperial IPA, several saisons and a couple of stouts. I don't recall the exact number of beers that they have on tap, but it's a very impressive number considering some places in the area only serve up about 10.If you're coming here for dinner, make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to just sit at the bar, which really isn't bad. The music here is BITCHIN, so prepare to eat good food, drink tasty beer, and groove to some dope music.
Look, I know that as a vegetarian in a place called "Hog's Apothecary" (or "Hog's" anything else for that matter), I have little right to complain about a lack of food options not made from a pig.  So I'll only note here that if you are a vegetarian (or keep Kosher or Halal), you are not going to find food here for you.We only came here for beer anyway, so I'm not holding it against them.The ambiance here is cool-- very Oakland hip.  Lots of beer options, so, there's that.  Greeter and server and person who finally brought our beers were very nice.But I was not that impressed with the beer we had in 2 different flights (so that's 6 different beers--multiple opportunities for good beer), and it took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order once we had sat down.  We actually gave up we were sitting there so long and finally just went to the bar to order there.  The place isn't that big and didn't have that many people, but it seems like they didn't have enough servers for the space, and so our nice server lady badly neglected us.  It's two stars for me on this not because it's a bad place in and of itself but because for Oakland, it's a definite "Meh. I've experienced better."  It definitely did not live up to the hype; neither, for me, did it live up to comparisons/experiences/and-mainly-the-beer of Beer Revolution or The Trappist.But I'm going to guess that if you like pork with random potentially-not-great-beer that this place is going to be the bee's knees for you.  Or the pork knees, as it were.
If you are a beer lover and find yourself in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in here. The extensive (mostly local) draft beer list is impressive and is varied enough to keep the whole group happy. Our group of 4 started standing by the window while we waited for some seating to open up. We then sat at one of the large shared tables in the middle of the restaurant, where we shared a couple bits/starters and two of the house sausages (which are huge). Great/lively ambiance!
Sorry guys! Have always loved the food and amazing draft list but... Chill out on the rules. The last three times we've been there our experience has been soured by weird overstepping of bar/seating arrangements. I've invited multiple guests who've felt snubbed by this. I.e. tonight for my birthday after work our table was approached and I was told we were expected to spend more money on food not just drinks and would have been sat somewhere different. This was an odd and somewhat rude admission in light of each person ordering over $30 in drinks. I appreciate the attempt to keep the most efficient flow going through the restaurant but the second your patrons feel like pigs led through a feeding trough, you've lost an opportunity.
I don't drink beer often but I had a fun time experimenting with the beer menu and having our waitress pick out drinks for me based on my preferences.  The Harlot (a Belgian pale ale) was my favorite, and given that I overheard a few other parties ordering it, my sense is that it's a pretty popular choice.I enjoyed everything we ordered (pork cracklins, meatballs, summer bean ragout and mixed grill) except for the corn dog.  The hot dog tasted overly smokey and burnt to the point where I couldn't really taste the cornbread.  This was highly disappointing because I love corn dogs, but I still recommend coming here for the other dishes, beer selection and attentive service.
After a rocky first visit (nothing to do with the food), I'm now a HUGE HOG FAN. The cod fritters were delicious. The fried chicken rocked our world. Service was charming and I really appreciated the owners reaching out. They've totally solved any service problem they had.
Food:Spicy Pork Cracklin's - Don't get it, it's not very good.  It doesn't taste like "real" cracklins.Belgian-Braised Pork Shoulder - This is a winner.  For $27, you make the value proposition on this one.Choucroute Garnie - It's exactly what it is albeit I was expecting more meat.  I think there were 4 meat selections and more saurkraut.  A great plus is that one of the meats is their duck, which is DELISH!  If I compare it to others that I've tried, this lands on the bottom somewhere (That just means I've experienced tons of kick-ass Choucroute Garnie in my life).Beer:Yeast and Hops Flights - All good.  This place has a great selection of beers and if they curate it as they described, extra kudos.Lowdown:I'll probably go back for the beer and the ambiance.  The food and area, not so much.  I would be here often if I lived in the neighborhood, that's how much I liked my experience.  Some people will say that the food is over-priced, I can see that argument.Recommendation:MAKE A RESERVATION
Love the ambience annnnd it's in my 'hood. I'm going in a hike tomorrow so I wanted something hefty even though I am currently sans meat. So I ordered the Gem &amp; Jewels salad along with the Soft Pretzel. Sooooooo good. Omg, this salad. For reals. Not playing. The softness of gem lettuce, the sweetness of the persimmon, the tang of the pomegranate cut with the slight acidic tang of the crème fraiche dressing... but y'all don't hear me though. I'm sure many have waxed poetic about the pretzel so I'll just say, order it. Their beer menu is extensive and the staff is very welcoming.
I ordered one of the sausage combos and it was awesome. The sausage was made and cooked perfectly, and the fixings, while not terribly appetizing to look at, were perfect along with the bun. The beer selection is great and I can always find something new to try. Despite being busy, service was quick on everything and the manager was also helping out and very responsive.
I love this place. Their detail to their house made food,  fine local beers and wine is amazing. The corn dog is the best you'll ever have. It gets busy and some might say somewhat pricey, but well worth all of it! I've been here several times since they've opened and am always impressed. Thank goodness for fine food in Oakland!PS- they just started doing take-out; I cannot wait to eat a corn dog in bed. Yum.
This is a cool hipster place - love the vibe here.  If you like beer, it is a must.  I am not a drinker but friends enjoyed it here.  The hostess was very friendly to the wait staff.  This is a place to share food and chat with friends.  It does get kinda loud in here and you need to raise your voice to talk at times.  The food is good..we shared 2 sampler appetizer plate and an entree.  It was a good taste of all kinds of pork.  The portions were good..not too small and too overly large..good size.  The prices are decent.  It is nice to have a gastropub in temescal area.  With home run down the block and blue bottle opening near by, I am glad this neighborhood is up and coming with great eats.
This is an awesome place for beer lovers - they just have an amazing selection of local beers on tap. They also have a selection of ciders, which I tend to order. Usually you can grab a seat at the communal tables, but you can also make reservations if you have a bigger party. I've found the food to be a little disappointing, with very few options for vegetarians be warned!
If you are driving to the neighborhood, do NOT leave anything in your car. No bags, no cell phone chargers.  Your car WILL be broken into, and you will not get your stuff back.
Okay, I swear, it took me a while to choose between 3 or 4 stars - I've seriously been going back and forth for about 5 minutes now! We ordered the mixed grill - I believe it was a mix of 3 different meats (a piece of sausage, pork belly/thickest bacon slab I ever seeeen) and a half of a small tiny bird (I think Cornish game hen??)...anyways! 'twas delicious and utterly satisfying. Full of flavor and goes so gooood with the beer!OH YEAH...the beer. that's a whole separate story guys. this place has a FAT list of brewery-direct beers on tap. they are hand-selected and have a variety from all over the west coast. In addition, they're pretty knowledgeable on the beers they offer, so when in doubt, just ask for a suggestion. Now...the reason I gave 3 stars...the pricing. I mean...really, for a small ramekin of basically what we Americans know as "Corn Nuts" you're gonna charge $3 for less than a handful? AND...they're way too hard to chew, they might be better off sticking in a sling-shot and letting a kid have some fun. $6 for a regular pretzel. The plate we got, Mixed Grill...small tiny portions...was wrong for 2 of us to share, but THAT small plate was $28 :/  yikes...Another reason for not giving 4 stars was the attitude of the staff - mostly the hostess, the guys at the tap, and our specific server....so I guess that's the majority. they had this attitude that came off as if they were "too cool" or "too hipster" to help out and serve normal people coming from work that just want a good bite and beer. definitely felt like they're only welcoming to a certain and specific type of crowd...guess you need tats, an old leather jacket and a septum piercing to get the thumbs up for them. it's a shame, because I would've gone back for their food and beer selection...probably on a pay day since its kinda pricey , HAH!
Went by again for an early dinner on Sunday. No wait right at 5pm, but it seemed to get crowded around 5:45pm.This time we had a chance to sample more of the menu and I have to say that I was actually really surprised at how good the food was! I was prepared to support this place based on the fact that it serves good beer and is within walking distance of where I live, but now I can legit say it is worth seeking out.We had:- charcuterie sampler of pork rillettes, liver mousse, trotter terrine ($13 for the sampler of three). Quality: B+, Adesso is way better. Quantity: B, too much of the sides, not quite enough of the main bits, but for $13, it was alright- frisee and arugula salad with grilled peaches and humboldt fog toast ($8 I think?). Quality: A+, this was perfectly balanced and well-seasoned and the peaches were ripe and sweet. Quantity: B, the toast was kinda ridiculously thinly spread with cheese- rabbit &amp; pork belly salad with onion stuff and herb stuff on it, it came with chips and pickles ($14). Quality: A+++++ the sausage was incredible. I was really blown away by how good it was. Served on a nice soft roll that seemed a bit pretzel-like. I've eaten at Rosamunde countless times and I have to say, this sausage blows theirs out of the park. Seems like maybe they've addressed the "okra slime" issue for the pickled veggie side because I saw no okra and no slime. Quantity: B+ the sausage was decently sized but still for the price... B+- side of cheddar grits ($6) Quality: A+ hi I love butter cream and cheese. yummmmmm Quantity: B. come on. it's grits. you could give us more than 1.25 cups for $6.
I've been here three times. Loved it the first two, really disliked it the last.  They've changed the menu: they used to have a great salad ("visions of spring") which still shows up on their online menu but was no longer on offer last Saturday.  The salad I had (which was basically the only option) called the "green machine" was a salty, gloppy mess.  And worst of all, they "ran out" of the soft pretzels, which was 90 percent of our reason for being there. At 8 p.m. on a Saturday night - really??? Our less than helpful server offered us nothing as substitute (some of the potato chips that came with the dinner the people next to us had would have been good to satisfy the salty craving, but we didn't know about them).  And our platter of three different salumi only had two.  I guess they "ran out" of the third variety.  Finally, our "medium rare" ribeye was raw: presumably they "ran out" of time to cook it properly.
We love Hog's Apothecary- relaxed local vibe- great beer and cider selection - I LOVE the Graviva personally - their albeit more limited wine selection works even with their focus on draft and craft beer- food is sophisticated, interesting and the menu is always changing- service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable - they now have added brunch which is awesome :)- to date we have always been able to walk in and get seated - we make reservations about 50% of the time as it can get busy for dinner even early in the dining hour
The beer selection is great and fairly priced but the food selection is not. Well developed flavor with tragically pretentious ingredients. It is exactly what you should expect from a hipster joint in piedmont, $23 for a pork chop. The meatballs were the best thing on the table. Bring your horn rimmed glasses.
Great beer. The staff is very knowledgeable and all I need to tell them is a type of beer I like and they find the perfect match for me.  Love this place. I have not tried the food yet.
I tried Hog's Apothecary for the second time.  The food is very good but the service just horrible.  I arrive famished on Sunday.  Ordered the Clubber.  Food arrived about 30 minutes later and the waitress once again quickly disappeared after dropping off the food.   No apology or acknowledgment on the long time to deliver the food.  No, "Can I get you anything else?"  No follow up with, "Is everything ok?"   Poof - gone.  She delivered the wrong sandwich to me, though my partner's was correct.  Horrible.  It's such a shame since the food and beer is pretty good here, but not good enough to overshadow the down right poor, indifferent service.  Sorry, not going back.
When going to the restaurant of a friend for the first time, one prepares themselves to be polite, offering words of praise out of the sense of duty that comes with being friends.  We caution ourselves not to be harsh or critical and generally keep any negatives quiet.  After all, they are our friends and we'd expect the same.Thank goodness I don't have to keep the negatives to myself...  as I couldn't find any.  In fact, to say I was impressed would be an understatement.Brad and John have taken what once was a dilapidated laundromat with a seedy past and created a neighborhood gathering spot that is open, airy and inviting.  I was at first slightly put off by the long tables and benches, as I generally prefer not to share my table with people I don't know, but I came to realize that it promotes conversation between strangers and contributes to the neighborhood feel.  While the dining area is not huge, the high ceiling with exposed beams and open air skylight make it feel much larger.  "Hog's" boasts more taps than I could get through in a week.  They have beers on tap to appeal to any beer drinker.  They also cycle beers in and out to keep the selections new and inviting.  Now.. on to the food itself.  We started out with the warm pretzel for two with cheese sauce and mustard. ( One thing you must know before I go further.  Nearly everything you eat is made in house.  The mustard, the cheese, the sausage, the kraut...  the exceptions being the buns and, if memory serves, the pretzel itself. )  The pretzel was hot and delicious.  The house made mustard and cheese sauce were the perfect compliment.  There's just no comparison between jar mustard and mustard made fresh that day.  For my entree I ordered the schnitzel.  It's really easy to overcook pork and make it dry.  Not the case here.  The breading was light, the pork juicy and while I used my knife at first, I ended up using just my fork as it was so tender.  The arugula and warm potato salad only served to enhance the succulent pork.  My dining companions ordered the 'Basa' with kraut and the Devil Bird fried chicken.  I was raised by a German mother who made ( and at 70 still makes ) her own kraut. As much as I cannot believe I am saying this, ( Sorry, Mom ) the kraut at Hog's is better...  especially thrown on top of a juicy and savory sausage with just the right pop from the casing.  ( Sorry, Mom ) The chicken was juicy and full of flavor, but it's the breading that really takes it over the top.  It's hard to describe, but there's a slight sweetness to it that, to me, was reminiscent of that first bite of a churro or a Krispy Kreme that immediately makes you want another bite.  It's difficult NOT to want to clean your plate.I do have one regret.  Only one.  I didn't try dessert.  We all surveyed the dessert menu, but after a great beer and amazing food there was just no room.I know I am a friend and friends tend to be biased so I encourage you to read other reviews.  Aside from the small contingent of nay-sayers you will find that the overall rating of 4/5 stars is well earned and well deserved.  It's worth checking out.
A little spendy for what you get, but everything we had was great and the atmosphere and service was wonderful.
We've visited Hog's a few times now.  Every single time, we've received amazing food and exceptional service.  We've left with happy bellies and smiles on our faces.
The food was great, as were the beers.  Unfortunately, the service was slow.  Our server was new, and not super attentive or knowledgeable about the menu.  Hopefully she'll hit her stride...
I guess my main issue with this place is that it is not what I expected.  They bill themselves as an "American Beer Hall", which to me means:- A large craft beer selection (check)- A good, informal place to gather with friends (nope-though the potential is there)- Maybe some inexpensive pub style food.  However, when you walk inside, you are greeted by a hostess and added to the list for a seat at one of their community tables or bar stools along the window counters.  The food is VERY EXPENSIVE for what it is, and the staff projects a major restaurant vibe, but the atmosphere is that of a bar.I'm really not sure what is going on here but its not at all what I expected.For about a year I anticipated their opening and ended up there on the first night they were open to the public.  I've been back a few times, and it only seems to have become more restaurant-y.  One positive thing to say, the beer selection is excellent and the price is right for draft beers.  That said, It's not easy to get in for just a few beers (especially for more than 1-3 people), so I have ended up passing it up when going out with friends even though I live 3 blocks away.I really hope that Hog's will make up its mind, are you an up-scale restaurant or are you a beer hall? Right now you are somewhere in-between and it just isn't working for my demographic at all.
If you're looking for a spot with tons of (mostly) local beers on tap, this is a great spot to visit. Death and Taxes is my favorite beer they have. They also have a small selection of wines if beer isn't your thing. The Grilled Greens starter I had there was meh. It was way too salty for me. I wouldn't recommend it. However, I heard the corn dog is amazing, i will have to try it next time I'm there. The Devilbird (fried chicken on top of some spicy garbanzo beans with chili oil) OMG. So delicious and perfectly spicy. So buttermilky and crispy! I love the fried chicken there. It never disappoints. Service is great there, I've never had any issues with the staff whatsoever. They're always nice and prompt! Also: be prepared to get a little cozy with other patrons, the seating is picnic table style.
Great beer selection, corn dog and hot dog were ok but made in house. pate, rillette were on point. would def come back for some beer and pate.
Kinda shocking to read reviews about how snobby the wait staff was, I found the service to be very friendly and helpful. As for the food and beer - YUM. The food was so flavorful, with fresh herbs and the sauce on the pork chops was unbelievable. Loved it so much, we asked the waitress if we could have some bread so we could sop up every ounce, because yes, we are hogs. The kitchen specially prepared some toast for us so we could lick the plate clean. The beer selection was good, the menu described the brews well and I was pleased with my selection. The interior is pretty cool, but can get loud. Looking forward to returning.
If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! There food and beer is fantastic! They have an industrial feel to them and sure its a hipster joint but that doesn't detract from the delicious food and beer!Recommendations: 1. Butchers coffer. Get all three, every time. Its worth it2. Lil Salty3. Any of their sausagesBeer: 1. The Butcher 2. Tunnel VisionGreat Job guys
Only tried the beers here so I can't comment on food. There was a great variety of drinks and the bartender was so nice to let me try several until I found a beer I was satisfied with. Sucks that its so hard to find a seat here, it seems like they could better maximize their space. Also the lighting in here was so dark. But overall, another trendy restaurant to hang out with friends.
I'm a little biased since it's right up my street, but Hog's is a pretty special place. The rotating taps, solid food, and ambiance are great. Tried their brunch for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. Had the pork belly/beef burger and apothecary benedict at our table and both were very tasty. They also were open to showing the football game our group wanted to watch. Overall, a solid four stars, and my go-to neighborhood bar. Much, much better reason to come to 40th Street than Homeroom.
Hot damn.  We came here for their soft opening, and we've been coming here regularly ever since.  The food: fantastic, inventive, and there's always something new.  It tends to be heavy fare (even the vegetable sides and salads, which will frequently have an egg or lardons), but it's always delicious.  We've tried things from every section of their menu and have never been disappointed (well, I didn't like their collards, but I'm from Kentucky.  The kale, on the other hand, is always amazing).The beer: excellent selection of mostly local breweries.  They generally have good prices ($5-$6, though watch out for the expensive Rare Barrel offerings), as well as a nice balance of beer styles, ranging from pilsners to Belgian Quadrupels, and thankfully not too many IPAs.The service: we've had one or two servers who weren't on the ball, but the regular staff is fabulous, friendly, and knowledgeable about their beers.  I love that the owners are typically around, pitching in.  They're really friendly if you get the chance to talk to them.The cons?  It can get loud at times, but that shouldn't be an issue if you go earlier in the evening.  But that's a pretty minor drawback when everything else is so good.
Just.... meh. Pros: Big beer selectionInteresting menuCool vibeDecent foodCons:HORRIBLE service (waited 2 hours)Overpriced for what you getLoudI wouldn't go back. It definitely wasn't worth the $90+ dollars my husband I spent on a few drinks, an appetizer, and one entree.
I LOVE the food and the beer list at Hog's. The service has always been good to above average in terms of speed, attentiveness and product knowledge. The house made sausages are great, the schnitzel great, the fried chicken so plump and juicy. The beer list has many styles from many great big and small California craft breweries. I would say there beer list rivals any beer hall in Oakland including the Good Hop, Beer Rev and Cato's. HOWEVER, they were spendy, $14 for a bratwurst, when I first started going there 1 year ago and now they are $17. They are served with  some homemade chips and a small pile of pickled veggies. Hog's like everything else in "up and coming" Oakland is darned expensive for modest portions. Beers have gone up $2/pint as well.  I get they have high rent, need to pay employees a living wage and nothing is getting cheaper but my sense is these trendy dining houses are going for it because their clientele will pay whatever they try to charge at a cool place. I'll miss you, Hogs, but $17 bucks for a fancy hot dog and $7.50 for a pint of IPA isn't a good value. 4 stars for beer and food, 4 stars for service and atmosphere, 2 stars for value. Average 3 stars.
Hip neighborhood joint, with the usual trendy, expensive spin. I did enjoy the food, (yum!), and the beer, (good beer menu selection). I'd give the place 4 stars, but the value is lacking. $23.47 for a beer ($5.50), a side of bacon ($6?!) and a Brussel Sprout salad with bacon bits &amp; one egg ($10?!). It's too expensive to make it a regular stop.
My friends and I had a good time. I'd go back.Awesome if you like beer, which we do. Also, beer + meat = amazing. Get the meatballs. Nice atmosphere, a beer hall, kinda romantical, actually. Bummer? The service. Awkward, lackluster.  Although the server didn't really eat meat, they also didn't seem interested in the food or beer. No recommendations or knowledge about either. Which is fine - I believe I was far more excited, and we can both ride that wave. Also, the hostess was strange. If I worked there I'd own it  - its easy to make service industry customers who came to get drunk and spend money happy.  At least at my job it is. This place has so much potential - can you imagine if the service was at the very least  - engaging? It has a casual vibe, but once you see the prices you'll be looking for some engagement, I promise you. Some other random cute staff would come by and be nice and fill water and I was grateful. The beer float is small, but very good.
super excited about this addition to the 40th/broadway area. the service, the foods, the beer selection(!), the ambiance, the space, everything gets an A+!we got sat along the bar that is built around the perimeter of the pub, facing out onto 40th, and we had no complaints. our server was so on top of it, it actually took me by surprise. I'm just not used to someone checking in every 10 minutes, but this is what we experienced. we were not of want of anything... from water to new beers, she was there to make sure we had what we needed. and the place was packed. other highlights - the house made pretzels. GET ONE. the music was perfect, not too loud, but just loud enough that I picked up on one of my fave bands of all time - pavement, then some sonic youth, plus some other 90's-ish indie rock that I was definitely digging. parking as others have mentioned is a breeze. and it's also just a block or two down from the local record shop (1,2,3,4 go records), the cool mens shop - Pine &amp; Elder, etc. so you can get your shop on beforehand if you so choose. finally, I just need to add that I was more than just a little excited about their beer offerings. and I'm not even a huge beer drinker. the two that I tried - a dark chocolatey number  (coffee &amp; cigarettes by CellarMaker) and a local herbal beer that came recommended (a style I never even knew existed but one that I'm kinda dying to sample again!) completely blew me away. this is the stuff I expect from a beer institution like Trappist but not from the new neighborhood pub. yet, hog's is the spot I have a hankering to return to... asap. stop by before there's a line out the door. it's only a matter of time!
It was really tasty! I was very impressed with the beer selection. If I wasn't the one that drove I swear I would have tried at least 5 on the list. My friend and I split two of the sausage sandwiches and both were very good. The atmosphere is very hipster. They have a shuffleboard in the back. The seating is bench style where you'll be seated at a long table, possibly next to really obnoxious people that you have to just try to ignore and talk over and try not to look at and throw death stares over. (If I had that 5th beer I'm sure I would have become best friends with them...)
We feel happy to report we live only ten minutes away and can return repeatedly with no effort. A creative menu with fabulous execution, we have enjoyed everything we have ordered.  The salads and starters are great. We loved their version of a Caesar salad. The sausages are fabulous with homemade chips and slaw, yummy. Their skirt steak and pork chops are incredible.  Let's not forget a large on tap beer menu.   Marvelous find.
First met Tim as he was sourcing his ingredients from local farmers markets, a year ago.  I still see him there today.     Tonight was my first night to visit and eat, and I was not disappointed.  I tried two starters, a salad and two of the sausage sandwiches.  I could go on and on to say how the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sausages burst with complex but not overwhelming flavors, and lard fried chips were crisp and light.   But I won't, and just say that they have a large array of detailed local beers, and they craft their food with thought, care and precision from farm to fork.    Yum!
If you are looking for a good heavy meal and unique beer in Oakland, the Hog's Apothecary is the place to be.  Its a small neighborhood restaurant, that has an industrial tap house feel.  The staff was friendly and service was great.  I would not say the service was particularly fast or slow, but servers were attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. I really enjoyed the beer list.  It seemed to feature mostly small local breweries (many I had never even heard of).  The variety of the beer selection was great and everything we tried was wonderful.  I love trying new beer, especially from small California breweries, and I loved that this restaurant offered a wide variety of choices. The restaurant does take reservations. They seem to be busy while we were there so if you can get a reservation I recommend it.  However (according to the website, only some of the restaurant can be reserved, so they also take plenty of walk-ins).  There are two TVs above the bar area, so If you are hoping to catch a game on TV they have you covered. Our food was excellent. All of the small bites were great. The pretzel was my favorite. That alone could have been my meal.  The spicy mustard was GREAT, but spicy!! If you love horseradish you will LOVE this mustard (and its perfect with the buttery flavor of the pretzel).  I had the Titanic salad.  It was great and plenty of food for a main meal.  My husband had half dozen oysters and ribs and he had nothing but positives to say about that.  My only criticism about the experience was that the restaurant was very warm inside.  The windows were open but it didn't seem to provide much airflow. Its a small space, so with the kitchen cooking and a full restaurant it can become uncomfortably warm.  Overall, great beer, yummy food and nice people.  We will definitely go back.
Pros:  fast and friendly service           Food is hearty and good           Good beer selectionCons: food is very heavy .....but it's good
First time dining here today.  Had reservations for Mother's Day.  We were seated quickly, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our waiter showed up.  I had been looking around, with pleading eyes, hoping maybe someone could take the time to get a mimosa started for a mom.  But no.  No water, nothing.  The place was still half empty.The food was really good though.My son ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits were kind of drowned in the gravy, so my son wasn't eating them.  I asked if he could have a dry biscuit and they said sure no problem.  Of course surprise when the bill came- they just had to charge us the $5 for the dry biscuit- which was about 15 cents of ingredients.  If they had warned us at the time they they weren't simply trying to help a customer be satisfied with their meal, and would be charging us, maybe I would not have been so annoyed.  But between the 20 minute wait for service and the nickel and diming, it left me not looking forward to a return.If you care nothing about service, this place will be just fine.
Visited today 5.4.16 I was working from home today and my friend stopped by to visit me. We got really hungry and decided to be adventurous and try a new place. The hog's apothecary has been on my list for quite some time now. I bookmarked it for their corn dog. It was pretty empty for a Wednesday at lunch. I guess it's to be expected. Sadly, they didn't have the corn dog offered today at lunch. I decided to get the trail park boy. Their bread is good! The mortadella was new to me. I liked it, a bit too salty. Actually salt was a big problem with our meal here. We share the supernova appetizer/starter. It was a mixed green beet salad with herb crème fraîche. It was so incredibly SALTY. We kind of forced ourselves to eat it when we honestly should've just sent it back or just stopped eating it. The only thing good about the salad was the toasted hazelnuts. My side salad that came with my sandwich was also wayyyy to salty. I didn't even try to eat it. We drank two jugs of water while we were there. This place was pretty disappointing. /: I wouldn't come back here unless it was to try their corn dog.
Excellent experience at this place. Communal seating, sports TVs, great service, and gourmet artisan food. Their products are quality, and so even though they're pricey, they are decently portioned. They change their menu every day, so that's exciting.
Fun place in Oakland! I came here for dinner with friends after a day of drinking our way through Napa.Outside, you'll be impressed with the big clean windows and inside, you'll find community tables and a menu with lots of beers...and a surprising amount of hotdogs. Most of my group went the hotdog route but I opted for the "Pride of Castroville" which was delicious with juicy artichokes. Fun service, chill atmosphere.
Lively, quality gastropub that's helping to put the area around 40th Street and Broadway on the map as a new dining corridor in Oakland, with a feel and identity that's distinct from gentrified Piedmont Avenue not far away.The first things you notice are the tremendous craft beer selection and the meat/pork-heavy menu. As for the beer, the selection is quite extensive and although it features mostly craft brews, it looks like it's been curated to be very comprehensive across all major styles. Moreover, if you have any questions about any single beer item, you could ask for a little taste, or you could ask for advice on what pairs well with certain dishes on the menu.And as for the menu, it is quite meat-heavy (although I assume some items may be vegetarian-friendly or can be made so). While items like sausages might sound steep at around $13, the portion size is tremendous, and the case of the "Got Seoul" sausage that they offered recently, it comes topped uniquely with Asian ingredients. There are even meatier, more substantial entrees available too, all with whimsical names to them. Everything is so meaty and delicious, you'll be "mmm"-ing with approval throughout the meal.The overall atmosphere is quite friendly and festive, with lots of communal seating, and the place can be packed most of the time. Service is also knowledgeable and friendly too. Chalk up another win for the 40th Street area and for the Oakland dining scene.
Your typical hipster joint. Bearded men, beer, beer snacks made in-house, pretzels.Crater Lake Root Beer was delish. Served in a metal cup with perfectly square ice cubes that don't get in the way, it has a refreshing but light sassafras taste. It's $5 for about 10 oz.Pretzel was pretty average. The mustard was more like wasabi pretending to be mustard. The malted mayo was brown mayo.The space is pretty comfortable but service was okay. No one came to our table for quite a while until we asked.
Awesome brunch. Hangar steak and eggs were perfectly rare and runny (respectively) and biscuits with friend chicken add-on was gooey and juicy (respectively)Draught iced coffee was strong without being overly bitter and creamy smooth cream.Service was quick and attentive and just as hipster as one would expect.
A happy find in Oakland.  Interesting selection of beers and tasty food.  I had the New York Reuben sandwich and was very satisfied.  The pastrami is almost shredded, which worked fine, and the flavor was excellent.  Husband had the meatball sandwich and enjoyed it tremendously.  Freshly made potato chips were perfectly cooked.  We will happily go back anytime.
This is a very difficult place to decide whether it's a 3 or a 5 star. I opted for 4 stars, and here's why. The ambiance is beautiful. The lighting is low and glowing, and extremely inviting. The overall setup of this restaurant is well thought out. And they have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap; different local breweries with brief descriptions. Their food is pretty good. It's a bit pricey for my wallet, but that's with the understanding the local (sustainable) farmers provide produce and meat. And it's good. Just beyond my budget for the most part. I have a pretty decent job and all, but this is Oakland after all, and $25 entrees, no matter how high the quality of food, is just not within my budget of reasonable spending for a single entree, not including drinks, not including  my partner  or her  choice of food and beverage. I will probably just stick to going there for some booze. The bartenders are great, the servers are somewhere between mediocre and great, and overall this business seems to have a lot of pride and it presents itself well. Definitely worth stopping by for a beer and scoping things out. It's very inviting.** honorable mention, this is with respect to Jack R review. Just wanted to make the argument that Jack's review is wildly inappropriate. Not only is it borderline chauvinistic with his constant mention of how attractive the waitress was, but it's inappropriate with respect to how his failure to order left the waitress to awkwardly make suggestions and order food for him, that he later, somehow, "realized" he didn't know what she had ordered, and therefore he did not like it. Went on to joke about how his friend nearly pushed the waitress into his lap, then complained about the food again. You're a douche, Jack. I think you should take your review down. **
My girlfriend and I went on a double date with two of our friends, and we had dinner at The Hog's Apothecary. It was a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd. This restaurant has communal tables which is something that I absolutely disdain. As someone who has a busy schedule and is in a long distance relationship, my time with my girlfriend, my friends, and my family is precious to me. When I finally get the time to spend with my self-selected company, I hate having to shout over strangers to avoid being drowned out by their own conversations. That being said, the communal tables at Hog's were not nearly as cramped as the ones at Homeroom. You still have to do a lot of yelling though. The hard wooden benches were pretty uncomfortable too. Everything else about the restaurant was really great though. They offer a preponderance of great local and semi-local beers on tap. I had the Buddha's Hand IPA from Berryessa Brewing in Winters, CA, and it was awesome. It was not overly bitter and had a pleasant citrus taste from the Buddha's hand. Everyone else enjoyed their beers as well.My girlfriend and I started our meal with a soft pretzel. The pretzel had a rich, brown skin and was light and airy on the inside. I really enjoyed the spicy mustard dipping sauce that came with the pretzel. The heat from the mustard hits you right in the sinuses (in a good way).For our meal, we shared the corn dog and the Jamaican Me Crazy sausage.Corn dog: Easily one of the best (non-State Fair) corn dogs I've ever had. However, I feel like corn dogs are kind of like donuts. Awful ones are still pretty good, and even the best version with the best possible ingredients is only a few times better than the average ones. Jamaican Me Crazy: The sausage was tasty, although the jerk seasoning could have been a little more bold. I only tasted faint traces of allspice. The bun pillow-soft and provided a textural contrast to the pop I would get when biting into the casing of the sausage. The potato chips were tasty too. While both items were really good, they do seem a little overpriced for what they are.Our service was good, although there was some redundancy between the servers. Several different people came around to take our orders and this led to some confusion when my girlfriend ordered a second beer and two of the servers mistakenly thought that the other one would get the beer. They got it right eventually though.Overall, I like The Hog's Apothecary and would come back another time for beer and a corn dog.
Every time I pass by Hog's Apothecary, it's filled to the brim with customers. The menu is filled with (overpriced) sausage options. I guess it's their specialty, but no way in hell I am buying into gourmet hotdogs prices anymore. I already think Rosamunde and Wurstkuche in LA are overhyped and overpriced so $12+ for a dog? I really don't think so.Instead, I tried out the brunch menu. At first look, everything is pleasant. The servers are nice, the interior is open with long communal tables, and they have an extensive "hipster" beer list. I'm on a Belgian kick lately for I get the two Belgian beers and they are both delicious. After we ordered the food, about 45 minutes have passed and we are already close to finishing our second beer. The service is painfully slow. In fact, I saw some other tables that came in after us getting their food first. What's up with that?They see us get a bit antsy and assure us our food is coming out. I receive my French Monsieur which is good, with a nice kick of Horseradish. I also try the Apothecary Benedict and must admit, the house made ham is quite good. Everything tastes pretty good but they are all pretty much heart attacks on a plate. The food is definitely better than average but not enough to make me keep wanting to come back. The problem with this place, and a bunch of other new hipster joints in Oakland, is that everything is "artisanal" but that doesn't mean it necessarily makes everything taste better nor does it justify the stiff prices. There are too many places in Oakland which offers a good beer list and hipster food, but it's kind of getting out of hand. What's next, $20 sausage made with baby dragon butt and foie gras? I digress but I didn't feel Hog's was a step above any other already existing places. That's why I'll give it an A-OK.
We brought some of our fam here, because I mean it has hog in the name--- why wouldn't we? They only serve beer and wine, so don't expect a full bar.  The menu is a great mix of stuff to share and entrees.  We ordered a mix of bar snacks, appetizers and one entree to share.  Everything was super tasty! The staff was super awesome.  The one thing that I didn't like was the bench seating (I need a seat back when filling my belly) and there was no where to hang my jacket &amp; purse.  We will definitely go back here to try more of the menu
My wife &amp; I decided to start out 2016 with brunch here today.  Brunch was quite busy today, so it was good that we made a reservation.  She started with a mimosa, while I had a pint of hefeweizen (a tough choice, as they have over 25 beers on draft).  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  You can get either maple syrup or gravy with this order, but I recommend the syrup.  The onion waffle and fried chicken are very savory, so the sweetness of the syrup brings a nice balance.  They use boneless chicken thighs, so you can forgo utensils and just dig in with your bare hands!My wife ordered a benedict, which comes with the house pastrami.  The egg was cooked perfectly, but the dish (along with the house potatoes) were a little on the salty side.We ordered a side of bacon to share, which could have been cooked a little longer.The service was excellent:  attentive, but not overbearing.  The place got pretty loud as it got crowded, but it was very festive for the holiday.
I was out Free Wheeling and I had a fresh Charge on my Ankle Bracelet . Today was a good day to eliminate another Book Mark .So I rolled to The Hogs Apothecary and Oaktown.I rolled up and Parked right across the street . No Parking Lot just Street Parking .They also have Bike Parking right up front. The Cool Thing is the Front Door Handles are Shaped like Giant Meat Cleavers.I was Greeted upon Entering and  Grabbed  a Seat at the Bar. The Furnishings are Very Sturdy and some of it is from Repurposed Materials very cool. Their Bar Menu and Food Menu Change Daily . They also Butcher a Whole Pig every Tuesday and they use every part in Meal preparation .They have 2 LCD TVs for Sporting Events .They also have a Nice Big Open Air Skylight .Their Bartenders are a Wealth of Info .They have several Micro Brews on Tap.I ordered a Whippersnapper -Southern English Style Brown Mild Ale . I Liked It.I then ordered a Chocolypto - Imperial Stout with Oatmeal and Cacao . I really like this one it was Rich and Robust .My Final Beer was Framboos / Batch 28 -Belgian Style Ale with Raspberries . This is a Must Order very Flavorful and Fruity .For Dinner I Ordered The Belgian Braise - House Butchered Pork Shoulder braised in Societe ale , heirloom grits , charred radish rapini  braising  jus ,hard herb- bread crumb salsa .This was very good the Pork was so Tender it melted in my Mouth . Yummy I also ordered a Corn Dog and it Came with House rendered Lard Fried Kennebec Potato Chips and Mixed Pickles . This was also good .My Servers were Very Nice and Prompt . I Paid By Discover Card and Rolled out.
The fried chicken was piled high and looked scrumptious, but it was raw.  Not under done, not pink.  Gelatinously raw.  I asked that it be removed from the bill which they did, but I was surprised our server didn't seem more alarmed by the fact that raw chicken made it onto the plate. This is fine if you like communal tables.
It took me awhile, but I finally got to try Hog's and for brunch, nonetheless.I came on a Saturday and there was a good crowd and we got seated right away. I had one of their many beers on tap, though I don't recall which one. I went with the Belgian Waffles with Fried Chicken. The waffles were savory and the fried chicken was a must. Otherwise, what's the point? The dish was excellent. Though the person I was with got the something else, it was very small for the price, even though my dish was a bit pricey as well. I don't remember what he got, as it is not on the menu online. The food is good and the service is good as well. This is a place I would come to every once in a long awhile, but certainly worth a try.
I live down the street so I always end up here when I can't make a decision on what to eat. Great beer selection and excellent food. Menu is always changing, which is nice because I can always order something new. The bartender told us they base their menu off of what is available that day. Also, service has always been super friendly.
I should have ordered the Fried Chicken.As good as that dish looked though (and as much as I wanted to try it), I knew I had to order something pork related.  After all, between Hog's Apothecary's name and their giant pig statue that hovered behind me, it'd practically be sacrilegious not to!  And I am not one to mess with the pork/bacon/pork belly powers that may be (all hail, Bacon!).With a menu that is constantly changing, Hog's Apothecary has a lot to offer, even if the day's menu isn't super extensive - roughly a dozen starters and sides, a handful of sausages, and a few different entrées.  What's more, there's beer and lots of it.  With over 25 varieties on tap (mostly craft brews), you could even forgo eating and just sample beers all night long.-- SPICY PORK CRACKLIN'S...$3(yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…)These cracklin's are crackin'!  Not only are they borderline addictive, but they really do pack some heat, as every piece is coated with a spicy, mouth-watering seasoning (don't forget the lime!).  What's more, the portion is quite generous!  A great starter for groups to share.-- BOURBON-CHICKEN LIVER PATE...$6(yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…)Although larger slices of bread would have been nice to spread out all that pate, I'm not definitely not complaining about those giant gobs either!  While every bite was rich and decadent, the taste was also nicely accentuated by the sea salt and the berries.  If this isn't the best one I've had, it wouldn't be far behind.-- SUPERFECTA SAUSAGE SANDWICH - Pork, Rabbit, Chicken, Tim's Brown Ale, Basque Chili &amp; Mild Herbs, Fennel-Onion Braise, Dijon Mustard...$14(yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…)The only blemish, but it was a big one.  I was hopeful for trio of meats in the sausage, but it wasn't even juicy, let alone flavorful.  Ironically, the braise had the opposite effect, overpowering whatever flavor the meat had with fennel.  Sadly, besides the chips, the only other thing I enjoyed were the pickled vegetables.As underwhelming as my order was, it really was the only "bad" thing about my experience.  Great food otherwise, an awesome selection of beers, fantastic staff (they let our large party split our bill into smaller tabs), and (relatively) easy parking.  Plus, with several long tables, Hog's Apothecary is grew for groups large or small.Also, it's worth noting that the rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit (we all ordered different things), so it wouldn't surprise me if what I had just wasn't one of their better dishes.  Especially since the starters were really good.  Rounding up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I wonder what might have been if I had only ordered the fried chicken!
4.5 StarsProsA great variety of draft beers + a flight option Pretzel was easily shareable and well done Fun atmosphereChill staff ConsUmmmm can be pricey depending on your beer choice Overall ThoughtsWhile I enjoyed my experience with the beer I want to come back for the food to see if it can be bumped up that last half star!
Order the meatballs (appetizer) and fried chicken. They have tons of beer on tap!  I was in the mood for cider and they had 2 to choose from.I can wait to come back here.  Such a gem!
Will not be returning. I give the ambiance, environment, resources (food and drink) a mediocre mark, nothing special. It was the service I wasn't happy with. I have not ever been talked to like that here in the Bay Area. I brought my service dog and two friends and was felt less than welcomed. Although we did get to sit down for a beer. Our waiter, the bartender, Josh H, near beginning of dinner, was kind of an asshole to my friends and I. He immediately had a tone upon first approach like he wasn't going to like us, asking about my small dog. I told him we had already talked to the manager and were welcomed to sit down... I felt like he would have told us to leave.Josh came over to my friends and I to get our drink order. My friend had a question which left much to be interpreted. Instead of helping my friend out he insulted her by remarking "how all over the place" her question was. I was floored. I later asked for a glass of water. Of course I had my dog in my lap away from others, I gave him a chance to drink out of the glass. Josh comes out of nowhere and immediately rips the glass out of my hand and scolds me. Stroke two. We were all ready to leave by this point. He returned with a paper cup of water for my dog. Sweet? Hardly. He also assumed we wanted separate checks when we did not. Perhaps he was having a bad day but a first impression is a first impression bud. Terrible service. Money is tight for most and I wouldn't waste a second try on somewhere that was just ok. In order to harvest a community you should probably be more friendly to your locals and their pooches. Word spreads fast.
It's currently SF Beer Week.  Like, I'm sad that I even had to work at all this week, but I need the money to taste the beer, so here we are.  Last night, the hubs and I met some good friends at the Hog's Apothecary as they were hosting brews from FiftyFifty Brewing.  I stalked the menu online, and many of their offerings are meat and pork and sausage and YES.  Our server was very friendly and very attentive.   A+Location - near (in?) Temescal in Oakland.  I hear this is a notorious hipsterville area.  No matter, this place is kinda by itself on a corner.  Walking in, there are picnic tables, so you sit community style with others.  There was a bar to my right, communal seating in the middle, and bar seating along the left edge.  I enjoyed the decor, but man, it's loud AF in there.  We were there in the evening, after 7pm and it wasn't super crowded, but it sounded like it. We were fortunate enough to be able to move to a corner booth so we could hear our own conversation. Beer - I sampled two beers and shite, I can't remember the name of the FiftyFifty beer.  It started with an M, if I remember correctly, and it was delicious.  Winner winner!  The second beer was the German Table Beer, a dark German session with wheat.  Also delicious.  I wish it hadn't been a Wednesday night because I would've picked at LEAST three more to try.  The selection is superb.  Most of my stars are dedicated to this.Food - We ordered the Snack Bar and split among us four.  I think it's a good bang for your buck.  You get a HUGE fresh soft pretzel, house made corn nuts, olives, and pork cracklins.  Everything on that platter was delicious, though I feel as though the cracklins were a little stale.  Could've just been me.  Hubs and I split the Steph Currywurst.  It's a good portion for one person.  That was my bad.  Not too overwhelming with the curry flavor, with nice pickled onions and chips on the side.  I left needing something else though....I took away a star due to price.  Yes, the selection is great.  The food is well thought-out and complementary to the beer list.  It was pricey for me though (see 1st paragraph).  A sausage dog, although delicious was $14.  Overall, still a good place.  I'd come here again on a semi-full stomach to sample more beer.
Great brunch place! Friendly service. Sat at the bar and was served by a cool guy from San Diego. A wide variety of beer on tap. The Royale with Cheese was amazing. The oysters were sweet. I will definitely return to try the pumpkin pie donut holes!
If you want a sausage and beer, this is definitely the place to be! Also, if you're a giant hipster, go here:) the quality is excellent, the vibe is trendy (in all it's dark wood and metal accents, with some great pops of corrugated metal at the bar).This place is a major thumbs up, bring your friends and it'll be a great time!
I am glad I like this place because it's literally across the street from me. Be aware it gets PACKED and it's really not the place to just drop in for a beer on the weekend. They are really particular where you sit too so aside from the bar you must check in with the host/hostess. The food is good however a bit overpriced but the pretzel is huge and very reasonably priced. But you're really coming her for the beer. The beer list is great. Let me say that again-- the beer list is great. A ton of time goes into crafting this and you can tell. Everyone working there knows a ton and will recommend and let you tastes everything first. I miss the little shuffle board they used to have but they totally needed the space given how popular Hog's has become. It's great for the neighborhood and I am a big fan.
Bacon. Pretzel. Fried chicken. Millions of local brew on tap. This man I know, who I call Lester, not his real name, of course, who is from the great state of Iowa, would have loved this place like hog in mud. My pre-race meal. It was very children friendly. I unfortunately was having a discussion with my dining partner about why men always cheat when a young couple with young children sat down. Yes it was a communal table style. So conversation of controversy could be overheard. Though I should not apologize for we have freedom of speech here and plus I know I am right. I am the confession chamber to many guy friends who cheat but feel guilty.Social commentary aside, this is kind of restaurant that serves the food for the people. Basic yet upscale. Possibly the best fried chicken with collard greens I have ever eaten. I ordered the pork shoulder with grits, delicious. Pretzel with two kinds of gourmet mustard, yum. But, the most surprising thing was the apple and celery root soup called fruit and root soup. Creamy, yes, but also very light and sweet. Very girlie dish I think. I think the sausages looked great. I want to come back to try the local brew. Very fashionable. This place felt a bit Midwestern and a bit of the South, and slightly Brooklyn. Oakland is having a moment. I sort of kind of want to share my finds with everyone. Time to make some new friends so I can show them how Oaklanders do food.
We arrived early for our reservation so sat at the bar where we enjoyed some of the amazing beers they have on tap. The service and atmosphere was so great we decided to just fine at the bar and what a treat. We had bar snacks of olives and spicy pork crackling - both delicious. Next the chickfritz which made me wish I could cook so well. For our main we shared the shrimp and grits - let's say I had to strongly resist licking the plate! Final course was the pumpkin and pretzel donuts with a custard sauce. I'll admit to drinking what was left of the custard sauce. The donuts themselves were packed with flavor and delightfully moist. Finally did I mention the beer selection? Great choice of local small brews, many of which I love so glad Hogs supports them. I will definitely be back
Wasn't impressed with the food or service,but the place looks nice. Wouldn't go back.
This area is infested with hipsters and there's nothing to complain about that. This restaurant is exactly what this area needed! Craft beer galore. This is a more intimate hipster place with cafeteria tables and a bar stools all around (they really want you to start talking to the strangers). What I lovvvvveeee is the style and the Devore of this place. The plentiful of windows and the high ceilings... It really comfortable here.They have a huge selection of craft beer all over the east Bay Area as well as out of town beers.For now I only tried their hot dogs and pretzel. The pretzel was good! Nice and soft and really big enough for two. Just AVOID dipping a huge piece into their yellow home made mustard sauce. It taste like wasabi. As for the hotdog, Jamaican Jerk Off. It was ok. The Bun broke off cause it was so soft. The sausage was good. The vegetable they added on top didn't chop off well with the bite. I mean it's a hot dog, so simple but they made it so complex that it was hard to understand why. I would come back again for the beer for sure
Went there again recently and was actually amazed by the food. Had mussels and some kind of fabulous salad and vegetable fritter thing. It was so fresh, interesting and delicious! (Yes. I licked the plate.) Sometimes it's just a matter of respecting your own culinary boundaries and finding the right thing to eat. And of course, enjoying The Hog's creative and excellent execution.
Not sure what's going on but we have been sitting here for 30 minutes! We came in and the waitress took our beer order. 10 minutes later got our beers! She never came back walked around helping all 10 people in the restaurant. Trying to flag her down no eye contact smh. Well at least my dead canary is good. oh boy she walked by again!! Check please I guess we can't try the food. Let me change it to one star even ride when asking for the check!!
I came here during restaurant week and it was pretty busy. The service was great and the food was okay.
Excellent beer selection Slowish service, only had maybe 1 or 2 waitstaff for a  busy Saturday night. I was going to order the corn app but thankfully I was told it was essentially corn nuts.Pistachio mortadella was goodPork  crackling was deliciousShrimp grits were absolutely fantasticCorn dog was extremely dissapointing, the breading fell apart and wasn't crispy or thick enough and the sausage was bleh.
Sorry, but don't believe the hype. Although Hog's is a guiding light for the Temescal gentrification movement, the service is kind of pretentious dudes old timey haircuts and ironic t-shirts, the food is meh, and the vibe is kind of wack. Thanks for the $7.50 beer and microwaved pretzel. Wah-wahhhhhh.
You know, I found the menu very hard to navigate. Maybe I went at the wrong time of the day? But we were only offered a bar menu and it was not straight forward. I felt almost intimidated trying to figure out why we had to de-code it. We had to ask the waitress a few times what is what and how we get what we want. She seemed at awe why we would ask suchhhh questions but then she served us marinated olives from a MASON jar. That was when I figured out we were going to be spending money on cool instead of food, so we nibbled and left. I may or may not stick my head in another time, just to see if their regular dinner menu will not be served on burlap or a birds nest. The restaurant itself is very pretty though!
I went here with two of my friends for Oakland Restaurant Week; unfortunately, we came at dinner and the offer was not available! Bummer! You walk in, and there is a bar, benches (Biergarten status), and stools around the edges. The decor was nice and even featured a giant hog. FOOD: We got the meatball appetizer and I got the Extras sandwich. My friends got the Area 51 and the Kielbasa. Overall, tasty. The food comes with freshly made chips and pickled vegetables. The chips were HEAVILY salted that I felt that it was just not good. Please hold back on the salt. Veggies were fine. The sausage combo itself was pretty good. DRINK:I got a double IPA. The place has a lot of beer options and are constantly rotating with choices, so beer options are great here. SERVICE: I was pleased with the service. Our waitress was attentive, but nothing spectacular, but our food and drinks come out in within a reasonable amount of time. Although, she took away our full water pitcher and gave it to another party. I was confused, but mistakes like that happen. OVERALL:To sum it up, very expensive, which probably is why it's 3 stars. For what I ate, the quality, and all, I don't see how I can justify $14 for a "sandwich" (a hot dog). We were content with the place at the end of the night, but believed the price and quality disparity was too big.
...I changed my mind. (after my last visit)Smarmy host. Over priced food. Yacky, pretentious &amp; droning hipster wannabes. It's downright annoying. I'm not going back. 'tis a shame. Nice bartender. Great beer selection.  ...oh well.
Great place to get a drink, and the food (at least, our pretzels) is great! They have a large variety of beers. I had the red flight, everyone else had lighter beers. The beer and the pretzels were all amazing!
Quick stop for a snack before heading out to a late dinner. The beer selections were pretty impressive! Decided to try the Hock &amp; Trotter Terrine - could use a bit of seasoning. The flavors didn't mix in together as well as we expected it to. Still overall satisfying.
Despite passing by this place several times on my trek to Piedmont, I had never set foot in The Hog's Apothecary until this evening. I had always felt a tad bit put off by the name, as I am a strict vee-gan. Their menu didn't seem to be very veg-friendly (rather, not at all). However, my friend Lindsey (also a veg) brought me here, and I thought it was pretty neat, as far as bars go. I tried the Societe beer flight this evening ($10), which featured tantalizing names for each brew: The Harlot, The Debutante, and The Widow. All three of the beers hailed from San Diego. The service was a touch unfriendly, but I've come to expect that same surliness with hipster locales in the East Bay. The dining area and bar were both pretty jam-packed, so the host placed us, standing, at a counter by the window. The server seemed to dislike this placement, but where else were we to go? I think I would have bumped this one up to a 5 if the staff had took initiative and found us a table.. Even so, at the end of the day, all of the beers I tasted were delicious, and I would definitely return to sample more of their cold beverages.
The ambiance here is really nice. The beer is delicious and food is amazing. The pretzels with wasabi mustard sauce really opens your airway and taste so good.
Been here for lunch and dinner now and it's been great!  The menu is limited but with enough choices and diversity for everyone to be able to find something.  Extensive beer menu but I dont think liquor.  Seating is communal on some tables to be ready to rub elbows with a stranger.  Looking forward to going back as they update their menu.
Loudest restaurant I've ever been in making the experience uncomfortable right as it began.  The cracklins were chewy, not really crunchy, and didn't have any pork flavor to it.  The terrine was too subtle and came on bread which tasted like it was a day old.  My Versace sausage was one of the better ones I've had, well seasoned and juicy with a good kick, served on a soft bun which tasted kind of like a Hawaiian roll. The potato chips were fine but nothing special, reminds me of in-n-out fries which are "more fresh" but also just don't taste as good as other stuff you find.Overall a pretty average meal in an unpleasant setting.
Wow! Literally the best benedict I ever had, and from a gastropub no less.  The meat was amazing and the egg was perfectly poached.  Excellent job! And I'm typically someone who is very particular with it comes to breakfast (I have a sous vide at home so it's hard to beat sous vide eggs).  Plus great beer selection on top of that!
Had a nice lunch here with a mimosa and a "Vietnamese" sausage sandwich with an egg on it. quite good. You sit at communal tables. Maybe next time we come here for happy hour.
We came back for dinner to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (dropped in without a reservation) and in almost no time at all, we were seated in the exact same place as our first visit back in July. We had the same server, AND she remembered us! Pretty awesome. The blue cheese stuffed figs are not on the menu currently but they make some damn good steak (with blue cheese BUTTER!!! WOWWWW) and fries. I loved looking around the restaurant while we were eating and seeing how the staff all interacted with each other - laughing, talking, and at one point I looked up in time to see someone down half a glass of beer. I don't mean to imply they're unprofessional; rather I get the impression that people that work here love being around each other and working together in an environment that they enjoy, which definitely makes for a fun dining experience. If we lived closer (and made a bit more money) I'd want to be regulars.Seriously guys, if you're ever in the area, skip the crowds waiting outside Homeroom (although I also love that place) and just go about a block up for some of the best dishes in the east bay.
Brunched here twice and the food has been delectable:Softshell crab Benedict - I snapped that up the moment I saw it, and so glad I did because it wasn't on the menu the next time I went here!  It was just as good I imagined it would be, plus the potatoes on the side were amazing.Savory waffle + fried chicken - I had this with both gravy and syrup, and really it should be done no other way.  The fried chicken was boneless (all the easier to inhale you with, my dear), moist on the inside, crunchy but not greasy on the outside.  The waffles were cornmeal-y, also with the perfect amount of crispness most becoming of a waffle.  Have this dipped in syrup, and then the next bite smeared with gravy, then a bite of chicken, and so forth.  I can guarantee the couple next to you who hasn't gotten their entrees yet will be slightly uncomfortable at you and your spouse's eating moans.  Service was great.  I would say in the summer be prepared for a cold drink along with everything else.
Waltzed in here with a reservation for 2, just in case, on a Sunday morning for brunch. Upon first observation, this place is bright, open and cute!! Community tables for the social people and a few private tables for people like me. My friend opted for the Pastrami Benedict with Schmaltz Potatoes and I went for the Fried Chicken and Spring Onion Waffles with Huckleberry Jam. Let's not forget the mimosas, a brunch requirement. Delicious. That is all I have to say. Hands down best chicken and waffles I've had so far... And I've had a lot. No bones! I'm all about bones and meat handles but you know there be places that give you only skin and bones. Just meat baby. Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy on the inside. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And those schmaltzy potatoes?! I stole them off my friends plate... So damn good. That flavor! I can't get over this place!
This is one of our go-to brunch spots in the Bay Area. The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is great and we love the space with beautiful light big community tables. Some of our favorites include the French Madame, the schmaltzy potatoes, the Royale with cheese. The staff is always friendly, great customer service.
Hipster is probably the best way to describe this place. The concept, the staff, the menu. This is something that you would expect in Portland - but none of this is necessarily a bad thing.My friend up in Oakland had reached out to me, and while looking at reviews for the Trappist, a mention about the Hog's Apothecary caught my eye. Fortunately the place was a few blocks from my friend and close to my sister. My friend has wanted to try this place, and I was curious.We showed up to standing room only - a good sign. My friend put her name down with a 30 minute wait, and we found a space to look over the beer menu. Really impressive, local menu. Some things I've tried, but there was plenty that I had never even seen before. Started with the 1903 Pre-Prohibition Style American Lager, which was delicious, and intelligently the beers got added to the menu tab for when we sat.Not even 10 minutes later we got a seat. Other than the bar, the place features long tables with benches. Herein lies the one of problem I see with this place: getting in and up from these benches if you have a middle seat and they are already packed. I eventually maneuvered in, but it wasn't easy.The possibly daily-changing menu was confusing to say the least. I still have no idea what Arlo Shirks or Olin Browns are. I get it, hipster. But don't make things difficult on your servers and the patrons - call shit out, like everything else on the menu.Regardless, I went the sausage sandwich route that the person sitting next to me also did: a Darkwing (duck and pork sausage with some kind of delicious greens on top) and the fried grits side. The Darkwing was delicious and hearty, the chips very flavorful, as were the white veggie side. The fried grits were also delicious, but the sausage was big enough that I barely got a dent into the grits.Before leaving my friend and I each ordered one of the daily flights: she went with wheat, I went with hoppy. The Daphne was delicious, but definitely more on the crisp summer day variety of hoppy.I could definitely see coming back, and if I lived in the area, the beers alone might make this a recurring stop. Some of the entrees are a bit on the pricey side, but fortunately there are some cheap options so you don't break the bank.
Great food and rotating taps.  The staff is also wonderful.  I visit often and love their brunch!
A certain someone wanted to try this place for over 4 months now...Here we are at this place with all the open space in the world, but to only see two communal tables in the middle of the room and bar stools along the window counters.  Trying to squeezed us into the edge of the communal table (H-E-L-L to the NO!). We opted to wait for the bar stools instead.With minimal selections, we nibble on some chickpea fritters and meatballs before scarfing down our Moroccan lambs sandwich and hot dogs. Nothing spectacular about the food when all you're given was some pickles and potato chips to go along with your meal.  I'm not looking to return to this place but maybe one day along the line. In fairness, their service was on point and friendly.
Solid food, great atmosphere and interesting beer list. The pretzel is a must. Sausages are good. Fried chicken is good. Totally worth while. Though I dig it it's not a place that's like a total package for me meaning I would suggest it, but I wouldn't go outta my way to go there. It is for sure one of the better spots in that few block radius - not that there are many.
Went "cheap" with the Corn Dog ($8) and asked for a recommendation for the 3 small Charcuterie items. The waitress recommended the Pork Terrine ($6).The terrine comes with toasted slices of Barkada baguette, whole grain mustard, pickle, and olive (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). Despite having visible herbs it was pretty bland on it's own and definitely needed the mustard (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…).The Corn Dog was superb. It's huge and served with lard-y chips, pickles, ketchup and yellow mustard (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). Strong smokey flavor from the hot dog. The chips were all crisp, an improvement from my last visit.They need to beef up the little skewer you can see on the left side of my picture. I first picked the corn dog up with that and it immediately bent and cracked under the weight of the corn dog.
Went to check this place out. Food was okay but service was bad.Duck was dry. Nothing special about the fried chicken. Meatballs were great!!But our server, maybe she was having a bad day, but really inattentive.  She never came and checked in if I wanted another beer. When taking our order she literally left before my friend placed his order. She took my order then turned around and left as he was about to place his order. He had to track her down and give her his order. And she never returned to check how our meals were. It became comical but she was not a good server. I wasn't impressed enough to return. Think it's a lot of hype.
Here's the thing: the food is sadly only 2-2 and a half stars, but the excellent service bumps it up to three stars. 1) the fried chicken was covered in gravy. Like too much and took away from the crispness. No flavor to the batter really and kinda bland. Meh. 2) the corn dog- gf got it and I tried. Also just not as good as it looked. 3) fried pickle appetizers were solid though. 4) great beer selection I will confirm.
I was sooo excited to try HA...I'm so disappointed that our experience left us irritated &amp; disgusted. There was literally 4 other patrons there when we walked in at 5:25pm...at 5:30 dinner started &amp; 5 more parties walked in....we got outta there at 6pm with NO food order since EVERYONE got service before we did. I was appalled no one even stopped by to check how we were doing with our beer that was ordered at the bar.  Funny enough there was a black guy at the bar that was there before we got there that no one was checking on either!!!! The food smelled so good but they weren't getting another cent from me....they went outta their way to avoid making eye contact.  Make sure you look hipster enough if you want any service from Hog's....you just messed with the wrong ONE!
Super yummi y'all! Best fired chicken I ever had (albeit probably the smallest portion). Their Wiener schnitzel was incredible and I'll be back.
This place has an incredible beer list. The beer selector knows their stuff. Always delicious. I live fairly close to this spot so I frequent this place. Hogs does not have anything I eat ( because I'm vegan) but the service, ant the staff are great, so I come anyways. My man loves their sausages and I just like the place. Good beer and great staff and I like the design of the place.
Was looking forward to trying this place as I like beer and pork, and it's within walking distance to my home.  Came with a small  group on a very quiet night (maybe 6 or 7 customers besides us), but was underwhelmed. Had a good beer and intended to eat, but was put off by the service. Example: When I asked the guy behind the bar if a certain beer was good, rather than a friendly "Yes", and maybe describing it, he just dryly said "Define good".  Really? You're gonna just throw it back at the customer with two words to prove how cool and indifferent you are?More than one examples of dickish attitude meant we left after one beer each, and a tab that was less than 1/5 of what was likely as we intended to stay for more beers and dinner, but I guess they "won" because they seemed intent on not making us feel welcome and they achieved it.In the Yelp listing, it says "Ambience: Hipster" and that's accurate.  Judging from the snarky/snotty service, it seems they Hog's Apothecary thinks that's a compliment. In my experience, even hipsters don't like to think of themselves as such. (Are there really people out there who say, "Hipster? I'm there!")This place needs to get over itself and act like they're happy you're there.  The fact that they don't bother to respond to their Yelp reviews seems to be another example of them thinking they're too cool to care.
When you see the word "apothecary" in their name, you just know it's gonna be hipster.  So much so, that I kept feeling like I was in a Portland joint.  Maybe it was the drizzle outside, maybe the multiple sightings of flannels and beards, whatever it may be, I was down with it.  This place is simple yet legit.  A new American Beer Hall is how they deem themselves and I like it.Started with a black beer mixed with pinot noir from Moonlight in Santa Rosa and it was super unique.  Not bad but not something I would want multiples of.  You can definitely taste the wine.  Noshed on their bar ready *spicy* pork cracklings and they were incredibly light and sticky on the tooth.  And spicy was a bit of an understatement, it stung like a mutha.  I suppose they want you to order another beer.A salad of tender butter lettuce, chopped beets, hipster rainbow radishes and a nice blue cheese dressing is a nice starter.  At $10 it is quite spittable.Zsa Zsa $14 is an amazing sausage sandwich.  A Hungarian style which is like a kielbasa on steroids.  Don't know if they make their own sausage but this was one helluva meat specimen in tube form.  It was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Unique toasted bread, a fresh herb/oil spread and thick cut potato chips. Oh I'd grow a hipster beard for this if I could, but I can't, so darn it to hell.Hanger Steak $26 was spot on bistro fare.  Tender bloody meat, blue cheese sauce, sautéed greens and potato gratin.  Very assertive flavors and if you love beef, this will not disappoint.  Only thing was it came out lukewarm and within a minute it was basically cold.  But now with a dry hopped steam beer from Petaluma, all was good.Like the hood, like the brews, like the staff and like the food.  What's not to like?!  This place is a total score.
I am adding an update because I received a note from one of the other bartenders that I have never experienced and he told me to come back when he was working and apologized for the bad experience I had.I stopped in late for an after climbing beer and saw that he was behind the bar so I went in. I ordered a delicious beer, drank my beer and went on my way.I was impressed and very pleased by his service and have gone back twice when I see he is working. He is definitely the gem of that place and like going in for a late night beer when he is working!
The beer selection is excellent.  The food, unfortunately, is mediocre and overpriced.  I'd be there more often if the waiters weren't so snotty and on top of you.  They'll get very pissy if you don't order food, even if it's early evening and the place is barely half full.
I want to love this place. I live a block away away and I want to come, all the time, and to love it. However, due to the poor service I've received on more than one occasion and the clear lack of vegetarian/vegan options I feel forced to give a less than satisfactory review. I'm usually fine with ordering the hot pretzel, which to be fair is awesome, and having one (or two or three) of the amazing beers available, and call it an excellent night. However, on more than one occasion, I've experienced snobby and/or snarky service, which I find quite uncool (I've worked in customer service for over 20 years and know what it's like to give and receive genuinely warm, welcoming, and helpful service).I'll start with the good-often times I've had great servers who were attentive, polite, and top-notch. I've had numerous fantastic beers and beer suggestions and a handful of excellent salads and desserts. However, more than once I've come across employees who were were way less than helpful, and at times, snarky. Boo.Me on a Friday night around 6pm: "Hi, I'd love to grab a quick drink"Hostess (with warmth of of a rock): "There's no room at the bar."Me: "Oh, see there's a spot by the window, can I take that [which they let me have any other night of the week]?"Hostess: "Some people are waiting for those."Ok, I can't have a quick beer in the meantime? You can't say in a friendly tone, 'you're welcome to wait until something opens up...?'Frustrated, I left and decided to go across town where I felt more welcome. I drove by about 15 minutes later (on my way to said place a cross town), and there was still no one in the seat I had asked for (I could see from the huge windows) Glad you keep it for them! (I would have been done, paid, and and out of the seat by then).My next experience: on a Sunday night in which I sit at the bar then ask the bartender if any of the sides are vegetarian. His reply: "Have you seen the name of this place? We can always make you a vegetarian plate if you wish..." Thanks, but why the need for a snarky opening? I could reply, and did: you are a business in vey hipster neighborhood full of vegans and vegetarians. It's unfortunate that you're not more friendly to those diets. He has the audacity to debate with me, which is when I start writing this review.On a positive note, when I'm done with my beer the seemingly manager apologizes for any negativity and offers to pay for me beer. Thanks buddy! You've kept the door open for another chance.Give 'en a try if you're there for a full, non-vegetarian dinner. You may really like it! And, if they shape up a bit and tune in to their local clientele and the general requests of their customers, I'll be back on a regular basis.
Great service and awesome food. Have to admit that I was a bit weary going here with all the reviews about too cool for school hipster servers and I am happy to report that hipster is the only true adjective.We were a group of five plus one baby and they were very accomodating, making sure that we had the right spot where the kiddo wouldn't be knocked over.Food was delicious. We scarfed down the soft pretzels.  Fried chicken was good but not amazing. True to the name, anything with a casing is worth ordering and order one of everything!
I think the food is outstanding.  I have been known to be a less than adventurous eater so i must point out that everything I have had has had me in awe.  Love love the always rotating, fresh craft brew selection and they have a couple wines that are de-lish as well as a sparkling for those not into beer.I must comment on the 2 star review:  You went to an establishment practically named "pork incorporated" and were surprised at the lack of vegetarian options?  And they preceded to tell you they are always happy to make a vegetarian friendly dish on order (I've overheard them offer this to people and thought that was very accommodating!) and you are still less than thrilled with their service?  And if the local clientele is not being represented with such an establishment, then why are they packed regularly and why did another butchery restaurant open just up the block?
Finally had a chance to try this place out as I don't live in the area. What a gem! We tried several items on the menu and all to a dish were superbly thought out, created, plated and delicious.  My favorite by far was the charcuterie ... all made in house of course.Beyond the food, the beer list is extensive and eclectic.  From what the owners said, constantly rotating as well so I'd encourage frequent visits to sample them all of course. They also work directly with breweries rather than through distributors when possible so you know care is taken regarding freshness. If I lived closer, I'd own a "mug".And the atmosphere! Warm. Inviting. Family friendly. Not too loud but still fun and great for groups.  The staff was very service oriented and the chef/owner is constantly circulating the room and ensuring everyone has a fantastic experience.
The rapini here is arugalized in-house, and their delicious pea tendrils are wilted to order. Don't forget to slather the Yemeni skhug on your quatre epices for that extra kick of flavor.Tl;dr: the menu is unrelentingly pretentious, and using inductive reasoning, my party determined all hot dogs are indistinguishable from one another.
The Hog's . . . .is a nice addition to the flourishing Beer Garden trend that is finally catching up to the rest of the USA.  Yet this one the lacks the actual outdoor experience one would expect of a traditional Beer Garden.  Nevertheless, there are many things to like about this one.  Well, of course the beer selections are very satisfactory ranging from imports and domestics on tap.  The food delights wells especially the Terrines or the Hogs Head Cheese and and the Charcuteries.  Nothing too extraordinary here, but the mains and started complement the beer selection nicely.  However, avoid the mostly unsparing sides like the Brussels sprouts,  etc.  More time was put into describing them than preparing them, so theylive on this menu as an afterthought.  The atmosphere is rustic, modern and pleasing ,but it hard to have a conversation here at the larger tables where you nearly have to yell to be hard.  So if you want something quieter and more chatty, sit by the windows.
Good food, great service, but this place is so incredibly overpriced.  $27 for two tiny pieces of fried chicken.  $16 for a tiny salad?  Totally ridiculous.  But delicious.
I'm from San Diego and this is my second visit to the Hog.  Both times I have had an exceptional time!!  The customer service and beer selection are outstanding.  The first time I was there Nicole took great care of this out-of-towner and I knew I had to go back.  Megan in the bar was super awesome and she really knew her beer.  She paired me up with a great beer that I probably couldn't have picked of myself.  After that, Marie, Alice and Christy took over and things were consistently great from there.  The rainbow heirloom was too good to describe in words, so you might want to go down there in person and try it for yourself.  Every time I'm in Oakland Im stopping by for sure.  Thanks for the extra Burrata guys!!  Keep up the good work!!
Returned for breakfast and was thrilled to see the Benedict back on the menu, this time with pastrami. Combined with the schmaltzy potatoes it is just amazing. And as previously mentioned the iced coffee is delicious, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ.
service was ridiculously slow! I swear there was one.. MAYBE two people working and the place was packed! I had the corn dog and I like mustard but that stuff was gross, wayy to spicyoverall just not my kind of restaurant i would recommend going just for a beer due to the large selection but the service would keep from going even for that.
This is my friend's favorite spot so we've eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks and a dozen, or more, times over the last 4 months.  The host and servers are always helpful, knowledgable and accommodating.  They make most everything in house, so they can tell you about all of the ingredients.   This has been super helpful over the last few weeks because I'm doing the Whole30 diet that requires I not partake in a whole host of ingredients (including no added sugar to anything).  I've had the same super awesome server the last 3 times.  She knows what I need and has been incredibly accommodating and helpful in working with the kitchen to help me eat there. My friend enjoys trying different beers and every server we've had has happily help him choose the best bear to go with his meal.  I'm don't drinker beer but they've even helped me find one or two that I like (before I was doing the Whole30).If you're looking for friendly service, good solid food and a great beer selection this is a place you should try.
Beer selection can't be beat, and a knowledgeable staff to guide you thru it.  Menu is meat heavy as expected, and isn't approachable for everyone.  However the flavors are incredible and every meal I've had there has been delicious.  Great location for MacArthur BART and I'll be back soon.
The food is amazing. Large hearty portions, really tasty and comforting. Great selection of beer. The service however has room for improvement - can never seem to catch the eye of the one server on the floor at 7pm on a Sunday (who whisked away our water bottle in an attempt to refill it, then forgot to return it until we flagged her down to ask about the bottle's whereabouts). The squirrely host is no help either - eyes only looking at the silverware he was setting down.
Have now been to Hog's 3 times, and I have been beyond impressed every time. My fancy beer friends are always stoked with the selection of beers on tap. Being more of a wine girl, I really like that selection is as well. Food was DELISH! The summer gems salad was fresh and tasty time. The heirloom tomatoes were also super tasty, and the Italian Sausage KILLED IT. Go to Hogs, go now.
Got there for a reservation at 7:30 pm were seated at 8:20pCouldn't hear or think beyond the noise and music.Fish dish was dry  and bland
Man, this place is awesome!! I came here for the first time a couple days ago and just had to go back last night. I found out about the Hog when I decided to Yelp for corn dog places around the bay. When this place popped up, I bookmarked it and knew that this place was going to be a winner (have you SEEN the pictures of that sucker?!). Located on the corner of Shafter and 40th about a block away from Homeroom, this place is a great location for a quick dinner or to catch up with some friends. During the visits, my girlfriend and I got to try their kielbasa ("Who's your Basa?"), corn dog, roasted peppers, and delicious as all-hell potato chips (that are fried in their own pig lard! Yes!!). The Hog has a hefty beer collection on tap with relatively lesser-known breweries. We met up with a friend and all got to try an IPA with wild rice, imperial IPA, several saisons and a couple of stouts. I don't recall the exact number of beers that they have on tap, but it's a very impressive number considering some places in the area only serve up about 10.If you're coming here for dinner, make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to just sit at the bar, which really isn't bad. The music here is BITCHIN, so prepare to eat good food, drink tasty beer, and groove to some dope music.
Look, I know that as a vegetarian in a place called "Hog's Apothecary" (or "Hog's" anything else for that matter), I have little right to complain about a lack of food options not made from a pig.  So I'll only note here that if you are a vegetarian (or keep Kosher or Halal), you are not going to find food here for you.We only came here for beer anyway, so I'm not holding it against them.The ambiance here is cool-- very Oakland hip.  Lots of beer options, so, there's that.  Greeter and server and person who finally brought our beers were very nice.But I was not that impressed with the beer we had in 2 different flights (so that's 6 different beers--multiple opportunities for good beer), and it took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order once we had sat down.  We actually gave up we were sitting there so long and finally just went to the bar to order there.  The place isn't that big and didn't have that many people, but it seems like they didn't have enough servers for the space, and so our nice server lady badly neglected us.  It's two stars for me on this not because it's a bad place in and of itself but because for Oakland, it's a definite "Meh. I've experienced better."  It definitely did not live up to the hype; neither, for me, did it live up to comparisons/experiences/and-mainly-the-beer of Beer Revolution or The Trappist.But I'm going to guess that if you like pork with random potentially-not-great-beer that this place is going to be the bee's knees for you.  Or the pork knees, as it were.
If you are a beer lover and find yourself in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in here. The extensive (mostly local) draft beer list is impressive and is varied enough to keep the whole group happy. Our group of 4 started standing by the window while we waited for some seating to open up. We then sat at one of the large shared tables in the middle of the restaurant, where we shared a couple bits/starters and two of the house sausages (which are huge). Great/lively ambiance!
Sorry guys! Have always loved the food and amazing draft list but... Chill out on the rules. The last three times we've been there our experience has been soured by weird overstepping of bar/seating arrangements. I've invited multiple guests who've felt snubbed by this. I.e. tonight for my birthday after work our table was approached and I was told we were expected to spend more money on food not just drinks and would have been sat somewhere different. This was an odd and somewhat rude admission in light of each person ordering over $30 in drinks. I appreciate the attempt to keep the most efficient flow going through the restaurant but the second your patrons feel like pigs led through a feeding trough, you've lost an opportunity.
I don't drink beer often but I had a fun time experimenting with the beer menu and having our waitress pick out drinks for me based on my preferences.  The Harlot (a Belgian pale ale) was my favorite, and given that I overheard a few other parties ordering it, my sense is that it's a pretty popular choice.I enjoyed everything we ordered (pork cracklins, meatballs, summer bean ragout and mixed grill) except for the corn dog.  The hot dog tasted overly smokey and burnt to the point where I couldn't really taste the cornbread.  This was highly disappointing because I love corn dogs, but I still recommend coming here for the other dishes, beer selection and attentive service.
After a rocky first visit (nothing to do with the food), I'm now a HUGE HOG FAN. The cod fritters were delicious. The fried chicken rocked our world. Service was charming and I really appreciated the owners reaching out. They've totally solved any service problem they had.
Food:Spicy Pork Cracklin's - Don't get it, it's not very good.  It doesn't taste like "real" cracklins.Belgian-Braised Pork Shoulder - This is a winner.  For $27, you make the value proposition on this one.Choucroute Garnie - It's exactly what it is albeit I was expecting more meat.  I think there were 4 meat selections and more saurkraut.  A great plus is that one of the meats is their duck, which is DELISH!  If I compare it to others that I've tried, this lands on the bottom somewhere (That just means I've experienced tons of kick-ass Choucroute Garnie in my life).Beer:Yeast and Hops Flights - All good.  This place has a great selection of beers and if they curate it as they described, extra kudos.Lowdown:I'll probably go back for the beer and the ambiance.  The food and area, not so much.  I would be here often if I lived in the neighborhood, that's how much I liked my experience.  Some people will say that the food is over-priced, I can see that argument.Recommendation:MAKE A RESERVATION
Love the ambience annnnd it's in my 'hood. I'm going in a hike tomorrow so I wanted something hefty even though I am currently sans meat. So I ordered the Gem &amp; Jewels salad along with the Soft Pretzel. Sooooooo good. Omg, this salad. For reals. Not playing. The softness of gem lettuce, the sweetness of the persimmon, the tang of the pomegranate cut with the slight acidic tang of the crème fraiche dressing... but y'all don't hear me though. I'm sure many have waxed poetic about the pretzel so I'll just say, order it. Their beer menu is extensive and the staff is very welcoming.
I ordered one of the sausage combos and it was awesome. The sausage was made and cooked perfectly, and the fixings, while not terribly appetizing to look at, were perfect along with the bun. The beer selection is great and I can always find something new to try. Despite being busy, service was quick on everything and the manager was also helping out and very responsive.
I love this place. Their detail to their house made food,  fine local beers and wine is amazing. The corn dog is the best you'll ever have. It gets busy and some might say somewhat pricey, but well worth all of it! I've been here several times since they've opened and am always impressed. Thank goodness for fine food in Oakland!PS- they just started doing take-out; I cannot wait to eat a corn dog in bed. Yum.
This is a cool hipster place - love the vibe here.  If you like beer, it is a must.  I am not a drinker but friends enjoyed it here.  The hostess was very friendly to the wait staff.  This is a place to share food and chat with friends.  It does get kinda loud in here and you need to raise your voice to talk at times.  The food is good..we shared 2 sampler appetizer plate and an entree.  It was a good taste of all kinds of pork.  The portions were good..not too small and too overly large..good size.  The prices are decent.  It is nice to have a gastropub in temescal area.  With home run down the block and blue bottle opening near by, I am glad this neighborhood is up and coming with great eats.
This is an awesome place for beer lovers - they just have an amazing selection of local beers on tap. They also have a selection of ciders, which I tend to order. Usually you can grab a seat at the communal tables, but you can also make reservations if you have a bigger party. I've found the food to be a little disappointing, with very few options for vegetarians be warned!
If you are driving to the neighborhood, do NOT leave anything in your car. No bags, no cell phone chargers.  Your car WILL be broken into, and you will not get your stuff back.
Okay, I swear, it took me a while to choose between 3 or 4 stars - I've seriously been going back and forth for about 5 minutes now! We ordered the mixed grill - I believe it was a mix of 3 different meats (a piece of sausage, pork belly/thickest bacon slab I ever seeeen) and a half of a small tiny bird (I think Cornish game hen??)...anyways! 'twas delicious and utterly satisfying. Full of flavor and goes so gooood with the beer!OH YEAH...the beer. that's a whole separate story guys. this place has a FAT list of brewery-direct beers on tap. they are hand-selected and have a variety from all over the west coast. In addition, they're pretty knowledgeable on the beers they offer, so when in doubt, just ask for a suggestion. Now...the reason I gave 3 stars...the pricing. I mean...really, for a small ramekin of basically what we Americans know as "Corn Nuts" you're gonna charge $3 for less than a handful? AND...they're way too hard to chew, they might be better off sticking in a sling-shot and letting a kid have some fun. $6 for a regular pretzel. The plate we got, Mixed Grill...small tiny portions...was wrong for 2 of us to share, but THAT small plate was $28 :/  yikes...Another reason for not giving 4 stars was the attitude of the staff - mostly the hostess, the guys at the tap, and our specific server....so I guess that's the majority. they had this attitude that came off as if they were "too cool" or "too hipster" to help out and serve normal people coming from work that just want a good bite and beer. definitely felt like they're only welcoming to a certain and specific type of crowd...guess you need tats, an old leather jacket and a septum piercing to get the thumbs up for them. it's a shame, because I would've gone back for their food and beer selection...probably on a pay day since its kinda pricey , HAH!
Went by again for an early dinner on Sunday. No wait right at 5pm, but it seemed to get crowded around 5:45pm.This time we had a chance to sample more of the menu and I have to say that I was actually really surprised at how good the food was! I was prepared to support this place based on the fact that it serves good beer and is within walking distance of where I live, but now I can legit say it is worth seeking out.We had:- charcuterie sampler of pork rillettes, liver mousse, trotter terrine ($13 for the sampler of three). Quality: B+, Adesso is way better. Quantity: B, too much of the sides, not quite enough of the main bits, but for $13, it was alright- frisee and arugula salad with grilled peaches and humboldt fog toast ($8 I think?). Quality: A+, this was perfectly balanced and well-seasoned and the peaches were ripe and sweet. Quantity: B, the toast was kinda ridiculously thinly spread with cheese- rabbit &amp; pork belly salad with onion stuff and herb stuff on it, it came with chips and pickles ($14). Quality: A+++++ the sausage was incredible. I was really blown away by how good it was. Served on a nice soft roll that seemed a bit pretzel-like. I've eaten at Rosamunde countless times and I have to say, this sausage blows theirs out of the park. Seems like maybe they've addressed the "okra slime" issue for the pickled veggie side because I saw no okra and no slime. Quantity: B+ the sausage was decently sized but still for the price... B+- side of cheddar grits ($6) Quality: A+ hi I love butter cream and cheese. yummmmmm Quantity: B. come on. it's grits. you could give us more than 1.25 cups for $6.
I've been here three times. Loved it the first two, really disliked it the last.  They've changed the menu: they used to have a great salad ("visions of spring") which still shows up on their online menu but was no longer on offer last Saturday.  The salad I had (which was basically the only option) called the "green machine" was a salty, gloppy mess.  And worst of all, they "ran out" of the soft pretzels, which was 90 percent of our reason for being there. At 8 p.m. on a Saturday night - really??? Our less than helpful server offered us nothing as substitute (some of the potato chips that came with the dinner the people next to us had would have been good to satisfy the salty craving, but we didn't know about them).  And our platter of three different salumi only had two.  I guess they "ran out" of the third variety.  Finally, our "medium rare" ribeye was raw: presumably they "ran out" of time to cook it properly.
We love Hog's Apothecary- relaxed local vibe- great beer and cider selection - I LOVE the Graviva personally - their albeit more limited wine selection works even with their focus on draft and craft beer- food is sophisticated, interesting and the menu is always changing- service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable - they now have added brunch which is awesome :)- to date we have always been able to walk in and get seated - we make reservations about 50% of the time as it can get busy for dinner even early in the dining hour
The beer selection is great and fairly priced but the food selection is not. Well developed flavor with tragically pretentious ingredients. It is exactly what you should expect from a hipster joint in piedmont, $23 for a pork chop. The meatballs were the best thing on the table. Bring your horn rimmed glasses.
Great beer. The staff is very knowledgeable and all I need to tell them is a type of beer I like and they find the perfect match for me.  Love this place. I have not tried the food yet.
I tried Hog's Apothecary for the second time.  The food is very good but the service just horrible.  I arrive famished on Sunday.  Ordered the Clubber.  Food arrived about 30 minutes later and the waitress once again quickly disappeared after dropping off the food.   No apology or acknowledgment on the long time to deliver the food.  No, "Can I get you anything else?"  No follow up with, "Is everything ok?"   Poof - gone.  She delivered the wrong sandwich to me, though my partner's was correct.  Horrible.  It's such a shame since the food and beer is pretty good here, but not good enough to overshadow the down right poor, indifferent service.  Sorry, not going back.
When going to the restaurant of a friend for the first time, one prepares themselves to be polite, offering words of praise out of the sense of duty that comes with being friends.  We caution ourselves not to be harsh or critical and generally keep any negatives quiet.  After all, they are our friends and we'd expect the same.Thank goodness I don't have to keep the negatives to myself...  as I couldn't find any.  In fact, to say I was impressed would be an understatement.Brad and John have taken what once was a dilapidated laundromat with a seedy past and created a neighborhood gathering spot that is open, airy and inviting.  I was at first slightly put off by the long tables and benches, as I generally prefer not to share my table with people I don't know, but I came to realize that it promotes conversation between strangers and contributes to the neighborhood feel.  While the dining area is not huge, the high ceiling with exposed beams and open air skylight make it feel much larger.  "Hog's" boasts more taps than I could get through in a week.  They have beers on tap to appeal to any beer drinker.  They also cycle beers in and out to keep the selections new and inviting.  Now.. on to the food itself.  We started out with the warm pretzel for two with cheese sauce and mustard. ( One thing you must know before I go further.  Nearly everything you eat is made in house.  The mustard, the cheese, the sausage, the kraut...  the exceptions being the buns and, if memory serves, the pretzel itself. )  The pretzel was hot and delicious.  The house made mustard and cheese sauce were the perfect compliment.  There's just no comparison between jar mustard and mustard made fresh that day.  For my entree I ordered the schnitzel.  It's really easy to overcook pork and make it dry.  Not the case here.  The breading was light, the pork juicy and while I used my knife at first, I ended up using just my fork as it was so tender.  The arugula and warm potato salad only served to enhance the succulent pork.  My dining companions ordered the 'Basa' with kraut and the Devil Bird fried chicken.  I was raised by a German mother who made ( and at 70 still makes ) her own kraut. As much as I cannot believe I am saying this, ( Sorry, Mom ) the kraut at Hog's is better...  especially thrown on top of a juicy and savory sausage with just the right pop from the casing.  ( Sorry, Mom ) The chicken was juicy and full of flavor, but it's the breading that really takes it over the top.  It's hard to describe, but there's a slight sweetness to it that, to me, was reminiscent of that first bite of a churro or a Krispy Kreme that immediately makes you want another bite.  It's difficult NOT to want to clean your plate.I do have one regret.  Only one.  I didn't try dessert.  We all surveyed the dessert menu, but after a great beer and amazing food there was just no room.I know I am a friend and friends tend to be biased so I encourage you to read other reviews.  Aside from the small contingent of nay-sayers you will find that the overall rating of 4/5 stars is well earned and well deserved.  It's worth checking out.
A little spendy for what you get, but everything we had was great and the atmosphere and service was wonderful.
We've visited Hog's a few times now.  Every single time, we've received amazing food and exceptional service.  We've left with happy bellies and smiles on our faces.
The food was great, as were the beers.  Unfortunately, the service was slow.  Our server was new, and not super attentive or knowledgeable about the menu.  Hopefully she'll hit her stride...
I guess my main issue with this place is that it is not what I expected.  They bill themselves as an "American Beer Hall", which to me means:- A large craft beer selection (check)- A good, informal place to gather with friends (nope-though the potential is there)- Maybe some inexpensive pub style food.  However, when you walk inside, you are greeted by a hostess and added to the list for a seat at one of their community tables or bar stools along the window counters.  The food is VERY EXPENSIVE for what it is, and the staff projects a major restaurant vibe, but the atmosphere is that of a bar.I'm really not sure what is going on here but its not at all what I expected.For about a year I anticipated their opening and ended up there on the first night they were open to the public.  I've been back a few times, and it only seems to have become more restaurant-y.  One positive thing to say, the beer selection is excellent and the price is right for draft beers.  That said, It's not easy to get in for just a few beers (especially for more than 1-3 people), so I have ended up passing it up when going out with friends even though I live 3 blocks away.I really hope that Hog's will make up its mind, are you an up-scale restaurant or are you a beer hall? Right now you are somewhere in-between and it just isn't working for my demographic at all.
If you're looking for a spot with tons of (mostly) local beers on tap, this is a great spot to visit. Death and Taxes is my favorite beer they have. They also have a small selection of wines if beer isn't your thing. The Grilled Greens starter I had there was meh. It was way too salty for me. I wouldn't recommend it. However, I heard the corn dog is amazing, i will have to try it next time I'm there. The Devilbird (fried chicken on top of some spicy garbanzo beans with chili oil) OMG. So delicious and perfectly spicy. So buttermilky and crispy! I love the fried chicken there. It never disappoints. Service is great there, I've never had any issues with the staff whatsoever. They're always nice and prompt! Also: be prepared to get a little cozy with other patrons, the seating is picnic table style.
Great beer selection, corn dog and hot dog were ok but made in house. pate, rillette were on point. would def come back for some beer and pate.
Kinda shocking to read reviews about how snobby the wait staff was, I found the service to be very friendly and helpful. As for the food and beer - YUM. The food was so flavorful, with fresh herbs and the sauce on the pork chops was unbelievable. Loved it so much, we asked the waitress if we could have some bread so we could sop up every ounce, because yes, we are hogs. The kitchen specially prepared some toast for us so we could lick the plate clean. The beer selection was good, the menu described the brews well and I was pleased with my selection. The interior is pretty cool, but can get loud. Looking forward to returning.
If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! There food and beer is fantastic! They have an industrial feel to them and sure its a hipster joint but that doesn't detract from the delicious food and beer!Recommendations: 1. Butchers coffer. Get all three, every time. Its worth it2. Lil Salty3. Any of their sausagesBeer: 1. The Butcher 2. Tunnel VisionGreat Job guys
Only tried the beers here so I can't comment on food. There was a great variety of drinks and the bartender was so nice to let me try several until I found a beer I was satisfied with. Sucks that its so hard to find a seat here, it seems like they could better maximize their space. Also the lighting in here was so dark. But overall, another trendy restaurant to hang out with friends.
I'm a little biased since it's right up my street, but Hog's is a pretty special place. The rotating taps, solid food, and ambiance are great. Tried their brunch for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. Had the pork belly/beef burger and apothecary benedict at our table and both were very tasty. They also were open to showing the football game our group wanted to watch. Overall, a solid four stars, and my go-to neighborhood bar. Much, much better reason to come to 40th Street than Homeroom.
Hot damn.  We came here for their soft opening, and we've been coming here regularly ever since.  The food: fantastic, inventive, and there's always something new.  It tends to be heavy fare (even the vegetable sides and salads, which will frequently have an egg or lardons), but it's always delicious.  We've tried things from every section of their menu and have never been disappointed (well, I didn't like their collards, but I'm from Kentucky.  The kale, on the other hand, is always amazing).The beer: excellent selection of mostly local breweries.  They generally have good prices ($5-$6, though watch out for the expensive Rare Barrel offerings), as well as a nice balance of beer styles, ranging from pilsners to Belgian Quadrupels, and thankfully not too many IPAs.The service: we've had one or two servers who weren't on the ball, but the regular staff is fabulous, friendly, and knowledgeable about their beers.  I love that the owners are typically around, pitching in.  They're really friendly if you get the chance to talk to them.The cons?  It can get loud at times, but that shouldn't be an issue if you go earlier in the evening.  But that's a pretty minor drawback when everything else is so good.
Just.... meh. Pros: Big beer selectionInteresting menuCool vibeDecent foodCons:HORRIBLE service (waited 2 hours)Overpriced for what you getLoudI wouldn't go back. It definitely wasn't worth the $90+ dollars my husband I spent on a few drinks, an appetizer, and one entree.
I LOVE the food and the beer list at Hog's. The service has always been good to above average in terms of speed, attentiveness and product knowledge. The house made sausages are great, the schnitzel great, the fried chicken so plump and juicy. The beer list has many styles from many great big and small California craft breweries. I would say there beer list rivals any beer hall in Oakland including the Good Hop, Beer Rev and Cato's. HOWEVER, they were spendy, $14 for a bratwurst, when I first started going there 1 year ago and now they are $17. They are served with  some homemade chips and a small pile of pickled veggies. Hog's like everything else in "up and coming" Oakland is darned expensive for modest portions. Beers have gone up $2/pint as well.  I get they have high rent, need to pay employees a living wage and nothing is getting cheaper but my sense is these trendy dining houses are going for it because their clientele will pay whatever they try to charge at a cool place. I'll miss you, Hogs, but $17 bucks for a fancy hot dog and $7.50 for a pint of IPA isn't a good value. 4 stars for beer and food, 4 stars for service and atmosphere, 2 stars for value. Average 3 stars.
Hip neighborhood joint, with the usual trendy, expensive spin. I did enjoy the food, (yum!), and the beer, (good beer menu selection). I'd give the place 4 stars, but the value is lacking. $23.47 for a beer ($5.50), a side of bacon ($6?!) and a Brussel Sprout salad with bacon bits &amp; one egg ($10?!). It's too expensive to make it a regular stop.
My friends and I had a good time. I'd go back.Awesome if you like beer, which we do. Also, beer + meat = amazing. Get the meatballs. Nice atmosphere, a beer hall, kinda romantical, actually. Bummer? The service. Awkward, lackluster.  Although the server didn't really eat meat, they also didn't seem interested in the food or beer. No recommendations or knowledge about either. Which is fine - I believe I was far more excited, and we can both ride that wave. Also, the hostess was strange. If I worked there I'd own it  - its easy to make service industry customers who came to get drunk and spend money happy.  At least at my job it is. This place has so much potential - can you imagine if the service was at the very least  - engaging? It has a casual vibe, but once you see the prices you'll be looking for some engagement, I promise you. Some other random cute staff would come by and be nice and fill water and I was grateful. The beer float is small, but very good.
super excited about this addition to the 40th/broadway area. the service, the foods, the beer selection(!), the ambiance, the space, everything gets an A+!we got sat along the bar that is built around the perimeter of the pub, facing out onto 40th, and we had no complaints. our server was so on top of it, it actually took me by surprise. I'm just not used to someone checking in every 10 minutes, but this is what we experienced. we were not of want of anything... from water to new beers, she was there to make sure we had what we needed. and the place was packed. other highlights - the house made pretzels. GET ONE. the music was perfect, not too loud, but just loud enough that I picked up on one of my fave bands of all time - pavement, then some sonic youth, plus some other 90's-ish indie rock that I was definitely digging. parking as others have mentioned is a breeze. and it's also just a block or two down from the local record shop (1,2,3,4 go records), the cool mens shop - Pine &amp; Elder, etc. so you can get your shop on beforehand if you so choose. finally, I just need to add that I was more than just a little excited about their beer offerings. and I'm not even a huge beer drinker. the two that I tried - a dark chocolatey number  (coffee &amp; cigarettes by CellarMaker) and a local herbal beer that came recommended (a style I never even knew existed but one that I'm kinda dying to sample again!) completely blew me away. this is the stuff I expect from a beer institution like Trappist but not from the new neighborhood pub. yet, hog's is the spot I have a hankering to return to... asap. stop by before there's a line out the door. it's only a matter of time!
It was really tasty! I was very impressed with the beer selection. If I wasn't the one that drove I swear I would have tried at least 5 on the list. My friend and I split two of the sausage sandwiches and both were very good. The atmosphere is very hipster. They have a shuffleboard in the back. The seating is bench style where you'll be seated at a long table, possibly next to really obnoxious people that you have to just try to ignore and talk over and try not to look at and throw death stares over. (If I had that 5th beer I'm sure I would have become best friends with them...)
We feel happy to report we live only ten minutes away and can return repeatedly with no effort. A creative menu with fabulous execution, we have enjoyed everything we have ordered.  The salads and starters are great. We loved their version of a Caesar salad. The sausages are fabulous with homemade chips and slaw, yummy. Their skirt steak and pork chops are incredible.  Let's not forget a large on tap beer menu.   Marvelous find.
First met Tim as he was sourcing his ingredients from local farmers markets, a year ago.  I still see him there today.     Tonight was my first night to visit and eat, and I was not disappointed.  I tried two starters, a salad and two of the sausage sandwiches.  I could go on and on to say how the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sausages burst with complex but not overwhelming flavors, and lard fried chips were crisp and light.   But I won't, and just say that they have a large array of detailed local beers, and they craft their food with thought, care and precision from farm to fork.    Yum!
Yummy breakfast food and great atmosphere.  We called ahead of time to see if the back area was open so we could bring our dogs.  They said yes, but when we got there it was already full.  We sat in the front with our dogs instead and had a great time.  They brought out a little bowl of water for them and were unbothered when my dog sniffed her shoe and leg!  I got the waffle with 2 eggs and bacon and thought it was just perfect.  Go for a relaxed nice breakfast -- can bring your pups!
This place seemed like a cool little spot, in a great area too, but I will never return. First, the service was terrible! There was only 4 of us, but they acted as though we were a large party. Trying to ask for something as simple as a fork was like pulling teeth. Once we were finally seated, two of us ordered a coffee drink off the menu, called a Black and White: espresso with vanilla ice cream. After asking about coffee drinks multiple times, they were finally brought out as we were finishing our food. They were made with really old vanilla ice cream so neither of us could even finish them. As far as my food: my eggs were funny (even though I ordered scrambled) and I ended up only eating the potatoes off my plate. I'm only giving a star because that's the lowest I can give.
Had to try the legendary oatmeal pancake here. Yes, it was huge when it arrived. Yes, it tasted SUPER healthy. It was like they made some hot oatmeal and then straight fried it. I mean, it wasn't bad. I finished mine without the blueberry sauce, but my family really didn't like the poor pancake, even with the blueberry sauce ):The other items we ordered were good, but nothing really stood out to us....Except for the restroom. I love the restroom. The sign above the toilet made me really happy I breakfasted here.
What keeps me coming back you ask? The amazing customer service and how fast the food is served. LITERALLY!!I came for weekend brunch with a friend and found this wonderful find on Yelp! We walked in and noticed that the café spot was packed house! Luckily I went to the counter and asked how long the wait was and she assisted me upstairs where there was upstairs seating outside. I would have never known they had an outside back area but it's so cute and intimate! (I definitely recommend seating outside).Menus are already located on the table so by the time our server came I was ready to order. we ordered the:~Eggs A La Justin- Consisted of two medium eggs, avocado, tomato, English muffin and homemade hollandaise sauce $10~Two eggs-Consisted of any style with bacon, grilled potatoes and toast $9Once we ordered the food we literally waited less than 10minutes and we were being served. I swear I heard my friend say, "Damn, did the cooks hear our order from the kitchen? This food came out FAST!" haha.Everything tasted delicious and the food was VERY filling. I was feeling like a stuffed muffin leaving the restaurant! HA! I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a great weekend brunch. Its small and I am sure it gets busy very quickly so might want to call in to see how long the wait is but however long it is...its truly worth it!ENJOY!
I work fairly close and thought I would give them a try BC some of my coworkers like their food. Ehh not the best, had eggs Benedict... Eggs were over cook as was the hollandaise sauce. Clumpy, cold on the side in a little container thankfully BC it was completely inedible. This would not have been a huge issue for me if there was a large amount of people waiting. But there was not, I went in during a really slow time. Sad. Don't much feel like going back to pay $10 for inedible ,  over cooked cold food
My official go to brunch place! Don't let the small space and old decor fool you. They do brunch here fast, simple, and most importantly, delicious! I ordered a Blackstone Benedict which came with thick and crispy bacon, a slice of tomato, and of course a perfectly poached egg and a light hollandaise sauce. My dish also came with a side of the house potatoes that just needed some hot sauce and ketchup. The food came out so fast and I know it was fresh. Prices are great too! My dish cost $10 and the service was good too. Very nice and attentive servers. They had some specials on the board such as Spud-o-Rama which I wish to try next time! Gotta try this little gem!
Boyfriend and I decided to grab breakfast before a full day of activities.  We wanted a place that wasn't too formal, or too quick (like a coffee shop or a cafe where you order at the counter), but small, not to crowded, homey and easy going. This was exactly what we were looking for.The restaurant is very warm and bright with a lot of sunshine to fill the room.  Though it is small, there were a couple tables open for us to sit at (we came on a Sunday around 9 am). They have an extensive breakfast and lunch menu.  The items weren't over the top, but simple and delicious sounding.  It took Boyfriend and I a bit of time to figure out what we wanted.  I decided to get the Wayne's breakfast and Boyfriend got the avocado omelette. We started with coffee that was rich and warm.  Our food came out so quickly, we were surprised.  Our breakfast was absolutely ideal -- great portions and relatively healthy (as in they don't pour mounds of oil and sauce on the food).  My oatmeal wheat pancakes came with blueberry sauce that was delicious.  My sunny side up eggs were also cook perfectly with a thin film over the top of the eggs. The bacon was really juicy and crispy (if you flicked it, it was stiff not floppy). Boyfriends eggs were fluffy and I think they gave him at least half an avocado or more!We were so impressed by this breakfast joint that it will be THE place to go to for breakfast for us.  The service was very friendly and our food came out very quick.  PLUS everything was pretty inexpensive.  It doesn't get better than this. What a gem :)Ambiance: 5/5Food: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Overall Experience: 5/5
I used to come here and really enjoy the food, not today.  My husband asked for eggs over hard and it was over easy.  Our server's give-a-shit meter was really low.  My coffee was never refilled and our mugs looked disgusting. The Eggs Jacqueline, which was my standby, was watery.  I was excited to return, but this is the last time I'll eat here.  You really need to re-examine what you're doing.  I really liked this place two years ago and something went horribly wrong in the two years since.
Wow! Best brunch I've had in a long time! Service was prompt and attentive. The best mocha and salsa I've ever had (random bests I know)! Eggs Florintine was superb! A little noisy, but it's a small place so that's to be expected. Not great for big groups unless you come early and get the big middle table or else be prepared to wait. Other than that, highly recommend!
I hate to say it... but I was a little disappointed. Oh my gosh. I don't want to say that because all the reviews and pictures looked so good. And I was really excited to find a new place to have breakfast/brunch. We got there on a Saturday around 11ish. We were able to sit down right away, which was surprising. But we definitely came at the right time because right after we sat down, a whole bunch of people started showing up. A lot of the menu items looked really good. But I am a huge fan of Eggs Florentine. So that is what I ordered. I asked to add ham and with my English muffin on the side. And a cappuccino. My boyfriend ordered the Italian omelet. And a coffee. When our food came out, it smelled great. My boyfriends omelet looked good. But he said later on that there was more meat than there was eggs in his omelet. My plate was covered in vegetable juice, which made everything (including my potatoes and English muffin) soggy. My eggs were cooked perfectly. But I could not get over how wet my plate was. The potatoes were okay. They were cooked perfectly but they were a bit bland. I really wanted to like this place. But I was let down. I wanna give it a second chance. And I probably will. But I won't be ordering the same thing again. Definitely gonna try the pancakes and waffles. It looked great when other people ordered it.
Great service! We sat be the window in a booth.  Very chill atmosphere for brunch. I had the benedict here and it was quite tasty with the egg yolk nice and runny. Good portions.
Really nice and quiet Cafe, with a patio! The patio is ONLY opened on the Weekends and Holidays. Waiters are very timely and the food comes in less than 10mins, no joke! The pictures don't do justice: the food looks really good, but the flavor isn't there at all! My grilled chicken and avocado was flavorless as well as my potatoes! I do recommend trying this place out, but you're going to have to add some hot sauce onto your dish!
Came here this morning for brunch and there was no wait! We had to sit on the upstairs outdoor patio area which wasn't too bad because today was warmer than it has been this week. I hope I can come back sometime in the summer and sit outdoors again! We ordered the eggs benedict and the eggs lox. As some of the other reviews mentioned, service is super quick! I would say within ten minutes of us ordering, or food was in front of us! My eggs lox was delicious but there was a little bit talk much hollandaise sauce so my potatoes were a bit on the soggy side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and definitely want to come back and try the other menu items!
Service is Awesome , come early . Got a half an half of buttermilk pancakes and cinnamon French  toast. With warm blueberry sauce . Dip it in and savior the sweetest pancakes...  Full breakfast with all the fittings from lite fair to a full breakfast that can feed 2.  It's all fresh ..
MUST GO TO! Great service, homemade food, and welcoming environment. Really cute family owned business. Specials run around $11.
Omg little hidden gem in Oakland! Good is yummy me service is FAST! Also the coffee is out of this world hahahaha
Charming cafe with outdoor seating located along Grand Avenue. I like coming here for their benedicts, and haven't really tried anything else. Love how they make the toast crunchy, as most places usually has it soggy by the time it comes out. Fast and attentive service. Eggs Blackstone is amaaaazing!
Ordered to go on a Friday morning, the cashier said it'd be ready in 5 minutes... Okay, no problem, they weren't lying about that. I get there, pay for the food, and take it home (1 exit away). The food was on paper plates with foil on top, what the heck?!? At the very least, have some containers or carry-out boxes. That's not the end of it... The food was horrible, it was very bland.           We ordered the Eggs Escapade and Lu's breakfast: bacon looked like jerky, very dry. The eggs had no flavor. The french toast was soggy. The Eggs Escapade had no flavor at all: the tomatoes overpowered everything, so it was very sour. I couldn't even get a taste of avocados and it had a bunch of avocados (that's a plus). Casino breakfast buffets are even better.
The outside looks pretty old and doesn't look open... but it is! I'm a huge breakfast/brunch person, and this place definitely hit the spot! There were a lot to choose from and the food was made really fast (but I went in a little after it was opened). I seriously recommend the french toast for all the carb + sweet lovers out there.
First time going and not wowed but will give it another go.Salmon Omelette - Meh they should add more flavors to it its just eggs and salmon and the salmon was cold.French Toast - very goodEggs Benedict - meh no flavorTruth be told the French Toast saved them and will come back for more.
Great place for brunch! Docking one star because of the noise level. If you're into jamming to clanking dishes in a small space since the kitchen isn't enclosed, then it might not bother you. Food was average but still delicious. I'll add this to my list of yummy weekend spots.
Easy enough to walk in and get a table for two later in the weekday morning or afternoon. I usually get the Eggs a la Justin and it never disappoints. The breakfast potatoes are good and are served with sour cream. Food comes out fast and hot and prices are cheap for good portions. Parking in the area sucks though so be prepared to trek that hill if you're like me and refuse to pay for parking.
Very nice little cafe near Lake Merritt. Service was fast and friendly...I was there slightly after typical breakfast rush on a weekday so it was really chill there.I had the open face omelette which has lots of veggies. It was lightly spiced so I added a few pinches of salt and it was great. They had several daily specials on the board.The atmosphere was nice. I will definitely return.
I came in the early afternoon about 1pm... I ordered an omelet and I was extremely disappointed my toast was stale. My potatoes were stale and dry as well. Usually it's really good but I guess it's only good when the food is fresh in the early morning . Also the guy who took my card rushed me so that made it even worse.
Looking for brunch one morning with friends and stumbled upon this place. I love a good diner style breakfast and this place did not disappoint! I tried the veggie omelet with added avocado and egg white and of course potatoes and it was all delicious! The wait staff was very attentive and our coffee cups were frequently refilled. They have quite a menu and look forward to trying different things each time!
I was wary to write a review of this place, mostly because I don't want to contend with a crowd every time I'm hankering for French toast. That said, I went around 11 this morning and felt like I could take a deep breath in a city that's often crowded to the brim. The service was prompt, the menu was refreshingly no-frills, and the food was absolutely delicious. Portions were generous. I would recommend the blueberry sauce they offer as an alternative to maple syrup -- whole blueberries still inside, and less saccharine than its traditional counterpart.Will totally be back, especially with family from out of town who love to grab breakfast out.
Love Love LOVE the outside patio in the back. So beautiful!! Although FYI there have been two occasions that spiders have FALLEN on my friends' laps. Not the restaurant's fault but just a precaution!! I come here quite often for the eggs benny and the last few times I've been disappointed. Not sure if they changed their hollandaise recipe or what. Bring it back please!!
I didn't want the overly hipster brunch at Grand Lake Kitchen... I felt more in the mood for your standard eggs, bacon, etc. This was a great choice and I was happy with my order whole wheat oatmeal pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon -yum!Service was great, they even let us take our coffee to go. I like that it's a little family owned place. Apparently there is also a patio upstairs, will definitely sit there next time I come back.Cute little gem on Grand if you don't want to deal with long waits and hipster menu stuff. Only thing is their to go coffee cups were styrofoam and that's not very good for the environment.
I love their breakfast... they are really fast and have everything you could want for a traditional big American breakfast, including the diner feel, or the outdoor back patio (also a tiny bit divey) if that's what you are looking for.A good neighborhood jem.
Came in during the week for an early breakfast.  Super easy metered parking right outside on a Tuesday AM.  Always wanted to try Lynn &amp; Lu's.Pretty old place with a lot of character.  Kind of dumpy.  Pretty small place too.  Has the look of a place that's an institution in the town.  Two outdoor tables on the sidewalk.  Eggs, bacon and OJ were fine.  Didn't care for the oatmeal pancake.  Not sweet enough for a diner raised on sweet waffles.  Everything else on the menu looked great.  Specials on the board too.  Good service.  I'll be back.
Small and quaint atmosphere. The employees were happy and easy to talk to. I arrived with less than half my group of 5 yet they were understanding and helpful. I ordered the special, French Toast with blueberry sauce. Yummy!Regarding the check, they allowed us to each pay individually with cash and 2 cards. Very reasonable price for delicious meal.
The pancakes are so fluffy and delicious! The staff is always sweet and friendly. One of my favorite spots.
Nice place, Very friendly, prompt, attentive service. Had egg white name, green pepper, cheese omelet and grilled potatoes. A little weak on the ham, but otherwise good. A nice hole in the wall type place. Worth checking out.
great little diner in oakland.  food has flavor.  I was most impressed how well cooked the potatoes were.  wow, cooked to perfection.  I had the open face egg escapade.  delicious.   ? is would I return?  yes of course.  great waitress to, great customer service and food came out in a timely fashion.
I gotta say... The rating on this spot were wrong. This cute little location is the perfect spot for a nice one to one brunch! The staff is super friendly, quick service, and great food for sure!We showed up around 10:30 and saw there was a group of people outside. You go inside to sign up and they give you a number - which I love since there's no real confusion. We waited about 5 minutes even though we were fifth on the list. Sat down, got a really nice waitress and she took our orders quickly.We ordered the Eggs A La Justin, the Italian Frittata, and got some apple bread. The eggs a la justin were decently good (4/5) but for how cheap in cost they were, it totally put it on the 5/5 list for me. The Italian Frittata was also pretty good but the spotlight was on the apple bread!! Freshly cooked... Made it super warm and soft. So delicious! This is something everyone should get if they come down here.I'll definitely keep this place in mind if I ever feel like returning to a spot I already know for brunch.
Great service, even better food, and a warm, casual atmosphere. I'm certainly coming back!
Chill atmosphere and really fast/friendly service. The food itself is nothing incredible, but it was good.
I guess other people had a better experience than I did. But i was completely ignored from the minute I walked in. There were only 2 other tables, maybe I don't look rich enough or like I'm from Piedmont?? Well I work down the street and would have come here every day but definitely am never going back. The waitress (short asian girl with long hair) served everyone around me and checked on everyone multiple times, I wasn't even greeted until 10 minutes after I sat down! She even rushed past me apologizing to serve an older lady who came in 5 minutes after me. When my food finally came it was okay, but not anything special. Burger was overdone and chewy. Then waited another 10 minutes after getting the check to get change for a 20... Never got change or even a glance, and all i had besides the 20 was exact change and I had to leave to be somewhere, so I'm sorry but she did not get a tip. I always tip even with bad service and if I had had change I would have but I couldn't wait around any longer. Never coming here again, can't believe I was pushed aside for older wealthier looking patrons. I work for a shop that caters to people with money but we give our attention to everyone and do not judge based on looks.
This place was solidly... Okay. We were in a rush and didn't want to give the bougie restraunt our money after a 30 minute wait. It was kind of cute, a little dated but kind of family run vibe. The food was just kind of bland and uninspired. I ordered the eggs escapade which boasts having a whole bunch of spices. I found none. The cheddar was mild. The potatoes were alright, not amazing. My toast came dry and I had to ask for butter. That being said, the service was REALLY fast and the food was relatively inexpensive. Until they charged me 3.50 for a cup of drip coffee!! And 2.50 for iced tea!
I come to this brunch spot frequently and I'm always amazed by their quick and friendly service. By quick, I really do mean that your food is ordered AND ready within 10 minutes! My fav dish is the Benedicts a La Justin with a side of bacon - u should order it if you love avocado and bacon as much as I do! oh and don't forget to request for an outdoor patio seating on a sunny day. :)Lynn and Lu's... I'll see you again soon!
::Food::Been here twice so far and both times food was pretty good! I especially love their egg Benedict. ::The place::Their customer service was just okay. During my second visit, they forgot our drink order yet still charged us (they did take it out at the end though, after we asked them). The place itself looks really tiny from outside but they actually have more patio seats in the back, which I love. However, there still seems to always have a long long wait... and parking on Grand can be a pain.
SERVICE IS FAST ...friendly and the food is awesome....especially the pancakes with blueberry sauce.
I love going here for breakfast. I don't know how they can always get the food to the table so incredibly fast. The food is delicious and the staff is extremely nice.
Worst breakfast I've ever had.Eggs Jacqueline was swimming in water.  Ummmm I didn't order spinach mushroom soup!  This was suppose to be poached eggs topped on spinach and mushroom with cheese.  Literally, swimming in water.BF's dish: spinach mushroom omelette...Eggwhites were not even cooked thoroughly.  Did they stick any random person in the kitchen to cook?  Very very disappointing.  Let's not forget the toast that tasted like it was from yesterday's service.Overall restaurant environment - DIRTY!!! So if restaurant is dirty, that must mean the staff is DIRTY...gross!Would never eat here AGAIN!
Eggs benedict was to die for!  This place also has an intimate dining area in the upstairs backyard which was so lovely to sit and bask in the sun while eating.All in all the food was amazing. Friendly staff and great prices. I can't wait to return :-D
I ordered the lox Benedict and French toast. I was pretty disappointed to find that my eggs were both pretty raw when I cut into it. The eggs were extremely runny (not the way a poached egg should be).  The potatoes were soggy as well :( The French toast wasn't fluffy but it was flat and dense tasting.   Most likely never coming back again. I had better else where.
There's a reason why they call Oakland The Town... the cutest parts of it have a small town feel to it that's just hard to find in SF. This place is a great example of it - it's in a bustling part of the city but it's all mom and pop charm, from the minimal decor to the amazingly friendly and enthusiastic servers. i was thrilled to see oatmeal pancakes on the menu, but alas - they're just not as fluffy and delicious as regular, unhealthy pancakes. A good way to get my sweet breakfast fix in without feeling too guilty, though! And I loved the blueberry sauce that came on top. Other than that, the best bet is to go with classic breakfast items here, like eggs and bacon and omelets. Nothing crazy, nothing fancy... just what I like when it comes to going out to breakfast! I'll definitely be back every time I visit friends in the area!
Maybe I came the wrong day.. Everything was great but the ham in the Western omelette was horrible.  The potatoes, eggs, coffee, service were all excellent just like the  previous Yelp reviews.  But the ham was so thin and it tasted like it was of inferior quality.  If it had not been for the ham, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.
Affordable breakfast entrees and hearty portions - I enjoyed the food here and will come back eventually.  Service was mediocre but no real complaints.  I ordered the Spudorama with cheese and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict; usually breakfast establishments do not give generous portions but this cafe does not adhere to that trend.  Everything was good but there was something missing tastewise that would have made my entree undeniably delicious.
What a nice little place! We went today and were not really expecting to get a seat right away - Labor Day rush. But all was good and we got a nice place outside on their patio. The wait staff was a bit stressed, but that was no wonder because the house was full. That said, service was fast and friendly. Food was good and portions were big. The bacon could have been a bit crispier, but that's really the only thing that was not 100% good. We paid under $30 for two with two breakfasts, a side of bacon and two drinks. All in all a nice experience and we will surely be back!
I cannot see why there are not more five star reviews here. From seating our group of six right away to quick service, to food so good we were all sharing off each other's plate to taste the awesome.I shall return!
I was craving for an Eggs Benedict and found this place on Yelp. I decided to try this place out one morning. The service was very fast. We got our food in less than 10 minutes it seemed like. The portions are huge, and my order was definitely delicious!After I put in my order I noticed the specials on the wall. Such a shame. The description of the specials looked really appetizing. Maybe next time! Otherwise, this is a cute restaurant just above Lake Merritt. Parking may be difficult during certain times in the day.
Came here on a Friday morning with a few friends. We all had breakfast omelettes. I had the California (added bacon) and the oatmeal pancakes. Deliciousness!!! Service was excellent, doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a great little place to check out.
One of my co-workers came up to me one Monday morning and told me she wanted to show me something. She is this cute older German woman and told me she took a picture of this place to show me because it was an excellent eat near where I live. She was right. I went for the first time this Saturday when my parents visited with the family dog. We were happy that there was outside seating so little Heidy could join us. Right away I could tell that this was a family run mom-and-pop sort of place that had an intimate and welcoming feel to it. My parents both tried the Eggs Jacqueline. It was a spin off of Eggs Benedict with fresh mushrooms, spinach, cheese, and their own homemade sauce. Of course I took a bite and it was amazing. It is apparent that they have fresh produce and make everything from scratch. I had the BLTAvo, which is a BLT with avocado. I asked for mine on sourdough because it came with wheat and I didn't really feel like wheat at the moment. It was great and fresh. All of the dishes came along with grilled red potatoes which were flavored with rosemary and served with plain yogurt. The service was prompt and attentive and the food came pretty quick. I will definitely return and try something new.
Went here yesterday (Saturday) around brunch-time. Wasn't too busy, which was nice, so my cousin and I were able to get seated right away. But note that the place is kinda small, so your table might be pressed up against someone else's table - so hopefully that doesn't bother you. The staff was friendly, but were not always available when needed.The food was okay. Shared the Italian fritata omelette and one of the specials, a waffle with strawberrys, bananas, and blueberry syrup. While the food was good, I didn't think it was anything particularly unique. The waffles were very similar to what you'd get at other diners - not better or worse. The Italian fritata with sausage was fairly good, particularly the use of salsa, but despite that, it seemed to lack flavour.
This cafe looks like a great place to have late breakfast, but after looking over the menu, I decided to get a burger instead. No regrets whatsoever. That burger was juicy, the bacon crispy. Thumbs up.
I don't really know how this place got as many good reviews as it has. Maybe I visited on an off day, because the service was really bad.We arrived and were given a number? That's right, a number. This might not seem weird at first blush, but in a restaurant setting where a bunch of people are standing around waiting to be seated, this causes a lot of issues. This is probably why every other place takes people's names? The host would come out and call numbers out of order making many people think they had been skipped. They were of course filling tables based on the number of people in the party and so they had to skip numbers and come back to them. I never realized how good a system this is at the butcher's but how bad a system it turns out to be in a cafe setting. The host seated us at a table out front of the cafe. So, we got to listen to people frequently ask, "Did you skip x number?!" So, I wasn't the only one scratching my head. Beyond that, when the meal was finished, they took my credit card and I had to request they run it and give it back to me. The food was decent and came out quickly, but I think the poor service eclipsed anything the kitchen could have pulled off. I guess it is busy because it is only one dollar sign on yelp?I think the wait staff were not regulars? I saw one of them collide with a door she was trying to push rather than pull.It is rather ironic that I had the opposite of this same issue at La Farine on Fruitvale the other day. At that La Farine location I think they are in desperate need of a number taking system. Odd how that one decision plays out in my ratings.
I ate here for the first (and only) time recently. Clearly, it's a beloved spot in the neighborhood--the place was steadily packed for Sunday breakfast. While waiting to be seated, my friend and I stood at the bottom of the staircase at the rear of the restaurant, rather than hover over seated diners in front. And then I saw it: the tub of hollandaise mix on a storage shelf. Any expectations I had of a great meal vanished on the spot. Even though I knew they don't make their hollandaise from scratch, I went ahead and ordered the eggs benedict. The eggs were poached nicely, and the potatoes were pretty good, but on the whole it was, as expected, unexceptional. And why wouldn't it be, with a flavorless, un-lemoned hollandaise sauce? My friend seemed happy with her meal, but the side salad it came with looked like your basic lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes. It would have been nice to see some quality mixed greens on the plate. Nevertheless, the servers are friendly and eager to please. They kept my friend's coffee cup and my water cup full. Also, I used the bathroom after the owner vacated it, and I could tell he had just washed his hands at the sink, so at least that practice is observed. Three stars, just barely.
The waiter was really sweet and the cook was nice too. The French Toast is very average. Plain jane wheat slices, dipped , not soaked at all, in half scrambled egg and and cooked on griddle that was too hot. I don't think was cinnamon like the menu said.  There were 8 pieces to make up for it though. My friend had 3/4 cup of potatoes and an egg and a sausage for $11 before tax and tip. Hmm. The potatoes  were crisp and yummy. It was empty that day because construction was going on street side. I wouldn't go back unless it was really last minute or really convenient. Three stars for average. Really nice people though.
I came here the 2nd time because I remember my first time here was pretty gosh darn good.  It's a simple brunch place.This cute little mom and pops kind of diner serves yummy food at reasonable price.  The service has always been great and I've only sat at the booth right at the window.Here's what I've ordered:Cinnamon Rasin French ToastThis came with bacon and eggs!  Both were decent and I had asked for a side of blueberry sauce that is housemade.  It was delicious!  The french toast i thought was generic but not bad.Eggs A La Justin BenedictThis is pretty much eggs benedict but with avocado!  This was absolutely delicious!!!  It came with a side of potatoes was yummy.I'd defintely come back here.  I really enjoy a breakfast mom and pops kinda place :D
My very dearest Oakland friend had taken me to Lynn and Lu's Cafe a few weeks ago and today I had the opportunity to bring some guests there.We had previously eaten in their small but sunny pleasant outside cafe and we enjoyed pancakes and sausage.  The coffee is superb!Today it was chilly and foggy but we were seated right away and the staff, as always, were very attentive to feed us coffee and juice right away.Today we ordered the Country Italian frittata and a daily special which included potatoes, pesto, sausage and cheese. Lynn and Lu's is definitely a great place for breakfast and thankfully walkable from any place around Lake Merritt.  The people have managed a great place and they really know how to make you welcome.
Okay, when you're working with customer service, you do not rudely say "what?" every single time you don't hear what a customer says. Talk about manners! Not to mention he didn't hear my sister order a piece of toast, instead of asking her twice, he went to his coworker and asked her to take care of us instead. Uhhhh these kids are lucky my mom left a tip! The waiter seemed unexperienced. He was very rude about taking our order as if it was a burden that we were there. If you're putting someone unexperienced on the floor, at least give them a proper training. I've been coming here for years and this is the second unpleasant experience I've had due to customer service. If I'm paying $9 for a plate of food I expect decent service...I ordered an eggs blackstone and a fresh orange juice. The "fresh orange juice" was clearly not "fresh". It tasted like Tropicana and looked like Tropicana... I wouldn't order it if I knew it wasn't fresh squeezed. The eggs blackstone was OK. My poached eggs were perfectly cooked but the hollandaise hardly had flavor. The biscuit was waaaay too buttery for my liking and I never thought I'd say it, but there was way too much bacon - it was overpowering. Overall, the dish was good, but it could've been more balanced out with flavors. I understand it's a mom and pops restaurant but the people here need to learn something about customer service before they lose more customers - especially the local regulars. At least smile upon greeting us! Gees louis! Three stars for the decent benedict and overall appearance/environment of the restaurant. But terrible service, I hope they improve.
Wow. Yelps popularity has a down side, almost 500 people can be wrong. First off, drinks.  The water. It tastes like burning, what ever window fluid that is shouldn't be consumed.   I ordered a soda, which wasn't bad except I hate ordering a soft drink and there is no indication its a can until it arrives.  Just note it on the menu so I can make an informed decision. FOOD -  yikes. My wife ordered the eggs benny with spinach and mushrooms. Forget what they label it. IT CAME IN A SOUP BOWL! There was so much liquid in the bottom it needed the bowl. I AM NOT referring to hollandaise sauce. There was some strange soupy liquid in the bowl? The mushrooms were terrible and the entire dish was utterly tasteless. The poached eggs were done well. Should also be noted the potatoes looked good. I ordered the "Lynn", to be fair it doesn't say Belgian waffle, and it isnt. Leggo my eggo is more like it. My over medium eggs were done well and Bacon was not terrible.  Service-  weren't too busy so service was prompt. The young lady that took our order seemed very nice. Overall. I stick with the 1 star just a completely different story than the yelp average will lead to believe. Eat with caution; its not 4 star in my world and isn't even close.
One of my friends and business partner turned me on to this place. I'm not sure I would have noticed it on my own. I love the unique vibe, very chill. The food is amazing! If you love breakfast foods this is your spot! Those potatoes with everything on them, pesto, tomatoes and all sorts of goodness! My mouth is watering now as I recall all the yummy flavors.
So, it's been a while since I've been here and don't remember it being this good before? I'm pretty picky about restaurants becasue I was a waiter, bartender and know when the service is bad or the people are having a bad day. Neither happened today. We sat on the the patio out back, the staff was super nice, our food came our fast and It was delicious. This is going to be my new breakfast spot. You should def. Check it out. :)Jes
Ok
STAY AWAY!Talk about service. This place is the WORST. The waitresses have an attitude and one of them is still drunk! In a 20 minute period, they lost 8 customers including us.So they lost 8 plus 6 of us and they did not care!We even tried to explain to the manger and the snotty bastards blew us off. Dont care how good the food is..if your service sucks..STAY AWAY!
It's rare that I give 5 stars to anything, and I never give 5 stars to casual dining restaurants, but this one has broken the mold.For value, taste and speed of service this place is incredible. I was speedily seated and my order of Eggs Justin arrived in less than 5 minutes: hot, fresh and delicious.  The Eggs Justin are two perfectly brown and crispy halves of an English muffin, topped with tomato, two thick, perfectly ripe halves of avocado, poached eggs and a delicious hollandaise.  I have never had any version of eggs Benedict in which the English muffin was so perfectly crisped and brown.  The poached eggs were PERFECTLY cooked, the beautiful yellow yolks breaking open to lap redolently over the creamy avocado goodness and buttery  crispness of the muffin.  I defy any vegetarian to not fall immediately in love with this egg dish.  The breakfast potatoes-- so often a  throw away in even the best restaurants-- were amazingly seasoned; I think I detected basil, rosemary and oregano.  I did add some salt to my plate, but every one has a different palate when it comes to eggs: the salt just brought out the simple and delicious flavors.  The coffee was actually pretty decent, too.
The wife and I popped in on a Saturday morning, looking for a good ol' brunch place and we were intrigued by all the good reviews.  We came around 11 and told it would be about a 25 minute wait.  The place has a homey feel (but a little chaotic with people running around everywhere- not the quietest place) and a nice patio in the back that has additional seating.I ordered the Willy's omelette (chicken apple sausage, provolone cheese, green onions) and the wife got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  My omelette was pretty tasty and a good value for the price.  It also came with potatoes which were so-so and a couple slices of toast.  We were a little disappointed with the eggs benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was a little runny but overall, it wasn't bad.The service was friendly and pretty attentive and the prices were good for the amount of food we got.  I've definitely had better breakfasts but this place wasn't bad.
The fastest service, amazing brunch food and specials! The best omelette and homemade salsa in town!
This place is one of those classic "hurry up and buy" Chinese Restaurants Fast in,and fast out. I don't mind that type of service when it comes to my local Chinese joint, but not for breakfast.You're quickly seated and the food does come out pretty fast, but it lacks quality and flavor. If you're in a hurry and fine with food that's just average, then this is the place for you.I gave this place two stars; one for being fast, and the other for being edible.
Prompt and friendly service. Delicious food and ample portions.Everything I look for in a great little breakfast or lunch joint.Love the California omelette. Lots of avocado. Mmmm.
Solid, I've meant to go to Lynn and Lu's a few times but it's small.  This particular weekend they had space inside!  Sweet, I and two former co-workers met up for brunch.We were seated promptly, get some water and shortly later the waiter came back for an order.  We needed a few minutes, and they came back a few minutes later again and we placed our orders.  Everyone got something with eggs, I got a veggie omlette with fruit on the side.  The food is a decent value, the staff is prompt, and the food tastes good.  Also, it's in Oakland a nice central location.  What isn't to like?I suppose you could find fault with the older interior or that it gets really busy in here.  Still, considering what is is I'd come back.
This unassuming joint on the west side of Grand Ave just above the lake rocks the house and takes down the competition! I actually felt bad for the empty bakery breakfast option right next door.Everybody definitely got this place right---indeedy, cheap and delicious. Props to my fellow kinsman who can run such a great place...greasy spoon without the heaviness of cheap ingredients. $8 for a humongous breakfast that incl. 3 egg omelette, toast, and grilled red potatoes--opted for Willi's cuz I'm a sucka for chick app sausage (many, many great breakfast options).I came today for a late-ish breakfast amidst a day of appts and errands, and was so satisfied with them. Didn't need to eat again for at least 7 hours. Turnaround time was great, and no need to wait! Love finding this cafe....diamond in the roughPS never availed myself of the back patio (for the slower pace) but I was on mission to complete the to-do list for the day (type A that I am); patios are great for al fresco and just automatically relaxes one to 'feel' the outside!
Came here for Breakfast on a Sunday morning around 9:30ish with four others. We were seated right away.Atmosphere: Cute and tiny. It's nothing really fancy, but I've heard it can get a little crowded around brunch time.Food: I was conflicted between sweet and savory. Luckily, my friend agreed that he would get the Eggs A La Justin and I would get the Pancakes with Blueberry Sauce and we would share. Probably the best idea since in the words of Hannah Montana, "you get the best of both worlds" (yeah, I just went there).If you are a fan of avocados, the Eggs A La Justin will be your calling. The use a FULL avocado with this eggs benedict. Overall, it was pretty damn delicious, but it is kind of heavy - I would not have been able to finish one order on my own. The pancakes were some of the best I've ever had - super fluffy and light. And the blueberry sauce was a nice sweet touch. So good man, so good. Everything is reasonably priced especially considering the delicious quality and quantity of their food.Service: Quick and friendly.I wish I knew of this place while I was living in Berkeley.
Love this local spot!Round 1:It was during the weekend for brunch and boy was it packed! Lucky us, we got a table on the patio out back. A nice breeze, sunshine, and FAST SERVICE!The food is delicious too. I had the eggs lox and Jason E. had the spinach and mushroom omelette. Both are hefty portions with those home fried potatoes. DELICIOUS!The staff is really friendly too. They check up on you just enough.Round 2: Friday morning bright and early. We ate inside this time. It was quiet and mellow. The patio was not open, but no worries.Jason got the eggs lox this time and I had Lu's breakfast, the French toast. The raisin bread was good, but the execution of cooking the French toast was not so good. I really don't like it when the egg in the batter just looks like egg cooked onto the bread. It doesn't taste so nice. The bacon is super yummy (yes put syrup on it)! I wonder what should I order next time?Thanks Lynn &amp; Lu!Until next time, happy brunching!
Read as 3.51.  Diane and I met here for brunch this morning.  It's a sweet old school place w/ bench seats at tables in the windows on either side of the front door and tables and chairs on both sides of the room.  There's a sign on the screen door stating that parties would not be seated until everyone was there, but the restaurant was mostly empty at 10:30 on a Friday morning and they invited me to take a seat.  Diane joined me a few minutes later.  We looked at the menus and there was a lot that was interesting.  Diane ordered the Benedict w/ avocado.  I forget what it was called but it was gorgeous, w/ what looked like a whole avocado divided between the two English muffins.  She requested the hollandaise on the side and didn't use it.  She likes her eggs poached medium/hard and these were a little underdone for her taste, though they would have been a bit hard for mine.  She had coffee and said it was good.  I had tea, Twinings, which was served w/ a small pot of water in addition to the water in the cup.  I ordered Lynn's Breakfast, which was a waffle w/ two eggs any style and bacon.  I was offered the choice of maple or blueberry syrup and opted for the former.  Each component of my breakfast was good.  The waffle was tasty, the eggs, which I had scrambled, were fresh and good and there were 4 pieces of bacon cooked nicely.  It was basic, but it was good.  Diane wasn't interested in returning, but I think I'll introduce Alan to it one of these days and see what he thinks.  Prices were very reasonable.
They've really upped their game recently. It's cool to see a good restaurant get better. I ordered the Lu's Breakfast (cinnamon french toast,  blueberry sauce, two eggs, four strips of perfectly crispy bacon) and was much impressed.  Just the right amount of yumminess without being greasy like in the past. Service is very attentive, my coffee never went empty. They must be brewing better coffee too, because this was not diner coffee, it was good stuff. The addition of the back patio seating area keeps it from feeling overcrowded now too.  Nothing more i could ask of this place. Five stars! I'll be back more frequently now.
We also came here due to the high reviews.  Food is just so-so.  Some dishes were great, others were awful.  I feel bad for giving them just 3 stars because the service was good and friendly.  They're also a locally owned business.Wait time was about 15 minutes on a Saturday morning.  It was chilly, so we waited in the back of the cafe.Here's the rundown on the meal:Coffee: very weak and smoky flavored.  Seriously, they could easily do better.  If they hired more help &amp; got an espresso machine, it would more than pay for itself.  Hint, hint!  I did appreciate that they gave me a small pitcher of soy milk.  Awesome!Orange Juice: sweet and freshly squeezed.  Great job!Eggs Benedict: nicely cooked and topped with a delicious Hollandaise sauce.  Potatoes were tender, a tad undersalted, but easily corrected with ketchup.  They were cut into large chunks, not crispy on the outside.Oatmeal Pancakes: Unless you're a health food nut, stay away from these.  And I LOVE oatmeal of all sorts.  Like another reviewer mentioned, the texture is quite off putting.  It's like eating the end of a whole wheat loaf of bread, but a bit thicker.  Not quite as tough, but dense and slightly dry.  There is a prominent "wheaty" flavor.  Comes with a warm, watered down blueberry sauce.  I like whole wheat bread, but I had a difficult time eating this.Side of bacon &amp; eggs: My scrambled eggs were perfect.  The bacon (regular American style) was crispy, hot, and delicious.  Bacon was one of the things they did exceptionally well.Prices are reasonable, not super cheap, but worth it if you're too lazy to cook breakfast at home.  Not fancy food, just fresh regular food.  The place is packed and loud.  There is cool local art on the walls.  A neat experience overall.  Know that it's not gourmet food, order carefully (get the bacon!), and you won't be disappointed.
This place wasn't bad. We would definitely go back, but I wouldn't do the Benedict again. The hollandaise was a too runny and not enough. We did get one pancake though to split and not having had a pancake in years. It was awesome! We will be coming back to try out some new items!
Great little hole in the wall! Had the runners breakfast and my boyfriend had Wayne's breakfast. Both came out fast and were delicious!  Coffee was pretty good as well. We will definitely make this a regular spot for breakfast!
An escapade it is! From undercooked eggs with deli meat and raw peppers omlettes to flavorless potatoes, this meal was meh with a side of sad. The cappuccino was unadventurous as well, however we experienced quite the escapade with someone else's drink as we watched the waitress take a sip as she carried it to prevent it from spilling. Ew. But I guess that's the name of the game when you come to Lyn and Lu's Escapade Cafe!
One of my favorite spots for brunch! Egg lox's is my fav. I do wish they served grits tho. Small mom and pop feel. Prices are cheap and the food comes out fast, they have 2 bench like tables near the window that I like to sit at facing grand. Owner is a very nice man, who takes pride in satisfying his customers.
Super speedy service- if you are hungry come on overi love this place! after moving to oakland this was one of my happy discoveries. the place is reasonably priced, the service is top notch- quick and efficient, and the location is just above lake merritt where there are plenty of little boutique shops you can check out before or after.i recommend trying their specials. there are of course the brunch staples but i like coming in and checking out what's new. if nothing new strikes your fancy then have a classic eggs benedict. :)until next timecheers!
Love the patio upstair I came here last saturday!! Lovely breakfast I got the eggs lox and my friend got a eggs florentine!!! Dont forget to check out specials on the board! Will come back and try the huevo ranchero and whole wheat blueberry pancakes!! Service was okay I feel sorry for those servers they walking up and down the stairs like crazy!!! Nice little place def.go check it out guys!!
The staff was great!  Friendly courteous people.  Several people came by to make sure water and coffee cups were always refilled.  Smiles around. The menu had promise but the food was ok.  The ingredients didn't quite go well together to create something flavorful.  For example, the omelette had cheese, bell peppers, and mushrooms, which sounded like it would be good, and the portion was big, but it was a watery mess.  There were way too many green peppers in that dish.  I had the eggs florentine, and that was a watery mess too.  The spinach and poached eggs were sitting on top of the water it was cooked in or leached out or whatever, but it was not appealing.  Still, I'd come back if I want basic no fuss breakfasts.
Nothing any different from a typical, ordinary breakfast-serving restaurant. No problem with being seated, the service, or the food. Someone below wrote, "Good, but not super amazing." I concur, but will put it, "Not super amazing, but good." :)
Three of us went there based on yelp's 4 star review. We ordered vegetarian omlette and 2 French toast, beacon n eggs n potatoes. All of us were disappointed with the food. They were bland and tasteless. Two of us ended up going to another restaurant to eat again.
Do you like quickies &amp; instant gratification?If you answer "yes".. then come to Lynn &amp; Lu's because service here is fastforwarded:- there was no wait to be seated- coffee delivered within a minute of ordering- food arrived within 5 minutes- the check arrived a few minutes after the food arrivedSeriously, I highly dislike waiting and saved time &amp; money eating here than at other 4 star brunch places in SF. As for the food...Eggs benedict a la justine: 3.75 stars: simple &amp; clean tasting with perfectly poached eggs, a chunk of fresh avocado &amp; slice of tomato all on toasted English Muffin. Pancakes w/ homemade blueberry sauce: 3 stars: sweet &amp; with real blueberries in the sauce. The pancake was probably something you could make on your own, but the sauce was good and for the price (just under $5 or $6)- it was a steal.
My boyfriend loves this place. Seriously--loves. Possibly loves this place more than me. He'll probably have a heart attack when he sees that I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5. But when it comes to breakfast food, I'm rarely blown out of my mind. Perhaps upon trying more dishes they will earn their last star--they've got potential, that's all I can say.But the more important point--ASIAN PEOPLE CAN MAKE BREAKFAST? WTF, MATE? Oh yes. Yes they can. Didn't know that until I went here. And from what it looks like, seems like they can bring in a non-Asian clientele. That's pretty impressive to me.So far we've ordered: a meat omelet (can't remember which), eggs benedict, potato escapade, and another special that had bacon, eggs, hollandaise, and tomatoes. By far the best is the potatoes escapade... who would have thunk that PESTO can go into breakfast? Seriously. Cheese + pesto on just about anything will make me go nuts. Their specials menu alone is worth coming back for. And coming back, yes I will... as long as I can keep the bf when we're done eating.
I really enjoyed this mom and pop breakfast dig.Waffle looked like an Eggo but tasted bomb!  Thought I'd get 3 strips of bacon but got about a dozen.  Legit.
Service and food were stellar when a couple friends and I had breakfast here. I can't think of another way I would prefer spending a warm and sunny morning than from the back patio of Lynn &amp; Lu's enjoying some hot coffee and perfectly poached eggs.
Pretty standard eggs &amp; bacon spot.  Little pricey.  I had the BLT on a bagel, which was pretty damn good.
My fav is Lu's special. The French Toast is amazing. Bacon Bacon Bacon!!! When i'm feelings sinful on a saturday or Sunday you'll know because i'll be outside relaxing.
I have had this place bookmarked forever. The hub and I set out this morning for brunch and finally came here for our first time.Time: Saturday at 10AM.Location: Off Grand, easy to find and parking can be difficult especially on the weekends.Place: It looked small and dark when I first walked in. It was very busy inside. We were asked if we wanted to sit out on the patio which we decided to do since it was a nice day. Lots of seating on the patio in the back. I would opt for the patio seating since the dining room looked jam packed with people.Menu/Food: Lots to choose from they have their regular weekly breakfast options and their weekend brunch menu. I ordered the Willi omelet which was 3 eggs with chicken apple sausage, green onion and cheese. I asked for egg whites. Their breakfast/brunch plates all come with grilled red potatoes and your choice of toast. I subbed my toast for the apple coffee cake which was $1.00 extra, well worth it. The Hub ordered the frittata which is their open face omelet that takes up the whole plate with tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese and green bell peppers.  The food was good, the portions were large, the ingredients were fresh and the only waited 10 minutes we were very surprised how fast it came out. We both agreed that the potatoes were a little on the bland side it could use a little more spice. We used some hot sauce and ketchup to help give them some flavor.Price: Most of the menu is around $8.00-$10.00. Our tab was $18.05 with two meals, extra charge for egg whites and coffee cake. Not bad at all and worth coming back to.Service: The waitresses were great very attentive with refilling our waters and asking if we needed anything through out the meal. We didn't feel rushed and they wait until you are finished before putting down the check. I hate receiving the check with the food.
Lynn and Lu's Cafe is a really small cafe hidden near lake Merritt. This is what you call a hole in the wall. Once you walk in, there is a little tiny eating area with maybe 10 tables. However, they have a "patio" area located in the back of their store that you can sit at with maybe 15-20 more tables. The chairs and table outside are really ghetto rigged. The table top are two pieces of wood put together, so when you push down a little, 1/2 the table rises up. The chairs are the white plastic ones which really clean or anything. The service here is one of the best i have EVER had. They are SO fast and prompt. They are always ready to get anything you need. The food comes out almost instantaneously, but not fast to the point where its like fast food. In the patio they have their own mini kitchen in the back with drinks and utensils which makes it easier for them when you need something, versus them having to run back inside to get it. My dish that i ordered was honestly REALLY good. I had the Eggs Benedict with a side order of pancakes which i shared. Both were VERY good. The pancakes had a crunchy layer on the outside which made it taste even better. The eggs Benedict was absolutely exquisite. The flavor, the sauce, the English muffin, everything was just so fresh and tasted so great. Other orders on the table apparently wasn't so great. I tried some of my cousins dishes, and they didn't taste as great as the Egg Benedict, which was by the way only 8.95! (rough estimate, i forgot). They don't have hashbrowns here, however they have their house potatoes, which were pretty good, but could have used some improvements. I felt like they could have had a more crunchy outside moist inside. The potatoes were almost like mashed potatoes, very mushy. The price here is really cheap. Almost all the dishes were under 9 or 10 bucks. No where have i been has Eggs Benedict for under 9 bucks. Appearance 2.0Service 5.0Food 4.0Price 4.0(Out of 5)
Good but not super amazing. It's a very quaint place, food comes out right away. I had the spuds orama with Italian sausage and that was good. Sister had Lynn's breakfast and it was ok. If you're a foodie, you won't really be impressed but if you're looking for just a cute and quaint brunch place - this is it.
I like this place.  It's good, it's cheap, it's quick, service is prompt and nice.  Nothing too complicated or over the top.  The 3-egg omelet with Avocado and cheese is my favorite.  Perhaps because I get here before 10 AM, there's never a wait for a table, another reason I like Lynn &amp; LuLu's. (That's what I call it!) $21.00 without tip for 2 people with coffee.  The eggs are probably not organic! It's kind of a greasy spoon, except the food isn't too greasy and they don't do things like pre-butter your bread. You can be somewhat healthy here if you must. The coffee isn't that strong, but there's lots of it, poured for you by a sweet young hardworking Asian girl.  I find the disparaging remarks about this being a Chinese owned business offensive and possibly incorrect.  Not sure, don't care, just get me my food!  The seating is very cramped and sometimes you have to sit really close, if not right next to a party at a 2-top beside you, beside some other party, who might consist of a little boy in a booster seat and his Mom.  The last morning I was there 2 people were on a blind date on our left. They didn't seem to hit it off. The art is very strange in here, it makes me giggle, and the decor could use an update. New wallpaper wouldn't be a bad place to start. They could also stand to replace the screen door and clean the windows in front.  Seriously, the front door is painted wood, and it looks like the Dickens.  It would make someone more OCD than me want to slather Purell on their hands. I could seriously bump this place up to 4-stars but I don't want to mislead people about our humble neighborhood cafe.  Props to Frankie for taking me here for the first time 4 years ago. It's like the Pete's Egg Nest (of Seattle) in Oakland.
Went here for brunch with a friend recently and was pleasantly surprised. It was a beautiful day out in Oakland, so we decided to sit outside on their back patio. I really liked it out there and it was a very quaint atmosphere. Service, price, and ambiance definitely 4 stars. Food was about 3.5 for me. I ordered the Eggs a la Justin (that's my partner's name so I felt extra inclined haha) and I really liked that it came with a good size portion of avocado. However, the hollandaise sauce was watery compared to other times I've had a benedict. My friend ordered the Italian Fritatta and it was huge! She could only eat half before she threw in the towel. I had a bite and the egg was good, but the veggies seemed a little greasy. Overall, a really good experience and with huge portions for the price, I'll definitely be back next time in the Lake Merritt area!
Tripping down memory lane @ Oakland's Lakeshore District, we found this spot. Great, friendly service, the food was EXACTLY what I wanted to eat! The space is cramped but cool. The beer selection is right on. Superb!
LOVElovelovelovellove their food but not very handicap friendly. I was a regular here when I lived in the area and will drive out and deal with Grand Ave parking to eat here. So, yeah. Its worth it. Service is great and the food is outstanding.
This place is a great hole in the wall, breakfast and brunch spot. Perfect for when you want a delicious and hearty hangover brunch, but don't want to wait or pay to dine at a trendy East Bay spot. I've never had to wait in line to eat here, which is always refreshing. The food is home-style cooking for sure and the atmosphere is super casual. I always order the same thing- Eggs Benedict a la Justin- I can't bring myself to branch out and order anything else because it's always so satisfying. This place is easy on the wallet, which is always a plus. My one critique would be their potatoes. Not flavorful enough. Def need a good deal of hot sauce and ketchup to make up for the void of flavor.
Took the girlfriend to an early morning breakfast for the July 4th holiday. We were the first people to enter and had choice of seating but couldn't seat in the window side booth reserved for 3 or more... uh, the place is empty but ok... expecting a big rush I get it. The service was lackluster and barely acknowledged. It shouldn't have happened considering we were the only ones in the place. The coffee? Gross, tasted burnt and bitter. Ordered the Eggs a la Justin. Beautiful poached eggs with a mediocre hollandaise sauces. Served with potatoes which were cold and lacked flavor. Over all the experience wasn't  all that.... there are many breakfast places nearby that I would gladly pick over this place again.
WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE THIS PLACE?  I am so confused.The dishes were overpriced, and not that good.  I had the famous Huevos and was like, wtf?  I thought this was supposed to blow my mind (mind was blown with CONFUSION)Service was abysmal.My really nice/kind boyfriend agreed, and he hardly has anything bad to say about anyone/anything.  We came here due to the high reviews, but will not be coming back.
Principally, the staff and the shape / decor of this (literal) hole in the wall make me almost a total fan.  On a block with the recent appearance of corky-fakey restaurant bars, Lynne and Lu's luncheonette is 1. unpretentious 2. adorable, and the food is decent tasting and cheap 3. It's staffed by a l-o-v-e-l-y possibly Father-Daughter team, and two extremely personable cooks (who are visible over the counter)....It looks a little like a (yes, slightly run down) dollhouse room-- enlarged! The waitress and owner are simply so sweet, they make one feel sort of celebratory over a grilled ham and cheese with free side salad. My friend had the sandwich, I had fruit (some of which was cut from way too close to the rind. Cheapness!), a side o' cheese, and ala cart YUMMY salad. I was charged a little for extra dressing(s). Neither of us had drinks, but I still felt really good about the cool $20. check.
When it's a rainy Sunday, you're craving bacon, and you've already taken your houseguest to your usual breakfast joint...what do you do? You ask on your status update on Facebook for suggestions.You ignore all said suggestions, and consult Yelp.You remember this place from a brunch date with your girlfriends, and although you can't remember the menu to save your life, you come here anyway because you don't remember it being horrible.I should point out that I'm a big fan of McDonald's McGriddle sandwich, even though it most likely has more calories than you ate all through your (anorexic) senior year of high school.  Just kidding, kids, I was only anorexic for half of the year.This place has the healthier equivalent of a McGriddle- Lynn's Breakfast: waffle, eggs and bacon.  The bacon was not great, but it's bacon, so you really can't go wrong.  Eggs over medium were fine, and the waffle was thin, which is nice because Belgian waffles can just be too big.  The houseguest had a frittata. and it seemed to handle his hangover well.  Prices not too shabby, but I really wish these places would upgrade on the coffee.Cons:  It is tiny, and we were sat right next to the "kitchen," after waiting for what seemed to a bit, it would have been nice to get a less crappy table.  Other than that, not bad, although I don't know if I would take an out-of-town guest here again.
A cute little space. Tables for two along the side walls and a line of 2-tops in the center of the room that was being used as communal dining.The g/f ordered the smoked salmon omelette with bearnaise sauce and I got the Willi's omelette which is chicken apple sausage, scallions, and provolone cheese. Both are off the Weekend Brunch menu.Lynn &amp; Lu's definitely gets props for the size of the dishes. The 3-egg omelettes, potatoes, toast, and wedge of orange filled the plates edge to edge. I really liked the potatoes. They were nice and moist and the dollop of sour cream was just right. The omelettes were also well stuffed with their respective ingredients.Volume of food aside, the omelettes were just OK. The smoked salmon omelette was a little boring with a nice pile of smoked salmon and nothing else inside. The bearnaise on top didn't add too much to it. For the Willi's, the provolone cheese was a big 1.5" x 4" and third of an inch thick mass of cheese literally exploding out of one side of the omelette. It would have been better more evenly distributed throughout the omelette. The eggs were nice and fluffy in both.Service was friendly, efficient, and young. I felt like I was being served by my high-school aged niece and her BFFs.Food 3+ starsService 4 starsOverall 3.5 stars
Don't get me wrong, this place had some wonderful service and felt like a nice, neighborhood joint. The prices were affordable. I can see why people like this place but was surprised (and not in a pleasant way) after reading all the ratings. Maybe we just ordered the wrong items but we went for brunch. My poached eggs over spinach and mushroom was just disappointing. The poached eggs were fine but underseasoned. The spinach and mushroom though sauteed were in a bowl of broth (I don't believe that was intended) and tasted like something I make once a week at home. My SO's brunch plate consisted of home fries and an omelette with some cheese and other things. It was okay. Because of the price and atmosphere I would likely go back on a lazy Saturday or Sunday especially if it's a nice, sunny one, but otherwise will probably look elsewhere for some affordable brunch options.
After spending some time at the Victory Garden on Lake Merritt I REALLY wanted a classic breakfast with some eggs and bacon. I'm new to the Adam's Point area and haven't seen any diners by Lake Merritt. Afraid my boyfriend and I weren't going to find a diner on Grand, we continued past all the cafes and Asian restaurants and happened upon Lynn &amp; Lu's Escapade Cafe. It was really crowded, the couple of tables outside were already taken and it looked like all the tables inside were taken too. Except for one table for two! We grabbed the seat and were given menus promptly. (I later found out there was a patio in the back for more customers to sit at! Next time I come here I'll have to check it out!) I ordered the Eggs A La Justin, which is an Eggs Benedict but instead of ham a HALF of an avocado...And you get two of these guys so you're really given a whole avocado! All their egg breakfast specials come with country potatoes, so I nommed on a side of those too. I also had coffee, which tasted a little burnt, but it wasn't so bad that I didn't want to drink it.  The boyfriend had Willy's Omelette, which came with slices of chicken apple sausage, green onions, and provolone cheese.  It looked good, but I'm not an omelette fan and didn't try any. Overall, very good tasting food with big portions. Both our dishes were $8.50 so for the price I feel you get more than you pay for. Service is a little hectic, but very friendly.
omg very excited about this place, wish I lived closer. I had the potatoes escapade, which was everything I love on top of potatoes (another thing I love) and I added 2 eggs on top. The only thing that grossed me out was the stomach churning amount of oil/butter at the bottom when I finished my plate. It was worth it though.The outdoor balcony area is sort of charming in a run-down cottage type of way. There are some steep stairs leading up so be careful.Was very surprised to find out it's owned by asian people!
BlackstoneIt's the bud of a flower which makes my experience at Lynn &amp; Lu's Escapade Café an enjoyable one. The typical acidic taste of this bud is lost in the cooking process and replaced with a creamy texture similar to avocado with a hint of green. The combination works surprising well with the hollandaise sauce and the poached eggs (which look like cream puffs).  The incorporation of artichokes into Eggs Benedict is a must if you eat, have a pulse, drink water and/or breathe air. Artichokes are serious underrated vegetables which can be transformed and made to please the large spectrum of taste buds we've been given. If you are in love with Artichokes (as I am) and would like to know more about its awesomeness check out wiki's info.  WallsHave you ever been to the little cafes of Amsterdam in which you could sit back and smoke "tobacco"? The cafes are usually housed in old buildings with high ceilings and chipping walls. The tables tend to be small, the room cold and the view none existing. No? Me neither... but I have seen many French films (Amélie &amp; The Professional) to know what I'm talking about. In Paris (&amp; Amsterdam) I would be known as a spécialiste. Lynn &amp; Lu's Escapade Café has the feeling I described above. The walls tend to be covered in local art that is usually bad, not framed and tagged for sell with post-its. I get that we must support local artists, but let's only support good art that enhances the ambiance. I say "good" art because I took an art history class at Laney eight years ago and...I know art. FinI return to this café because the food is good, affordable, the service is quick and the staff is attentive. You should check it out.Notes:Artichokes: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar… .Movie: Ameli, imdb.com/title/tt0211915Movie: El Professional, imdb.com/title/tt0110413
I love a brunch place that has no waiting, quick service and good food.I hail from the city of angeles, and it's hard to find a down to earth brunch place without all the snot nose people sitting next to you in their designer duds and mind numbing conversations.I came here on a Saturday afternoon and did not have to wait for a table. We decided on the eggs lox, an omelet and fritas. It must have been a mere 5 minutes later that our food arrived nice and hot. The coffee is not that great, think Denny's status.Good portion size and the price was even better.I'm use to paying about 15 dollars for eggs benedict but this was about 9 dollars and just as good if not better than what I have had at other places. This is nothing that makes you go goo goo gaga over, but more so if you want something close to home-made but you're just too damn lazy to make it yourself.
Tasty breakfast. Surprisingly busy for a Monday morning, but nonetheless the service was on point and the chow was yum and in great supply. Had the oatmeal pancake +blueberry sauce and a nice chicken sausage, tasted the huevos rancheros too (they're good!). We will definitely return, especially since Lynn &amp; Lu's is within easy walking distance.
I used to come here after running racing around the lake with the Lake Merrit Runner's &amp; Striders club on every last Sunday of the month. Bottom line, this place has charm, fantastic friendly service, great selection of breakfast plates and the food is excellent. I've had Justin's and Escapade, both very tasty and good size portions. And it's super affordable. Love supporting mom and pops shops too.
Came here for lunch today after reading all the good reviews but sadly, I wasn't too impressed. I got the Eggs Jacqueline, which is two poached eggs topped with Meunster cheese, all over a bed of spinach. Well, there was just TOO much cheese on this thing! I normally can't wait to devour any kind of breakfast plate but this looked really unappetizing.Not going to give up though because the pictures others have posted look delish - I'll just get something more traditional next time, like Eggs Benedict (don't know why I didn't order that in the first place anyway, I always get that wherever I go).For about $8 a plate, it is a lot of food though! Service is very good too. Plus they're Asian, so 3 stars it is (started off at a 2).
Cute little place that reminds me of the cafe I used to work at in San Francisco.Me and the guy had breakfast here. Great service, alright food. Menu was impressive.I had an omelet without cheese or sour cream while he had a scramble without sour cream. Our requests were granted without screw-up, but my omelet was swimming in grease. Potatoes were nicely spiced. Wheat toast was well-toasted and thin.Prices reasonable. No big complaints.
Returned to an Oakland favorite, a great way to start 2014!  The Oatmeal pancakes were as good as I remembered, with the option of blueberry or maple syrup.  Eggs mixed with spinach, avocado, tomatoes onions and cheese were yummy.  Potatoes were perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned and the chicken apple sausage was a good complement. Came in on a Friday afternoon, so missed the weekend crowd, service was quick and pleasant.  No AMEX.
I will forever remember this place as the diner with the sticky tables and the bad Hollandaise.
I give my people's props for their tasty breakfast and attentive service. It's nice to see a Chinese-owned business doing well. Cheers my Sugah-peoples!!!
I was excited to try this place after reading many positive reviews - but really, it was just "Eh, it's ok" rather than "A-Ok" - however, I'm adding the extra star because the wait staff was just so darn friendly and outstanding. I LOVE breakfast and for me it's an easy meal that is kinda hard to mess up...but here's why I won't be going back: 1. Bacon. I'm picky about my bacon. This was way too thick and undercooked (even though it looked well done - it was super chewy). This may work for some - NOT for me. 2. The "home potatoes" had a weird non-breakfast type seasoning on them. Maybe rosemary? I think they would have fit better as a dinner side. It totally clashed with the breakfast flavors. 3. Pancakes. I ordered them "well done" and they came out well...rubbery. I drowned the suckers in the warm blueberry sauce (which is great, BTW) and that was pretty much the bulk of my meal. My eggs were a bit on the greasy side. 4. Hubbs ordered the Eggs a la Justin...we didn't understand the appeal. Poached eggs shouldn't be THAT underdone and the flavors were a bit too exotic at 8:15am :-( If you're looking for "gourmet breakfast" on a shoestring budget - this is the place to go! It's small inside, but the food comes out quickly and the staff is super attentive - never had to ask for coffee refills. BUT...I just wanted good-ole basic breakfast, so it didn't really work for me...I guess I'm boring like that ;-)
