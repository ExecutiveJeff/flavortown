BEGIN NOW let's do brunch. END
BEGIN NOW best brunch spot in the city, you can't even get there on the bus. END
BEGIN NOW i can't, i'm in an uber right now. END
BEGIN NOW A truly tasty burger requires no secrets; use only fresh ingredients, prepare them to order, and serve it as promptly as possible. END
BEGIN NOW  This one was delivered as promised on a soft Firebrand bun with pungent Point Reyes bleu cheese and sweet caramelized onions. END
BEGIN NOW  I opted for mine to be grilled medium-rare and to be spared the mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW The kitchen at GLK did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW  My goodness was this sandwich delicious! Augmented by perfectly seasoned French fries and an ice cold pint, I relished every bite while dining outside overlooking Lake Merritt, enjoying the company of my girlfriend and strangers that were seated close by who all felt as strongly about their selection of entrees as I did mine. END
BEGIN NOW They told me that that a total remodeling of the place had just been completed three days ago. END
BEGIN NOW  So I guess I'll just have to come back to check that out at brunch someday soon. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm already looking forward to it already. END
BEGIN NOW I'm torn because the food was inventive yet pedestrian in execution. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs Bennie is my fave and go to brunch meal. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the yardstick of a good spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Again,  torn. END
BEGIN NOW  It was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW Innovative- check. END
BEGIN NOW  They replaced the English muffin with rye bread, presumably from Acme, and the fruit with an salad with a nice vinegarette. END
BEGIN NOW   Score!. END
BEGIN NOW Execution- the eggs came out over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  They should've never come out of the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  They have just re-opened after a major reno and people are swarming like bees. END
BEGIN NOW  I put this down to the kitchen getting used to the new flow. END
BEGIN NOW Staff- totally saved their bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  Really. END
BEGIN NOW   The hostess is very gracious and adept at empathizing with customers. END
BEGIN NOW  It takes a special person to get people excited for an hour wait by sending them to the farmers market and making it convenient to check in. END
BEGIN NOW   I sat in essentially the serve area for the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartender made it the best seat in the house. END
BEGIN NOW  She is very thorough and attentive in her job. END
BEGIN NOW  Her mimosa was delish. END
BEGIN NOW Trouble is the crowd and a need to turn tables. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch is supposed to be, or at least feel, leisurely. END
BEGIN NOW  It was fun but I can see myself relaxing there. END
BEGIN NOW I absolutely love this spot. END
BEGIN NOW I was looking for a good brunch place not in SF and found Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  The restaurant is pretty damn small but if you can ge. END
BEGIN NOW t there at a good time, the wait isn't terrible. END
BEGIN NOW  It's also nice that the lake is right outside so you can just hang out if the weather permits. END
BEGIN NOW My friend and I ordered the Savory French Toast and the Pork Belly Hash. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't rteally remember the hash, because the savory french toast was SO FREAKING GOOD. END
BEGIN NOW  The flavor combos here just worked so well. END
BEGIN NOW  So well, in fact, that I ate here a little over a year ago and I'm just now writing the review. END
BEGIN NOW I was also recently introduced to chilaquiles, which I see is on the menu here, so I'm making it a goal to return sometime soon!. END
BEGIN NOW No wait at dinner time. END
BEGIN NOW   Thoughtful food prepared with love and care. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice breeze on the patio and lovely alcoholic and nonalcoholic drink options. END
BEGIN NOW   I will be back for brunch to see if it can live up to the hype and long lines. END
BEGIN NOW This is by far in my top three places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW   I've usually just picked up a sandwhich, but I went for breakfast and has just a full on delicious meal. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a little chilly, but they provided blankets, which actually made the experience a little more fun. END
BEGIN NOW The coffee is just right. END
BEGIN NOW   I got the soft scrambled eggs and it was just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   My dad got the oyako egg salad open faced on rye and the eggs had such a different flavor and texture but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW I just love the flavors here. END
BEGIN NOW   The portions are perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   And I absolutely loved the staff. END
BEGIN NOW   Whatever they're doing just keep doing it. END
BEGIN NOW   Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW 30 minute wait for brunch on a Monday? Must be that good, eh it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for my birthday with a few friends, and we all shared what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD: I had the chilaquiles since it was highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW  Personally, I didn't like how soggy the chips were and the salsa lacked flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Out of the two dishes my friends ordered, oyaka and savory French toast, the savory French toast stood out for its unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  There is actually no French toast involved, just toasted rye bread for the base, topped with arugula and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  The oyaka was an open faced egg salad sandwich topped with chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend liked it, and I thought it just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  But honesty, it's hard to mess up an egg salad. END
BEGIN NOW DRINKS: We shared a pitcher of POG mimosas, which were perfect for the hot weather. END
BEGIN NOW OVERALL: I might come back to try out other things on the menu, but will stay away from the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW What a lovely spot. END
BEGIN NOW  My beau and I went here on our last day in California, and to check out the spot as the friend we visited is the manager. END
BEGIN NOW  Most of the seating is outside (until the expansion is completed) but it was a nice enough day so we plopped down and ordered. END
BEGIN NOW I had the strawberry French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  My boo had the eggs Benedict with toast, a side of greens and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  Our meal was so amazing!! Some of the best eggs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  They were light and fluffy yet moist and cheesy without being over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  The French toast was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Lightly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Fresh strawberries, whip cream and yummy maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW It hasn't even been a month since our visit and I already miss the food. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're in the Oakland area, do your mouth a favor and swing by this spot. END
BEGIN NOW 4. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm falling more and more in love with Oakland each time I visit, especially this area around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Such gorgeous views with hip things to do, like brunch! I randomly searched for brunch places around here, and Grand Lake Kitchen was first on the list. END
BEGIN NOW  My boyfriend and I put our names on the list, took a brief walk around Lake Merritt, then came back just in time for our names to be called. END
BEGIN NOW We were seated on the outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW  It was a warm Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect for brunch outside. END
BEGIN NOW  What a lively vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Much different from having brunch in San Francisco, I'd say. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Pastrami Benedict which was served on rye bread. END
BEGIN NOW  so unique and tasty! Lots of cool things on the menu, whether brunch, lunch, or snacks. END
BEGIN NOW  My boyfriend got the Pork Belly Hash which did not look as appealing as the Pastrami Benedict but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Inside the actual restaurant seems more narrow, but you get to see the chefs work their magic, which is pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall it's definitely worth the trek to Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  They have an excellent selection of meats that you can't miss!. END
BEGIN NOW Got here around 11 and didn't get seated until 11:45. END
BEGIN NOW  Be prepared for that wait!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is tiny! But the food is great and the Bellinis are pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the savory French toast and would recommend adding the prosciutto as I went without and kind of felt it was lacking. END
BEGIN NOW  I did love that the savory French toast had arugella and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  Yuuuuum! Plus poached eggs were cooked well. END
BEGIN NOW  One was slightly over done but didn't affect the dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW Friend ordered the soft scramble and it looked. END
BEGIN NOW  basic but tasted pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW Although a tiny spot along Lake Merritt, Grand Lake Kitchen is truly a gem! I stopped in for a late breakfast/brunch and I would highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW  Although it's tempting to sit inside at the counter and watch the chefs work their magic, the umbrellaed outdoor patio gives a beautiful (although a touch away) view of beautiful Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Although we visited on a Monday late morning (note: they're closed all day Tuesdays!), there was a steady stream of people waiting for tables throughout our visit. END
BEGIN NOW We started with a bottled rose lemonade (although it isn't made in house, I always order a Fentimans soda when available) and a hibiscus cleanse (more sour than I expected but different in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW  From there we ordered the dungeness crab appetizer, served on toasted bread with avocado and topped with fresh greens. END
BEGIN NOW  This was truly a spectacular dish, the crab was amazing and the flavors combined perfectly and were crisp and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect appetizer to split between two people. END
BEGIN NOW  For our main course we ordered the Italian sandwich, which they cut in the kitchen for us and served on two plates, a nice touch, with a pickled vegetable on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  The ACME bread that it was served on (as most of the sandwiches are served on) is spectacular, sandwiches delicious meats, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  You will not be disappointed with this pick from the menu!. END
BEGIN NOW Grand Lake Kitchen is a restaurant that, if I lived in the area, I would return to over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and I've heard from others positive things about so many dishes. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a place where it'd be easy to explore the menu and always want to order something new. END
BEGIN NOW  They also sell a variety of specialty products in the restaurant, including Durham, NC made Big Spoon peanut butter (shout out to my home city!) One note: they don't accept American Express here. END
BEGIN NOW This is my favorite brunch spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  You have to get there early though, there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW  I think the wait is worth it! The front patio is great too, it's right across from lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  I love the pastrami eggs Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW  The pellinis are super good too! Even if it's cold out, sit on the front prior. END
BEGIN NOW  They will give you blankets to keep warm. END
BEGIN NOW Cheers to Yelp again for helping me find a delicious brunch place. END
BEGIN NOW  My bf's favorite meal of the day is brunch so off we go searching for one when I found this place. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm assuming they're expanding since there's construction going on next door. END
BEGIN NOW  Great if they are!. END
BEGIN NOW Seatings are limited but we went on a weekday so snagged a table right away. END
BEGIN NOW  Love their outdoor seating area that is across from Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Great place for a full belly then cross the street to walk it off. END
BEGIN NOW We order the Savory French Toast and Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  Great house coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  Would have been nice if they came by to check on us and refill it without asking. END
BEGIN NOW but waitress was a sweetheart so all good. END
BEGIN NOW SFT was delicious! I failed to add on prosciutto and it was still rich with flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Wouldn't think that of just toast, eggs, arugula and cheese but the combination with the herb oil and sauté wild mushrooms made it a worth-order dish!. END
BEGIN NOW Now to the Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW I love Mexican food but can't bring myself to like it for breakfast/brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  It's my personal taste so don't take my word for it. END
BEGIN NOW  BF thought it was good but not exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe. END
BEGIN NOW only maybe if they give you an option to add carne asada or al pastor. END
BEGIN NOW now that would be my type of a brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW Short and sweet:. END
BEGIN NOW "Deli-style" old-school restaurant feel. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was everything I've heard about it being. END
BEGIN NOW  We had the savory French toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't be scared, homie. END
BEGIN NOW  It was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been hearing about it for months. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything it was supposed to be. END
BEGIN NOW Friendly, attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW With a beautiful view situated right across Lake Merritt, this place is in a perfect spot to sit back on a Sunday morning and eat some delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a 20 minute wait and none of us minded when they handed us some mimosas and coffee so that we could sit in their outside patio soaking up some sun. END
BEGIN NOW   Lucky for us, the weather was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  Warm enough to take off our jackets and grey blankets draped on the chairs in case we got chilly. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get to the most important part of this experience and talk about the food. END
BEGIN NOW    Because that's what we care about the most right?  Here you go folks, straight from the menu right to you. END
BEGIN NOW *CRAB TOAST - DUNGENESS CRAB, AVOCADO, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPER VINAIGRETTE, SOURDOUGH 14. END
BEGIN NOW 00. END
BEGIN NOW   Yessss. END
BEGIN NOW  Generous portion of crab meat, salad greens and perfectly toasted sourdough. END
BEGIN NOW   Couldn't get enough of this stuff. END
BEGIN NOW   It was so good that had they given us a bigger portion, I would have kept stuffing my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW   Not cute. END
BEGIN NOW *CHILAQUILES - TORTILLA CHIPS, SALSA ROJA, BLACK BEANS, 2 EGGS SUNNY, AVOCADO, QUESO FRESCO, SOUR CREAM, PICKLED RED ONIONS 12. END
BEGIN NOW 00  I'm going to be in the minority and say that I wasn't impressed with this. END
BEGIN NOW   The red sauce was bland and nothing about this stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW   Wouldn't order it again. END
BEGIN NOW *SAVORY FRENCH TOAST - RYE BREAD IN PORCINI BATTER, 2 POACHED EGGS, WILD MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, ARUGULA, HERB OIL 13. END
BEGIN NOW 00  Savory French Toast?  Talk about first time for everything. END
BEGIN NOW   I was glad I got to pop this cherry because boy oh boy. END
BEGIN NOW   This was good. END
BEGIN NOW   The french toast itself was slightly crunchy on the outside, seasoned with a pinch of salt. END
BEGIN NOW  The rest of the ingredients were the perfect accompaniment. END
BEGIN NOW   Pancetta on top gave it a nice salty kick and we practically inhaled this entire plate. END
BEGIN NOW I have to add in that their bathroom was immaculate. END
BEGIN NOW   If you've read my other reviews, you know how much I appreciate a clean toilet bowl. END
BEGIN NOW   Good job Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   You have impressed me. END
BEGIN NOW perfect for wkend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are the best. END
BEGIN NOW   we always come here for these. END
BEGIN NOW we've tried some benedicts. END
BEGIN NOW and it was good too but Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are something really special about this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW all servers are super nice!!! Thank that I can start my wkend morning pleasantly w these great food and awesome servers. END
BEGIN NOW THEY ARE BACK AND THEY BETTA!. END
BEGIN NOW Bigger inside more seating with a bar! Same amazing customer service and delicious food! Love this place so much I always leave happy and stuffed. END
BEGIN NOW People who have read my reviews know that breakfast/brunch is my least favorite meal to eat out. END
BEGIN NOW  Mainly because I'm always underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW  I've yet to find an amazing brunch in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW Grand Lake Kitchen has been on my list to try though due to the great reviews and alluring photos. END
BEGIN NOW  Since me and the BF were free on a Thursday morning, I decided to give it a try!. END
BEGIN NOW There was no wait, but we decided to sit outside since it was nice and cool. END
BEGIN NOW  They gave us blankets to keep warm, which I thought was a nice touch!. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the chilaquiles and the savory french toast. END
BEGIN NOW  It was my first time having chilaquiles and I wasn't that impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Soggy chips, coquita cheese and unseasoned black beans. END
BEGIN NOW  The scrambled eggs were soft but lackluster on their own. END
BEGIN NOW   Ample amount of avocado! I felt like everything was on the bland side and I needed to use salt on everything (which I usually never do). END
BEGIN NOW  The savory french toast was interesting and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the mushrooms! But I found the huge amount of arugula to be a bit much. END
BEGIN NOW  Portions were decent size. END
BEGIN NOW  However, it wasn't a WOW dish for me either. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, I found both dishes to be just okay. END
BEGIN NOW The service was really friendly and attentive though, checking up on use to make sure we were good since we were the only ones sitting outside. END
BEGIN NOW The search continues. END
BEGIN NOW Extremely cute brunch & lunch place in Oakland near Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  This spot is kind of small and crammed, but the food is fresh and not too greasy. END
BEGIN NOW  My partner and I split the breakfast sandwich and ordered a side salad with roasted chicken. END
BEGIN NOW  The breakfast sandwich was delicious and I especially loved the acme bread it was on. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread was soft and not too hard and it blended well with the eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  We decided to substitute the ham for bacon at a $1 extra as I am not a fan of ham. END
BEGIN NOW  The salad was pretty good too and the dressing had a mustard vinaigrette dressing. END
BEGIN NOW I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try the pork belly hash which is only served on the weekends so I will definitely need to be back when I'm in the Bay Area again. END
BEGIN NOW  They also sell chips, spreads, bread and some other groceries on a shelf near the entrance. END
BEGIN NOW Grand Lake Kitchen is/was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I have no complaints about the food or the service. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I don't think it warrants the rating it has on here. END
BEGIN NOW I had one of their recommended sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW  It was good, but it was nothing to write home about. END
BEGIN NOW  If you decide to eat here, the portions can be small, so you may have to order side dishes. END
BEGIN NOW There are a couple of things I have on repeat at this joint. END
BEGIN NOW Because they don't have a ton of veggie options. END
BEGIN NOW French toast with oven-toasted blackberries? Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Huevos rancheros? Good but not Mexican enough (calm down, I'm Mexican, so I have license to say that). END
BEGIN NOW Red potato salad? Good. END
BEGIN NOW Obama sammie? Great:). END
BEGIN NOW Usually love brunching at Oakland Grill around the corner; in fact it's my fave spot in Oakland to brunch hands down but decided to try something different so we tried out Chop Bar instead. END
BEGIN NOW Ordered the pork belly hash, it was absolutely delish, hats off to the chefs. END
BEGIN NOW  Also ordered mimosas, it was meh. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend wasnt impressed with this place however the ambience more then made up for it. END
BEGIN NOW  The interior had a beautiful layout woodsy country theme with a modern twist. END
BEGIN NOW  Decided to try the outdoor sitting, just perfect for a summer day. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice cool breeze and the opportunity to people watch :). END
BEGIN NOW 2 stars for the servers, they were not friendly, lacked enthusiasm but I didn't let that ruin my vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Check out this spot when you're in the area!. END
BEGIN NOW Decent place for weekend brunch in a casual, relaxed setting. END
BEGIN NOW I opted for the eggs Benedict, which was pretty good - the Hollandaise sauce was nice and smooth and the eggs were cooked perfectly, although the English muffin was a bit tough. END
BEGIN NOW  I also enjoyed the Bloody Mary with bacon, which had a good combination of saltiness and spice. END
BEGIN NOW Service is not the most engaging, but adequate for the prices. END
BEGIN NOW Friendly service, chic-industrial interior, so-so brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW The pork belly hash left something to be desired. END
BEGIN NOW  so says mi amigo. END
BEGIN NOW And the Eggs ala Cazuela with Veggie Mojo? Well, first let me translate that for non espanol speakers- eggs baked in roasted tomato-pepper sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Now for my review of that dish. END
BEGIN NOW  En espanol- Es ok. END
BEGIN NOW  In English- It's okay. END
BEGIN NOW Two eggs swimming in tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Soak up the sun (of sauce) with roasted potatoes and 2 small slices of acme bread. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel a side salad or some greenery would've spruced things up- evened out that sauce, carbs, and eggs dynamic. END
BEGIN NOW  Hello, Salt. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW The laid-back vibe and open window seating creates an enjoyable atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  Close to Jack London square (not near the water but in the warehouse area), Chop Bar is a 10 minute walk from the Lake Merritt bart stop. END
BEGIN NOW  I hear their oxtail poutine fries are good, so I'd get that if I came another time. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems like a fun place for a happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW I've been here twice and I have yet to eat anything that I would reorder. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks, however, are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW The bacon bloody Mary is tangy, spicy, sweet and robust. END
BEGIN NOW  Do yourself a favor and get a group together for brunch and order the Bacon Bloody Mary. END
BEGIN NOW  Your taste buds will appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW isited on Valentine's Day!. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't too busy yet since we came early. END
BEGIN NOW  Food was aiiittteee. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the polenta and mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW  Mimosa was good. END
BEGIN NOW  Polenta was fine. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a cute place f'sho. END
BEGIN NOW The cute table gave my sweater dress a splinter. END
BEGIN NOW  Good thing it didn't puncture through my dress. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing else on the menu stood out to me so I probably won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW It'a located in good ol' Jack London square. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice location good for dates. END
BEGIN NOW  Walk around and catch the farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW  Or catch whatever is going on at Jack London square! They have Jack of all trades. END
BEGIN NOW  Movies in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW  The list goes on. END
BEGIN NOW Great food at reasonable prices. END
BEGIN NOW  Taken out of town guests here twice and everyone has commented on the excellent quality of the food. END
BEGIN NOW Food - fantastic! I've tried or sampled: pork banh mi, mussels, chicken torta, the chop burger, Ruben, and fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW  All were flawless and would order each item again. END
BEGIN NOW  I would give special attention to the broth with the mussels and ask for extra bread; you don't want to let that broth go to waste. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks- again fantastic! I've tried the Bloody Mary with and without Bacon - highly recommend either as they tickle all different flavor areas on your tongue. END
BEGIN NOW   Also had a Spicy Q, drink with rum and jalapeño, would order on the rocks next time but delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Service - first visit was absolutely amazing - server was a mind reader - on it for drink orders and brought extra bread for the mussels without us even asking. END
BEGIN NOW   I tipped 30% in appreciation. END
BEGIN NOW Second visit was sub-par. END
BEGIN NOW  I just felt like the server didn't want to be there and didn't ask if we wanted a second round of drinks when we were low. END
BEGIN NOW  Ended up not ordering more drinks because we finished our food. END
BEGIN NOW  Also asked how was the food while facing another table and not making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW  Head wasn't in the game. END
BEGIN NOW  Essentially barely checking on us after the food came out. END
BEGIN NOW  I was server for 4 years, we all have those off days (or hangovers), I get it. END
BEGIN NOW Atmosphere - really love the bar and wood elements inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Pig pictures on the walls and pig toilet paper holder in bathroom is a funny touch. END
BEGIN NOW  Saw a TV but it was not on during lunch hours for either visit. END
BEGIN NOW not sure if that was intentional or not but it created more of a conversational experience at my table with dudes who would have normally zoned out to sportscenter. END
BEGIN NOW  Didn't bother me either way, just felt it should be noted. END
BEGIN NOW Overall - 4 Stars - would give them a 5 except for service on second visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect ratings are reserved for perfect restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW Pastrami Potato Hash was well seasoned, poached eggs were done perfectly and the potatoes were solid. END
BEGIN NOW The frittata was a unique twist on the classic. END
BEGIN NOW  There's was thinner with a crispy bottom vs traditional ones that is thicker and more reminiscent of a pie. END
BEGIN NOW The variety is good but not the best for vegetarians especially during brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Expect to wait especially during peak times. END
BEGIN NOW Overall Thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad I got a chance to try Chop Bar and more grateful that I didn't leave disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW Not going to lie, one of the best parts of Chop Bar is that you can call 30 min in advance and put your name down for a table. END
BEGIN NOW  I was on Bart when I called and upon arrival a table was waiting for us! A few other groups were waiting outside for brunch but we just sat right down. END
BEGIN NOW  (if only SF places were like this. END
BEGIN NOW ). END
BEGIN NOW Walking up, we saw some people with the bloody marys and they looked incredible! I personally don't like bloody marys but my friend said it wasn't quite as spicy as she would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW  The pickled veggies and the bacon that come with it were delicious though!. END
BEGIN NOW I got the french toast with apples and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW  The toast was pretty fluffy and thoroughly soaked in syrup. END
BEGIN NOW  In fact, the toast was in a pool of syrup so the last few bites were a bit too soggy. END
BEGIN NOW  I also wished there had been more apples and walnuts because that would have added more texture to the dish. END
BEGIN NOW Chop Bar is a great spot for brunch and lunch. END
BEGIN NOW Brunch: 4 stars, Lunch: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  Dinner: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW Although the brunch menu may look like your typical brunch, they really do a great job. END
BEGIN NOW  The quality of ingredients and the flavors are on point. END
BEGIN NOW  The chilaquiles and french toast are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Lunch is also good too but the few times I've been I wasn't too impressed with their menu. END
BEGIN NOW  One item I really enjoyed was their clams. END
BEGIN NOW  My mom had the pork banh-mi and I wasn't too impressed when I tried it. END
BEGIN NOW  It was expensive and made with great quality ingredients I'm sure, but it didn't beat a $4 banh mi I could get in chinatown. END
BEGIN NOW  I also tried the oxtail poutine which was a little too saucy and it needed either more fries or bread on the side to dip into it. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious but I couldn't just slurp the gravy on its own. END
BEGIN NOW All in all, the service is great and there is a great amount of parking near by. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is nice with indoor and outdoor seating. END
BEGIN NOW  The last time I went Festus Ezeli from the warriors was sitting near me. END
BEGIN NOW  I was pretty star struck and decided not to disturb him, but that was a cool memory of this place! (:. END
BEGIN NOW Wanted to try the Bloody Mary ($8) at this place since I heard it was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I had never had one before, so I figured I might as well start with a good one. END
BEGIN NOW  Needless to say, I don't think I'm the Bloody Mary type. END
BEGIN NOW  It had a nice flavor, but it's too spicy and more like a meal in a glass (I'm also not a fan of milkshakes with my food). END
BEGIN NOW  I do recommend getting it with bacon ($2 extra), as it's some of the best I've had. END
BEGIN NOW The food came to us oddly quick. END
BEGIN NOW  Within minutes. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the asparagus appetizer ($11). END
BEGIN NOW  It came with a poached egg and some sort of green sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Flavor was nice, but it was a little salty. END
BEGIN NOW  Not too salty, just a little. END
BEGIN NOW I got the Chop Bar Burger for my meal ($14) with Swiss cheese ($1 extra, but some add-ons were $2 extra). END
BEGIN NOW  Meat-wise, the burger was top notch. END
BEGIN NOW  And I liked the bun, too. END
BEGIN NOW  Other than that, there weren't a whole lot of other flavors going on. END
BEGIN NOW  Just the bacon, which merely added to the saltiness of the patty. END
BEGIN NOW  The Swiss cheese and the aioli were non-existent. END
BEGIN NOW  I even asked for more aioli for extra taste. END
BEGIN NOW  It only barely helped. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't a bad burger by any means. END
BEGIN NOW  It was just too reliant on the bold meat flavor and needed a little more craft. END
BEGIN NOW My dad got the pork confit ($20) with a side of Jo-Jos ($6), which are basically potato wedges. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork was very flavorful, and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW They specialize in meat, and they passed with flying colors in that department. END
BEGIN NOW  It's just that they tend to add a lot of ingredients that merely sound good on paper without truly complimenting each other. END
BEGIN NOW Also, this place is a tad bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW  $8 for the Bloody Mary isn't bad, but the food is just too expensive for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had better for less. END
BEGIN NOW But most importantly, this place was good enough to make me want to come back to try their other menu items. END
BEGIN NOW We heard the meatloaf was good, but I guess we'll save that for next time. END
BEGIN NOW Try ordering ANYTHING off the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  These guys have ZERO interest in giving a customer a satisfying experience. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel bad because the chefs are working hard trying to make amazing food and it's being served by these indifferent "hipster barrista" types. END
BEGIN NOW Damn disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW Sunday brunch was most excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated fairly quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  The staff was incredibly attentive and nice. END
BEGIN NOW  All smiles!. END
BEGIN NOW The French toast is a big win. END
BEGIN NOW  Custard-dipped brioche with candied walnuts, apples and whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW  It was to die for. END
BEGIN NOW Other big wins was the chiliquiles with chorizo and salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW  A really big portion. END
BEGIN NOW The side of bacon was meh. END
BEGIN NOW  It was actually one slice of bacon cut in three chunks. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't particularly tasty and $5 which was a bit of a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee was most excellent and local. END
BEGIN NOW Will definitely visit this place again. END
BEGIN NOW I love that this place lets you call ahead for brunch to put your name down on the list. END
BEGIN NOW  I cannot appreciate that enough. END
BEGIN NOW  I oftentimes will avoid brunch in SF because I don't want to wait over an hour after I get there just to get seated. END
BEGIN NOW I tried the bloody mary "baconized". END
BEGIN NOW  I saw other people with the bloody mary as we walked in and decided right then that I had to get it. END
BEGIN NOW  It looked like a pretty standard bloody mary, but with bacon on top (I know, right?!)!! Not sure how much I actually liked the bacon in it, but it was definitely an interesting twist. END
BEGIN NOW  The bloody mary itself was decent, a little on the tomato-y side, not super spicy. END
BEGIN NOW The menu is not super extensive, but has your standard brunch options. END
BEGIN NOW  Between me and my friends, we ordered a few different things. END
BEGIN NOW 1) Pastrami hash (with poached eggs) - I had this, it was pretty tasty, nothing particularly special about it, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I enjoyed it, though it was more like chunks of pastrami and potato, rather than a hash really. END
BEGIN NOW 2) Pork belly frittata - The pork belly in the frittata looked like it had a good fat to lean ratio (which is important!) but wasn't seasoned quite enough. END
BEGIN NOW 3) Eggs cazuela. END
BEGIN NOW 4) French toast. END
BEGIN NOW Chop Bar is the good Oakland, the kind you want to show off to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW It's located in a cool loft space in Jack London, within walking distance from the Blue Bottle flagship location. END
BEGIN NOW  The wait on a Sunday afternoon teeters around 20 mins, which isn't all that bad in comparison to some spots in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW The menu features all kinds of new American and California inspired plates. END
BEGIN NOW  Their burger is a serious force to be reckoned with. END
BEGIN NOW  This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  Let me lay this out for you. END
BEGIN NOW  the bun is somewhere between sourdough and a pastry. END
BEGIN NOW  It is remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW  The hamburger patty is so thick and so juicy and as you eat this thing, the juices dribble out and the soft part of the bun soaks it up. END
BEGIN NOW  Thick, hickory smoked slices of bacon and avocado adorn this creation. END
BEGIN NOW  Make sure to add cheese too because, holy crap, the melted swiss cheese on this thing was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  I asked for medium rare and received a very well done patty, but I was too hungry to do anything about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Kind of a bummer, so make sure your waiter knows you're not playing around. END
BEGIN NOW They only have 4 beers on tap, none of which is a pilsner, and all their taps were broken when I went. END
BEGIN NOW  Basically their only downfall is being a beer buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW I feel like Chop Bar can do no wrong. END
BEGIN NOW I've had dinner here twice, and stopped in one time for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW   While it can get kind of loud in this small, intimate space, you'll probably be too busy savoring the amazing food to want to talk to whoever else you're with. END
BEGIN NOW   Just keeping it 100. END
BEGIN NOW Their agua frescas ($3) are, well, refreshing. END
BEGIN NOW   If you want something other than water, but that won't drive your BAC up, this is a great choice. END
BEGIN NOW   I had a watermelon one for dinner and it had the faintest hint of lime in it, too. END
BEGIN NOW   Even with the striking blend of flavors, I think it blended pretty well with the pork chop I ordered that evening. END
BEGIN NOW For lunch, I opted for their pork Bolognese with pac mac noodles by Baia Pasta (shop. END
BEGIN NOW baiapasta. END
BEGIN NOW com/produ…) - $18. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're not in the mood for meat, there's also a seasonal vegetable option, too. END
BEGIN NOW   With a generous portion of shaved parmesan on top, this dish really hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Just the right ratio of noodles to sauce, with plenty of chunks of savory ground pork. END
BEGIN NOW The first time I had dinner here, I went for the oxtail poutine - $20 (french fries, oxtail gravy, Fiscalini cheddar). END
BEGIN NOW   I might or might not have licked the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW The second time I went for dinner, I ordered the pork chop and chose kale and mashed potatoes as my side dishes (you also have the option of going with their mac and cheese) - $24. END
BEGIN NOW   Their mashed potatoes were just too good. END
BEGIN NOW   I honestly want to ask them to double up on the mashed potatoes next time. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe i'll just beg for a bowl as my entree. END
BEGIN NOW   The kale was cooked perfectly with onions and garlic, too, and I definitely felt less guilty eating them. END
BEGIN NOW  but the mashed potatoes!!!  As for the pork chop, goodness. END
BEGIN NOW   There was a slight crust that formed all around while the interior remained tender and moist. END
BEGIN NOW   It came in a pool of gravy that complimented it nicely, too, not salty or gelatinous as some gravies can be. END
BEGIN NOW I would definitely be proud to show this gem of a gastropub to friends and family. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe next time I'll try some appetizers and desserts, too. END
BEGIN NOW We came here for brunch on Mother's Day , we called about 30 mins ahead and was seated almost right away. END
BEGIN NOW  The food arrived quickly and the server was great. END
BEGIN NOW  We got the pork hash , the eggs Benedict and eggs Benedict with crab and the torta. END
BEGIN NOW  All the food was perfect and cooked wonderfully. END
BEGIN NOW  The torta was almost like a banh mi fusion but I'm not complaining , I probably wouldn't call it a torta but it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The crab eggs Benedict tasted amazing , they were really generous with the crab and came with a generous side of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  Of course I can't forget about the hot sauce , they had cholula and a house made sauce that was really smokey and delicious but pretty spicy. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't wait to come back again. END
BEGIN NOW This place is eehhhh. END
BEGIN NOW  The price we paid was definitely not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW  2 entrees and a coffee and orange juice cost us about $40! The French toast was so soggy. END
BEGIN NOW  My husband ordered the pork belly hash. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't even pork belly more like small tiny pieces of bacon and there's no hash! It was just home style potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  Not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW  Go over by lake Merritt for way better brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW come to Portal's Queer Beer Wednesday every week! The sliders on the happy hour menu are my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW UPDATE: I have been coming to every QBW for over a year! The fried chicken sliders are a welcome addition to the before 5:00 "happy (hour) meal" menu, and I'm not sorry to see the cheese sauce go from the fries either. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal's rotating menu of craft beers has taught me a lot about beer and about my taste too. END
BEGIN NOW  Ask for Melvin. END
BEGIN NOW  He's the best!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is pretty neat. END
BEGIN NOW  I came in for lunch on a beautiful afternoon and sat on the outdoor patio overlooking the lake. END
BEGIN NOW There was a large party of 12 requiring the attn of most of the wait staff (3 servers). END
BEGIN NOW  Service was very slow from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW  Not a place for a quick bite or lunch if you're on the clock. END
BEGIN NOW The food was very good. END
BEGIN NOW  Quality ingredients and large portions. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the Garlic bread meatball sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW  The mini burgers and chilaquiles looked good and I hope to come back for those. END
BEGIN NOW Overall a good spot, but service was shoddy -- no refills or checkups. END
BEGIN NOW Came here for dinner with a few friends. END
BEGIN NOW   We shared the vegetarian garbage bread, which was quite delish. END
BEGIN NOW   The garbage bread was very hearty, and it definitely did not need meat. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW   For myself, I ordered 2 mini burgers in fried chicken and turkey, both were quite filling and tasty, though not as exciting as our garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW Overall the atmosphere was a nice small pub, great for a couple of friends. END
BEGIN NOW   The outside area is also very cute, definitely want to return for brunch with mimosas!  Will update my review upon return!. END
BEGIN NOW I'm completely in love with this place. END
BEGIN NOW  The food, the people, the beer, and seating!! Very close to the lake with outdoor seating (there's indoor seating as well). END
BEGIN NOW  They have 3 tvs inside, and one shared bathroom (the only drawback). END
BEGIN NOW I love the beer selection here, only problem I have is that there's a high turn over of the beer. END
BEGIN NOW  As soon as you fall in love with one there's one to replace it. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is great, try the cheese knots. END
BEGIN NOW  They're basically like homemade mozzarella sticks and they will change your life on how you see mozzarella sticks. END
BEGIN NOW  The wings are great as well. END
BEGIN NOW  Not bad prices. END
BEGIN NOW There's parking all around. END
BEGIN NOW  When you sit outside you have views of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Very nice decor both indoor and outdoor. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW  They do have vegan and veg options!. END
BEGIN NOW It is definitely worth the (honestly not bad) wait for a table on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW  I was so relaxed with a beer and good food, staring out at the breezy lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Thank God out of their decently-sized list of beers on tap, there was at least one sour. END
BEGIN NOW  We just barely missed bottomless mimosas (I believe they're done at 1 pm?), damn. END
BEGIN NOW We shared the pork belly salad and garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  If it sounds like we were eating light, we absolutely were not. END
BEGIN NOW  The garbage bread sneaks up on you, and all the fixings inside are going to make you groan after it settles in twenty or so minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious in the moment, though. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork belly salad was average, and a bit overdressed/salty. END
BEGIN NOW Parking was fortunately easy to find all around, and seriously, thank God for the location. END
BEGIN NOW  We had to walk it off for an hour around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW Portal is like. END
BEGIN NOW one of those places where you stumble across on accident. END
BEGIN NOW  But at the end of the day you realize the encounter was supposed to happen. END
BEGIN NOW  Some may even say "divine intervention" well at least for those into bar food with a light sophisticated twist. END
BEGIN NOW  And those that like local beers, hoppy ales, and micro brews. END
BEGIN NOW  And a nice view of Lake Merrit from the patio. END
BEGIN NOW  So far Portal has a few things right. END
BEGIN NOW  Allow me to tell you a little more. END
BEGIN NOW  Here is my review of Portal. END
BEGIN NOW 4/21/16. END
BEGIN NOW My constant Yelping seems to have rubbed on aome of my friends! I decided to stay and take in Oakland after going to my guard card class earlier on in the day. END
BEGIN NOW  I had booked marked so many places in Oakland and didn't think I was going to get to visit any of them until my buddy contacted me after seeing me check in on "Facebook" in the "City of Oakland" he was like "Yo dude you in my hood, I been checking out some cool gastropubs on Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  Let's check out this place called Portal!" I was stoked because I one didn't know my homie "Yelped" and two because I didn't realize I had bookedmarked it already. END
BEGIN NOW  So I was totally down. END
BEGIN NOW  He swooped me up and we set off. END
BEGIN NOW It was nice to see a few places I've bookedmarked in Oakland as we drove throughout downtown and the Lake Merrit area. END
BEGIN NOW  But our minds were set, we wanted to step this "Portal" and have some good beer and bar fair. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice to see Lake Merrit as kinda the. END
BEGIN NOW "Landmark" if you were trying to find this place and another east bay restarunt that's creating a buzz (rockin crawfish oakland) which is like. END
BEGIN NOW across the street. END
BEGIN NOW  But back to the reason for this review. END
BEGIN NOW Portal!. END
BEGIN NOW Service - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW Food - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW Beer 100/5 :D. END
BEGIN NOW The Warriors played this day so this place went from like empty to packed house in like a 10 min span. END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention my NY Yankees were playing as well so. END
BEGIN NOW I was indeed having a great day. END
BEGIN NOW  My homie and I started with some 805's (beer) with bbq and hot wings for starters. END
BEGIN NOW  Of you've had 805 before, its a pretty good light beer made here in cali, it really compliments light foods in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW  The wings were prefect! Fried just right, the sauces were just enough and not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW  Plus the prices were pretty good on the food and beer here as well (see my my pics for prices and menu shots!) oh. END
BEGIN NOW and if you get a pitcher of the "Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme 11% abv" be prepared to take a "Uber or Lyft" home :D. END
BEGIN NOW Will I go back?. END
BEGIN NOW In a heartbeat!. END
BEGIN NOW In conclusion, this place is perfect for hanging out, happy hour, dates, shenanigans and just chillaxing. END
BEGIN NOW  And with the Patio, I'm sure the ambiance at night is just pretty ill with Lake Merrit as the backdrop. END
BEGIN NOW  I say if you've bookedmarked this place before, I would say give it a go! You will like it here! Of not. END
BEGIN NOW you just hard to please! :D As always yelp your own experience. END
BEGIN NOW Oakland you have a winner! My first time at this place & I loved everything about this hipster spot. END
BEGIN NOW We got there right at 10am when they opened. END
BEGIN NOW  I can see where the wait can be a little long especially if you want to sit on the patio (which has a gorgeous view of Lake Merit). END
BEGIN NOW Everyone at the table had a little bit of everything. END
BEGIN NOW  The Migas, The Drunk Bread, Guacamole, French Toast. END
BEGIN NOW  We loved all the food. END
BEGIN NOW  I will definitely be back next time I am in town. END
BEGIN NOW Oh yeah. END
BEGIN NOW cannot forget the bottomless Mimosas!. END
BEGIN NOW On the outskirts of Lake Merrit, you will find that this little pub/beer garden pleasantly awaits you. END
BEGIN NOW  You really can't beat Portal's back patio. END
BEGIN NOW  Especially because, the inside of Portal isn't huge - think a few tables and a bar. END
BEGIN NOW  That back patio, tho. END
BEGIN NOW  Communal seating - so, think beer garden steez. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been a few times at wonky hours, think 3:30 looking for brunch and sadly, they stick to dining hours for food, although you can always order drinks and items like fries and such. END
BEGIN NOW  Another huge pro about Portal is their beer list. END
BEGIN NOW  Craft beer aficionnados, you will not be disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW I've had their bloody mary and it's good, not the best, but real solid. END
BEGIN NOW  As always, more accoutrements, please. END
BEGIN NOW  And to my surprise, no vodka in this bad boy, soju only. END
BEGIN NOW  Just an fyi if you happen to be a BM purist. END
BEGIN NOW  They do offer some bottomless mimosa deals during weekend brunch hours, but you'll have to go inquire about prices. END
BEGIN NOW Most recently for lunch, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my cobb salad and the surprise happy ending. END
BEGIN NOW  No, not that one, ya scumbags. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a delicious, almost pizza like dough that serves as the bottom layer of the salad. END
BEGIN NOW  Score. END
BEGIN NOW  A pretty hefty salad that isn't cheap at $14, but quite filling and freshly filled with juicy chicken, crisp bacon, eggs and so on; pretty much the most unhealthy salad on earth. END
BEGIN NOW  Yep, that's me. END
BEGIN NOW  Other items that piqued my fancy: the burger, the garbage bread, the meatball sub and those fries looked mighty fine. END
BEGIN NOW Go. END
BEGIN NOW  Drink beer. END
BEGIN NOW  Enjoy that Oakland sunshine and eat!. END
BEGIN NOW I've  not been in awhile they've been pretty busy which is awesome for them, so I went in today and it's just gotten soo casual in service to a point of rude. END
BEGIN NOW The glass was dirty and the server was poignantly rude by rolling he's eyes slightly when asked for a new one ya know what, I left,I've had enough of Portals slight distain. END
BEGIN NOW  I adored portal when they first set foot in the space wasabi once was but now sits a pissy example of they're former selves,polite cool,easy,clean selves. END
BEGIN NOW Now it seems like any other place overblown semi ok food staff who seems put out by the customers of which I should add wasn't at capacity so I was surprised at the very lack of any service. END
BEGIN NOW  I've actually wanted to say this last bit for a while about the food the last few times we'd gone in it just seemed lacking undercooked food mostly. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm bummed I really did like this place. END
BEGIN NOW We got to the restaurant 20 minutes before it opened for saturday brunch and there was already a huge line. END
BEGIN NOW  I think a lot of the line is for those who want to sit outside on a beautiful sunny Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW  And even with the line, they'll offer to get your brunch drink started. END
BEGIN NOW Service was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I remembered the name of the fella that served us but he was incredibly helpful, patient and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  Portions are HUGE so order accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW We go the bottomless mimosa and their pours are SERIOUS. END
BEGIN NOW  it's pretty much champagne with a tiny splash of OJ. END
BEGIN NOW  Seth Rogan looking bartender: you are on point. END
BEGIN NOW  My faves in terms of food:. END
BEGIN NOW Garbage Bread- it's a pizza burito. END
BEGIN NOW  get the meat one. END
BEGIN NOW  get it. END
BEGIN NOW  eat it. END
BEGIN NOW  you're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffed Challah French Toast- I thought i was done eating but my arm was still shoveling it in my face. END
BEGIN NOW Tempeh Hash- we got it with poached eggs and goat cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  perfect recommendation. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely will be coming back to enjoy the rest of the menu and the ambience outside!. END
BEGIN NOW The door is an actual porthole. END
BEGIN NOW  Talk about puns!!. END
BEGIN NOW I actually had a difficult time opening the door because it was so heavy lol and then I started questioning if that was even was the door in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW  To my embarrassment, it was! You just need to pull a little harder then normal. END
BEGIN NOW  I was visiting a friend and local native at Portal for a quick beer and a much needed catch up. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated right away and the place had a lot of character! They have a wide selection of beer and wine and a phenomenal happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW The server was cheery and helpful--he recommended the steak which was cooked to perfection! It was so tender and the seasoning was nothing like I've ever had before. END
BEGIN NOW  My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It's definitely a steak I will never forget. END
BEGIN NOW  We had some veggies on the side which were asparagus and several different types of squash that were in season--a perfect pairing with the steak. END
BEGIN NOW  The meal was very filling and we ended up sitting there talking for hours. END
BEGIN NOW It started getting busy around 8pm and people were rolling in for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a fantastic place if you live nearby and want to grab drinks after work. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm so jealous that there isn't one near me in Sacramento! Their employees are friendly and made spot-on recommendations about the food and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Alright Portal, you surprised me last night. END
BEGIN NOW  I've eaten there seeeeeeveral times and was meh about the food. END
BEGIN NOW  But last night, my ravioli was #onpoint though. END
BEGIN NOW  Dude ate the meatball sammy which came with a heaaaaalthy portion of greens. END
BEGIN NOW  Thanks for keeping it healthy. END
BEGIN NOW  You always have an excellent selection of beers. END
BEGIN NOW  While neither of us had any of the Brewery doing the tap takeover, I love that you were a supporter of beer week. END
BEGIN NOW The three stars because in all of my other experiences there, the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW  So perhaps the dinner entrees are just better than the brunch? I'll have to go again before I can leave a higher rating for that. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, it closes at 11 and there's not a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I understand but hey. END
BEGIN NOW sometimes I just need a shot of vodka. END
BEGIN NOW  ;). END
BEGIN NOW But it's a cute spot to go and have a few brews with the homies yo. END
BEGIN NOW  With a large patio and hopefully running heat lamps on cold days, it's a nice spot to go near the lake or after Rockin Crawfish. END
BEGIN NOW I learned a very important lesson during my visit to Portal Restaurant: never visit an establishment that has multiple signs posted on the front of the building advertising the need and higher for chefs. END
BEGIN NOW  After a twenty minute wait to be seated on an early Saturday night, we were guided to four seats at a community table. END
BEGIN NOW  I think the draw of Portal or many is the large outdoor patio with views of Lake Merritt, is truly is picturesque. END
BEGIN NOW  The adult beverage list is fairly average for the area (although they claim to be a "beer garden" their selection and simply lack of beer menus makes me question this claim), their dinner menu is set with several appetizer and entree items but is not extensive. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered sharing plates for four people which included:. END
BEGIN NOW *ricotta bites: as delicious as they sound, fried on the outside, cheesy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Portion came with four bites and a marinara sauce (sauce to bites ratio was off, request more sauce if you ever see your waitress!). END
BEGIN NOW *cesar salad: OK, covered with parmesan cheese and house-made croutons, large portion but lacked flavor and dressing to lettuce ratio was off. END
BEGIN NOW *brussels sprouts: Good, but damn, I feel like a good home-chef should be able to whip up some taste brussels, and these aren't any better than what I can make a home. END
BEGIN NOW *garbage bread: Best part of the meal, hands down! Tasty, flavorful, crispy and chewy: this is their signature dish. END
BEGIN NOW  It's served with a the same marinara sauce sauce as the ricotta bites and a overly powerful pesto sauce that I'd recommend skipping. END
BEGIN NOW  Try to get extra marinara sauce when the food is dropped off. END
BEGIN NOW *chicken wings: This was the most disappointing part of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW  We received our chicken wings (granted, our dishes were coming out in stages, so they weren't rushing to prepare everything at the same time) and the chicken was RAW. END
BEGIN NOW  We pointed it out to our waitress, she said "yes, that's raw!" and returned it to the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  Not acknowledgment more from her, no visit from the chef or manager, simply embarrassing and a terrible way to conduct business. END
BEGIN NOW  The only acknowledgement from our waitress (who practically abandoned our table!) was if we'd like to order something else instead. END
BEGIN NOW  The chicken wings weren't included on the check but our replacement item was. END
BEGIN NOW *garlic fries: (replacement for chicken) very lackluster, they're the a-typical garlic fry of every restaurant out there. END
BEGIN NOW I believe that Portal has been nights, but I'd stay far away until they have consistency in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  If you see that they're hiring chefs, RUN!. END
BEGIN NOW Coming for a weekend brunch? Expect a wait - everyone wants to eat here! We came here on a rainy day and even then, there was a long line of people waiting for some brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW PARKING: Street parking - plenty! We were able to find street parking no problem. END
BEGIN NOW SEATING: Indoor & outdoor seating available (but when it's raining, only indoor seating available). END
BEGIN NOW  Not very many tables inside which is probably why there's a long line. END
BEGIN NOW BAR: There's a bar also! You can grab a drink while you're waiting for your table. END
BEGIN NOW  Weekend brunch calls for AYCD mimosas from opening til 1pm!. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD: Soooo many great options! I had the Portal Benedict (you can add ham, bacon, or avocado for an extra $3). END
BEGIN NOW  You won't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu! Other highlights are the Corned Beef Hash. END
BEGIN NOW  We're in to try the Garbage Bread next time - we didn't want any leftovers this time. END
BEGIN NOW A-okay Portal! We'll be back :) Maybe on a sunny day so we can enjoy some brunch and a stroll around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW Portal is a gem in Oakland! It's located right next to Lake Merritt and from the outside seating, you can get a pretty nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here during an off hour between lunch and dinner! The waiter was super nice and accommodating, letting us pick wherever we wanted to sit outside. END
BEGIN NOW We started off by ordering two beers. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a pretty good variety of standard mixes and other interesting flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  The waiter helped make recommendations depending on our tastes of dark, light, and so on. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the meat garbage bread (Yelp told me to, so I had to!!) and the garlic bread meatball sub. END
BEGIN NOW  The meatballs were recommended but I love garlic bread so I figured why not mix the two of those together! The garlic bread meatball sub also came with a side salad. END
BEGIN NOW  Those two orders were more than enough for the two of us and we actually had some leftover. END
BEGIN NOW I definitely recommend the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't let the name fool you. END
BEGIN NOW it's definitely not garbage! The garbage bread was a treasure. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the cheese melted on top and the inside was stuffed with delicious goodies. END
BEGIN NOW  The meatball garlic sub was good but not incredibly impressive. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe it's because I'm not too big of a fan of meatballs to begin with. END
BEGIN NOW  It was definitely good but just wasn't as mind blowing as the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW I plan on coming back to Portal for brunch sometime so I heard there's a great unlimited mimosa option and they have an amazing menu for breakfast! This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat before a baseball game (which we did)!. END
BEGIN NOW I can't think of one bad time here at Portal. END
BEGIN NOW  It's always a good time! From brunch to dinner, all times of the day are great at this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Love brunch on the patio because of all the natural sunlight that fills the backyard and love dinner on the patio too because they crank up the jams and it's beautifully lit with string lights to set the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW Recs: Lunch- herbed garlic fries are incredible (what's in that frying oil?!), Turkey Mini Burger is my fave out all their sliders. END
BEGIN NOW Brunch- must try their polenta!. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner- Turkey Meatballs, no need to add pasta if you're looking for a carb-less entree, so hearty and deliciously tender. END
BEGIN NOW  Fried Brussel Sprouts, the smell is intoxicating. END
BEGIN NOW I missed out on the bottomless mimosa but glad I ordered Mr. END
BEGIN NOW  Pickles! Portal pickle their own garnishes and boy did they all go well with the spicy drink!. END
BEGIN NOW We came around 11 on a Saturday and wait was about 20 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  This was right before the brunch rush and one of the Warriors playoffs! Would have love to enjoy their outside patio which was spacious but pretty exposed to the sun. END
BEGIN NOW  So we sat at the bar with our awesome female bartender/server, enjoyed our food and watched the Warriors kicked the Rockets booties till they were red!. END
BEGIN NOW Ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW 1. END
BEGIN NOW  House coffee - strong and good. END
BEGIN NOW 2. END
BEGIN NOW  Mr. END
BEGIN NOW  Pickles - obsessed with it. END
BEGIN NOW 3. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal Benedict - never had it on grilled polenta before so it was a unique taste. END
BEGIN NOW  Good but very filling. END
BEGIN NOW 4. END
BEGIN NOW  BF and I were so full but decided to be pigs and stuffed ourselves more with the Stuffed Challah French toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Also good but there was something else other then the ricotta filling in between those bread. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure if it was banana or plantain. END
BEGIN NOW which I'm not a big fan of. END
BEGIN NOW Other then that, for a bar that serves food. END
BEGIN NOW Portal got my vote as a go-to spot for brunch or just a drink on their patio!. END
BEGIN NOW Everything about this place is Meh. END
BEGIN NOW The food, service, ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW  It's all meh. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sure hipsters love this place. END
BEGIN NOW Had my birthday dinner here on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW  We were greeted and sat quickly. END
BEGIN NOW We tried the Sonoma bourbon cider ($6) prairie bomb beer ($12) for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The cider came in a bottle along with a glass. END
BEGIN NOW  It was okay, not as good as I had hopped. END
BEGIN NOW  The prairie bomb was a dark beer. END
BEGIN NOW  I normally hate dark beer due to the bitterness. END
BEGIN NOW  This one was great. END
BEGIN NOW  We took down the name so we can find it later. END
BEGIN NOW For dinner we ordered the meat garbage bread ($15) 2- sliders ($13) and BBQ frites ($8) When the food came I noticed the sliders weren't the ones we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server didn't come by for some time so we ate the garbage bread which was fabulous and the fries were great with the dipping sauces. END
BEGIN NOW  When I told our server about the slider error I asked to just have it removed from the bill since we were too stuffed to eat anymore. END
BEGIN NOW The server came back with our bill and said the manager gave a little discount ($3. END
BEGIN NOW 90) due to the mix up. END
BEGIN NOW  That was a nice gesture. END
BEGIN NOW The atmosphere has dim lighting, nice outdoor area and bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Hipster kind of place,. END
BEGIN NOW No hard alcohol available. END
BEGIN NOW  Cocktails are made with suju. END
BEGIN NOW  Beer and wine available. END
BEGIN NOW Here's the deal: I hate waiting in long lines. END
BEGIN NOW  In my experience, to avoid that and still eat breakfast here, you basically have to get here and wait for them to open. END
BEGIN NOW  For me, that means getting my butt out of bed and being outside before 8am on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW BUT, here is what I will say. END
BEGIN NOW  they're great). END
BEGIN NOW 4 stars instead of 5 because I've had a couple misses here. END
BEGIN NOW  I think it was when they had first opened up. END
BEGIN NOW  In any case, I think most folks will find something they'll like on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW 've had pretty much everything on their menu, and every item is so great and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Um, delicious coffee (Highwire), delish micheladas, delish food and pastries. END
BEGIN NOW  Obviously it sucks to wait in line, but whatever- this is the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW  Get used to it. END
BEGIN NOW  I like to get there early and beat the later crowd. END
BEGIN NOW And please send whoever designed the space my way--beautiful!!!. END
BEGIN NOW Weekday late brunch: Nailed it. END
BEGIN NOW This spot is a total gem, nestled in the Laurel District serving up some really upscale, but down home eats. END
BEGIN NOW  Mostly breakfast, but don't fret, they do have some lunch options as well. END
BEGIN NOW  All their breads and pastries are made in house, they serve organic eggs and all meats are antibiotic and hormone free. END
BEGIN NOW  My health does matter, thank you very much!. END
BEGIN NOW My goat cheese omelet ($13) was what dreams are made of: a fluffy omelet oozing with goat cheese, snap peas, asparagus, garlic and spring onions. END
BEGIN NOW  I inhaled it. END
BEGIN NOW  In addition to this perfect egg dish, were some crispy potatoes, salad and perfectly toasted homemade bread with house made jam. END
BEGIN NOW  DAYUUUUMMMMM. END
BEGIN NOW  Writing this review is taking back to pure eating bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee was solid and prices are fair for portion sizes and service was lovely. END
BEGIN NOW  Granted, it wasn't busy at all, but this spot is a neighborhood joint and service is to match. END
BEGIN NOW  I can imagine some frustration during those weekend hours, but well worth the wait; I loved everything about Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW Items I will be returning for: strawberry cream cheese danish, the beef hash and that cubano sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW  Sign me up. END
BEGIN NOW A new and not-so-much longer hidden gem in Oakland's Laurel District that is the perfect place for a weekend brunch on one of those sunny days that Oakland is famous for! I am a real fan of this great neighborhood diner where everything is homemade from their pastries to their jams in addition to their classic dishes for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  And Sequoia Diner lives up the hype that's been expressed from so many reviews and images posted from my fellow Yelpers!. END
BEGIN NOW I actually found out about Sequoia Diner due to the fact it seemed like it was on Yelp's "New Businesses in East Bay" for an eternity! It actually opened about a year ago, replacing the long-standing Full House Cafe, by a local husband and wife duo who wanted to stay loyal to the neighborhood with their seasonal brunch classics served all morning until mid-afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW  There is so much buzz for Sequoia Diner that wait times can be quite long for brunch and parking on MacArthur Avenue and the surrounding area can be quite dicey. END
BEGIN NOW  So plan ahead it you don't mind waiting. END
BEGIN NOW  Luckily, I had friends who were eager enough to get there early and put our names down and patient enough for me to get there just a wee bit late. END
BEGIN NOW Once we were sat in their patent leather booths, we each knew what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW  (I had been doing enough research from my fellow Yelper's images and reviews to know what to order and what to pass up. END
BEGIN NOW ) We knew we all had to get the highly-recommended Pecan Sticky Buns and at $3. END
BEGIN NOW 75 each it's a good deal, so much so, the three of us ordered two buns to share. END
BEGIN NOW  I found them not too sweet or sticky with the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and topped with an abundance of chopped pecans. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a perfect accompaniment to your coffee. END
BEGIN NOW As for my main dish, I knew that some Sequoia Diner plates were heavier than others, but I also wanted to taste some of the best and unique dishes that they have to offer to get a read on how they prepare their meals here. END
BEGIN NOW  So I went with the Country Breakfast with its biscuit and gravy, collared greens, hash browns and two eggs made to order. END
BEGIN NOW  Although obviously heavy, my dish was solid, I especially loved the creamy gravy, warm biscuit, and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW  You could tell with the first bite how much homemade goodness was put into your meal. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite being constantly busy, the service for the most part was attentive and there was constant turnover of the tables and counter-tops, made the flow of service that much more pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Sequoia Diner is your classic mom-and-pop owned and operated American breakfast joint with modern day sustainable and locavore sensibilities. END
BEGIN NOW  Their eclectic menu makes me want to come back for more, everything sounds so familiar yet so unique that it seems like you can't go wrong. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't wait to return one day to see how Sequoia Diner continues to build upon their success in a loyal and foodie loving neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW I never loved brunch much, always made me feel comatose and heavy afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW   SD has the sweetspot between comfort and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW If you're ordering to-go, it's a good idea to call ahead, it took upwards of 30 minutes to get my order, there isn't much seating for those waiting, I ordered a coffee to hold me over while waiting, comes in super cute beige/brown cups, reminds me of the 70s and 80s. END
BEGIN NOW   Such a pleasant throwback to a simpler time. END
BEGIN NOW LOVED the Red Flannel Hash. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfectly poached eggs, kraut to cut the richness, cubes of al dente beets and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   They don't take substitutions. END
BEGIN NOW   I wanted to swap out one of the eggs for some chard, but had to order it separately. END
BEGIN NOW   Sour cream was mysteriously left off - perfect, I was going to omit it anyways. END
BEGIN NOW Homemade sourdough toast were a nice counterpart to the meal. END
BEGIN NOW   Comes pre-buttered. END
BEGIN NOW If you're there after 11AM, there are additional items you can order, got an asparagus, pea, arugula salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Sounds simple but the details were there: toasted almonds, slices of orange/blood orange, kumquats and pickled green beans. END
BEGIN NOW   Wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW Will be my mid-day treat going forward. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything seasoned well. END
BEGIN NOW   Carefully and expertly prepared. END
BEGIN NOW   So nice to have this quality of food available. END
BEGIN NOW   4 items: $35 including tax/tip. END
BEGIN NOW I love brunch but I don't always love brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW   So, it is no surprise that my hunt for the perfect local brunch spot has extended well into my second year in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm pleased to report the search is over. END
BEGIN NOW   Sequoia elevates humble breakfast staples -- not with a bunch of unnecessary frippery -- but by paying exquisite attention to the details. END
BEGIN NOW   Baked items are made in house including the incredible fresh biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW   The menu rotates with interesting seasonal specials. END
BEGIN NOW   On one visit, the loco moco had an incredibly rich shortrib gravy. END
BEGIN NOW   On the next, appetizers included chicken liver toasts with chicken cracklings and fig jam. END
BEGIN NOW   Good, simple food, presumably inspired by the personal tastes and whims of the chef (as well as the season) and made with heart and smarts. END
BEGIN NOW I don't understand the long wait for this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is good, but not especially amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd say it is pretty normal American food. END
BEGIN NOW  Perhaps my wife and I missed out by not getting any of their baked goods. END
BEGIN NOW When I saw Hazel's pictures from Sequoia Diner less than a month ago, I knew I needed to get myself over here soon. END
BEGIN NOW   Apparently I was not quick enough as word is out and an hour long wait seemed to be the constant on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW Upon arrival, since no one was up front, I grabbed a pen and was about to put my name down on the list but a few seconds later discovered that they have a hostess taking names and got my 1 hour wait estimate. END
BEGIN NOW   They do allow you to buy a coffee to enjoy outside while you wait so this non coffee drinker did the next best thing and ordered a sticky bun to go making the wait more bearable. END
BEGIN NOW   It was love at first bite as it was not overly sweet and enough pecans with each bite. END
BEGIN NOW We were seated within 45 minutes allowing me to digest that sticky bun freeing up stomach space to fully enjoy their breakfast plates. END
BEGIN NOW   I already had my eye on the beef hash with poached eggs which was just a plate of beautiful flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  Slight saltiness of the beef hash paired with the tartness from the pickled cabbage topped with the creaminess of the poached eggs and the final punch of the arugula will have you scraping up every morsel. END
BEGIN NOW   Since hubby didn't realize that the Red Flannel Hash did not already come with meat (bacon can be added for a charge), he did end up polishing off at least 1/3 of my beef hash and slice of my bread to be satisfied (good thing I was pre-fortified with that sticky bun). END
BEGIN NOW   I had a bite of his Red Flannel Hash which had great flavors as well for a vegetarian option but I do prefer the Beef Hash one. END
BEGIN NOW I thought the Coconut Thai Ice Tea was good and smooth with the coconut milk but like Hazel, felt like the tea flavor was way too light. END
BEGIN NOW   I rather use that $4 for another sticky bun!!. END
BEGIN NOW What a dream on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW  Their hours are limited (sad face!) but if you can make it out here for brunch, YOU MUST!!!! Yep, this place is multiple exclamation point good. END
BEGIN NOW  My second visit was this morning at 8 am on the dot (mind you, daylight savings time just happened so it's really like 7 am and it was raining) and there were a few hungry peeps waiting outside to come in. END
BEGIN NOW It is absolutely worth starting every meal here with a pecan sticky bun. END
BEGIN NOW  Warm and fluffy, and most importantly, totally shareable. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm telling you, you cannot be mad about anything in life after eating one of these. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like napping in a field with a hundred lambs. END
BEGIN NOW  And the coffee? Fill 'er up! They frequently make rounds to top you off of the dark, delicious brew. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't strayed from the Country Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  I just can't! Eggs any style, biscuit with gravy, hashbrowns, collard greens. END
BEGIN NOW  I could not design a better breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  I am a serious biscuit snob (they're so simple and yet people somehow ruin the simplicity of it) and I can say, Sequoia rocks the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like the Pat Benatar of biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW  Eventually I will try their huevos rancheros. END
BEGIN NOW The diner is bright, inviting, and has that Northern Oakland vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  They were smart about the design of the tables, where you can easily transition seating from 2 to larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW  However, this place is definitely not huge, so I have no idea how long it would take to accommodate a larger party during prime time. END
BEGIN NOW  Meanwhile, it's a perfect location for my 1:1 time with my besties. END
BEGIN NOW Skip Montclair's subpar spots, and give Sequoia Diner a shot. END
BEGIN NOW I'd had this bookmarked for a while, but ventured into the Laurel District in East Oakland for the first time this morning. END
BEGIN NOW  I was surprised to see that none of my trusted East Bay Yelpers had reviewed this place but was excited to give it a whirl. END
BEGIN NOW We arrived around 8:30 and found the place mostly full, but were able to grab the last available booth with no wait. END
BEGIN NOW  It has that diner charm, with a long bar counter and several booths along the wall. END
BEGIN NOW  This isn't the place to bring a large group, but it is perfectly cozy for 2 or 4. END
BEGIN NOW  There are several adorable waitresses that were super friendly, greeting you on the way in and out, and keeping the coffee coming. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the positive vibe. END
BEGIN NOW I like that they keep the menu relatively simple, with several classics, and a few twists. END
BEGIN NOW  No kids menu here, per se, but my boys were happy with their pastries. END
BEGIN NOW a pecan roll and the strawberry cream cheese danish. END
BEGIN NOW  They stood on their own as a small breakfast, but would be equally nice as a shared starter while you wait on the main event. END
BEGIN NOW I was thrilled with the mushroom and spinach scramble which, like their other egg dishes, come with some perfectly cooked and seasoned potatoes, some excellent sourdough toast, and a small rocket salad. END
BEGIN NOW  Seemingly simple, but it leaves you wondering why you can't do 'em that perfect at home. END
BEGIN NOW The Highwire brewed coffee wasn't my favorite, but it did the trick and my cup was never empty or cold. END
BEGIN NOW All in all, a real winner that will get added to the Sunday rotation!. END
BEGIN NOW I was sold when I saw that they have Pecan Sticky Buns!  I love sticky buns and for some reason, it's really hard to find it in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW   I used to get them at Berkeley Bowl, but they don't have it anymore. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm also very particular about my sticky buns. END
BEGIN NOW   Often the dough is not soft enough, it is too sweet or there is too much cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW   Sequoia Diner's Pecan Sticky Bun is perfect in all respects and the price is right too. END
BEGIN NOW   $3. END
BEGIN NOW 75 for one is quite reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a nice size, so two people can easily share one. END
BEGIN NOW  We ended up ordering one with our breakfast, and I took their last one to go. END
BEGIN NOW   It'll go great with my coffee tomorrow morning!. END
BEGIN NOW We did have other breakfast items as well. END
BEGIN NOW   My husband ordered the Beef Hash dish which came with a couple of perfectly poached eggs, pickled beets, arugula salad and carrots. END
BEGIN NOW   His plate was very colorful, and most importantly, the beef hash was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   He loved it and he was nice enough to let me taste it. END
BEGIN NOW I had the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of sausage. END
BEGIN NOW  As I already had half of a sticky bun, I thought I'd just order a couple of sides and skip a big entree. END
BEGIN NOW   The biscuit was quite large and it was flaky, tender and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW   It came with a nice amount of gravy. END
BEGIN NOW   The gravy was a little under seasoned, so I had to add some salt and pepper on top. END
BEGIN NOW   The sausages were perfect with the Biscuit and Gravy. END
BEGIN NOW   You can tell that the sausages were house made and thankfully they weren't salty. END
BEGIN NOW As for beverages, I ordered Coconut Thai Iced Tea and the hubby had the Decaf Highwire. END
BEGIN NOW   We brew Highwire Coffee at home, so we were happy to see that on their menu. END
BEGIN NOW   I was really glad they use coconut milk for their Thai Iced Tea. END
BEGIN NOW   It was really good, though I'd like to have a stronger tea flavor. END
BEGIN NOW There was a wait when we got there around 10:45. END
BEGIN NOW   We waited for about half hour. END
BEGIN NOW  They pretty much have a constant stream of diners, so expect to wait if you go here on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is very friendly and I really appreciate that everything is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW   We will definitely go back!. END
BEGIN NOW If you're in the neighborhood and the wait isn't crazy, check it out. END
BEGIN NOW We knew there wasn't a full espresso menu so put our names in and got lattes across the street at World Ground. END
BEGIN NOW  It made the wait of about 35 minutes enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW As others have said, there's another significant wait to get your order and it's loud inside but neither were a problem for us. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice not to be rushed and I enjoyed watching the openness of the kitchen prep area. END
BEGIN NOW The blood orange juice was delightfully tart. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm usually partial to big fluffy waffles but I was really digging the thin crispness of theirs. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes were smashed-style and solid. END
BEGIN NOW  The huevos rancheros with chorizo were overpowered by the bold flavor of the sauce but I do appreciate how they make everything in-house, including the meat. END
BEGIN NOW I really enjoyed coming here for their brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Thank goodness I came with friends so that I can taste their dish as well!. END
BEGIN NOW One thing I did not like was that we had to wait for an hour to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW  But then again, what do you expect for Sunday brunch right?!?. END
BEGIN NOW I order their coconut Thai iced tea and I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW  I believe my friend was indifferent about the drink though. END
BEGIN NOW  My hubby got the matcha almond iced latte and I thought it was OK but he liked it. END
BEGIN NOW  He did get less honey in the drink so if he got it the normal way, I probably would have liked it more. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered their Country Breakfast and that was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW  It came with a biscuit and sausage gravy, two eggs, greens, and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  The highlight for this entree was the biscuit since it was so freakin' moist, soft, buttery! I tried my friend's beef hash and I so liked his dish more than mine. END
BEGIN NOW I'd definitely come back here for their pastries, beef hash, and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW Sequoia, the new home of the now long-gone and super mediocre Full House, is a little gem of a hipster haven worth pushing past the throngs of screaming toddlers and hoards of impatient soon-to-be patrons for. END
BEGIN NOW  It's pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Serving up the usual diner fare with their own flare and fancy (and a bit of a price hike, juheard?), Sequoia aims to please by grabbing you in with something you're familiar with and getting a good grip on you with their unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  I usually storm the joint on a Sunday or Saturday morning with m'ladies, but today's dolo trip offered a more reflective experience and prompted me to step outside of my usual "two eggs and toast with avo on the side" comfort zone. END
BEGIN NOW I was surprised to find when I walked up around 10 A. END
BEGIN NOW M. END
BEGIN NOW  on a Wednesday that the diner already had a significant crowd outside. END
BEGIN NOW  They didn't have pitchforks just yet but they looked like they were hungry enough to turn into an angry mob. END
BEGIN NOW  Luckily, I signed in with the lovely hostess and was at a counter seat within ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  Once seated, I ordered a mimosa and decided today was the day I'd get jiggy with that Red Flannel Hash I had heard so much about and constantly peered over people's heads to get a better look at. END
BEGIN NOW  I also decided to forego the sliced sourdough in favor of a biscuit so I could finally weigh in on those, as I've heard they're pretty good here. END
BEGIN NOW My mimosa was sad and unimpressive, mostly because the orange juice seemed suspect. END
BEGIN NOW  But the Red Flannel Hash and the biscuit both surpassed my expectations! The Red Flannel Hash is one of those textural and flavor landscapes I live for: warm, crunchy, soft and runny meets savory, sweet, tart and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW  The pickled cabbage that comes with the hash is equal parts culinary genius and just damned good pairing for a poached egg and hash combo. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't really get into the sour cream glob on the side but I'm not a sour cream girl. END
BEGIN NOW The biscuit is just as buttery and flaky and scrumptious as you've heard. END
BEGIN NOW  But the nuances of seasonality scalded me: I got stuck with cranberry preserves, which were pretty gross. END
BEGIN NOW  Still, the biscuit remained sweet and resilient in the face of something so bitter, as we all should. END
BEGIN NOW  Life lessons, brought to you by Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW A great new spot for the best breakfast in town!  You gotta be patient though, as there is always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   Just put your name on the list and have a cuppa. END
BEGIN NOW Farm fresh greens and in house biscuits can't be beat!  I have tried the country breakfast and the Benedict - both excellent!  The potatoes are amazing and crispy _ you won't be disappointed!. END
BEGIN NOW If you have time for a leisurely wait and want your coffee cup "warmed up" as you hang out with the Laurel District gentrifiers, this is your spot. END
BEGIN NOW At prime time there's quite a wait and the parking shituation  is very competitive on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee? So-so. END
BEGIN NOW  Are you hungry? The kitchen isn't as speedy as it should be, but "have some more coffee. END
BEGIN NOW ". END
BEGIN NOW Been here a few times and this premium-priced trendy breakfast spot serves up great food but is a bit over-hyped. END
BEGIN NOW  The original vision is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopefully, they can get more efficient to make the wait and price with the visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Still, it's a four star cafe. END
BEGIN NOW 11/20/15. END
BEGIN NOW  Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW This feels like Valencia Street in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW  A diner serves modern twists of traditional breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  The well-lit space has a dining encounter, booths and tables. END
BEGIN NOW  The tables are also reminiscent of the city--they are packed pretty tight. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW *Golden Waffle ($7. END
BEGIN NOW 50) is thin eggo-like topped with candied apples. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the kind of waffle we prefer, not the thick Belgian kind. END
BEGIN NOW *Spinach and Mushroom Scramble ($12) is the only scramble on the menu so here it is. END
BEGIN NOW  It's perfectly done with runny scrambled egg woven evenly with spinach and fresh mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a cheese person usually but the Swiss is not overpowering and adds flavor to the egg. END
BEGIN NOW  Served with arugula salad, fried potato and a thick buttered toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Hearty and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee is constantly refilled. END
BEGIN NOW  It's from Hot Wire. END
BEGIN NOW  They also gave fresh-squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW  The homemade goods for the day are cranberry scone ($3) and pecan sticky bun ($3. END
BEGIN NOW 50) both of which are tempting. END
BEGIN NOW Berkeley appears to be bleeding into Oakland, as this locally owned and sourced cafe felt like a place you would expect to find about twenty minutes north of this location. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never been to Laurel before, but it's one of those transitional, culturally diverse neighborhoods where you could have a cup of artisan coffee one minute but you feel a need to keep staring at your car while it's parked on the street. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a Temescal-in-waiting, and if it does become the East Bay's next gourmet ghetto, you can thank the husband-and-wife team of Andrew Vennari and Sequoia Broderson who opened this comfy-cozy spot which drew quite a few for breakfast on Saturday morning (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1L2zRnZ). END
BEGIN NOW As usual in Oakland, I was done with my haircut and found myself here in a peckish state. END
BEGIN NOW  Although it was only about a ten-minute wait for me, I was surprised by the constant stream of people looking to dine here since it's fairly nondescript from the outside. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I could tell why the attraction by the eclectic selection of breakfasts on the menu including a $13 Huevos Rancheros and the same-priced Shakshuka, an Israeli-originated melange of squash, peppers, garbanzo beans, lebni (kefir cheese) and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  That all sounded appetizing, but I adhered to the Patriot Act and ordered the all-American-sounding Beef Hash (also $13), certainly not a Hormel Mary Kitchen canned creation by any stretch. END
BEGIN NOW It consisted of shredded slow-braised beef chuck mashed up and fried on the griddle with potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  You could barely see it on the plate because it was covered by big shavings of raw carrots, arugula and a pair of poached eggs with homemade rye toast on the side (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1WEvNpS). END
BEGIN NOW  It looked almost downright healthy but not really, just tasty in a Berkeley commune kind of way with a bit of a kick from a dusting of horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW  As much as I like this dish - and I did - I have to admit it was overshadowed by the sheer flakiness of the freshly baked $3. END
BEGIN NOW 25 Strawberry Scone (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1NieroA). END
BEGIN NOW  Worth every penny and perfectly complemented by the slightly overpriced $2. END
BEGIN NOW 75 cup of Highwire Coffee (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1Nz1w6h). END
BEGIN NOW  Now where is Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW bold, fresh flavors for such dinerish fare with a standout scone. END
BEGIN NOW AMBIANCE - 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW nice, all-white interior (I mean the walls, not the people. END
BEGIN NOW sort of) in a neighborhood still looking for its identity. END
BEGIN NOW SERVICE - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW very friendly and attentive server. END
BEGIN NOW TOTAL - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW coming back for the Shakshuka. END
BEGIN NOW but seriously, where's Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW Everything we have ordered came out delicious! The sticky buns were made so you can dream about them when you are hungry ! it s packed up weekends but the best time is during the week. END
BEGIN NOW  I am soon happy this dinner is in the Laurel district a few blocks from my house. END
BEGIN NOW Good job!. END
BEGIN NOW When my old roommate from college decided she wanted eggs for breakfast, Montclair Egg Shop seemed like a very logical answer to her hunger. END
BEGIN NOW  There ended up being a 40 minute wait when we showed up at 12 pm on a Saturday, but that led us to exploring the area for the first time (spoiler: there isn't much to do, but there IS a really good bookstore in the area). END
BEGIN NOW THE BASICS. END
BEGIN NOW + It's a very old-fashioned sort of place, like a dusty diner, but in the best possible way. END
BEGIN NOW + At least 50% of the menu (if not more) focuses on eggs (logically so) - meaning you should really order something with eggs. END
BEGIN NOW + Service is pretty fast considering how slammed they get for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW + Their egg creations are quite good (egg shop ham & cheese potato pancakes ftw). END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of amazing that this place has been around and in business for 42 years - definitely a solid place!. END
BEGIN NOW thought my friend meant "eggslut" when he suggested this place, but either way it's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was Antonio and he's just the sweetest thing; genuinely cared about our time there. END
BEGIN NOW It took me a while to order because I couldn't decide between the french toast or the crêpes, but I thoroughly enjoyed my french toast. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is quaint and mellow, much like the rest of the street outside. END
BEGIN NOW All in all: service was great, brunch was lovely, and despite their lack of variety in coffee, I definitely recommend this place. END
BEGIN NOW Ah the egg shop. END
BEGIN NOW  This place seems like an iconic part of Montclair. END
BEGIN NOW The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW  We came here after my best friend had a minor surgery, and were immediately greeted warmly and seated. END
BEGIN NOW  The hostess took our drink orders, and when we hadn't received them by the time our waiter showed up, he immediately ran to do it himself. END
BEGIN NOW  Very cool. END
BEGIN NOW  To the hostesses' credit, it was super busy, and she apologized. END
BEGIN NOW The food is. END
BEGIN NOW okay. END
BEGIN NOW  I opted for chilequiles and was a bit disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  For one, the eggs were over soft- no choice as to how to cook them, and the salsa was bland. END
BEGIN NOW  The quest fresco was rubbery. END
BEGIN NOW  I went from excited to "I can barely eat this" pretty quickly. END
BEGIN NOW My best friend got a large waffle with whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW  She said it was pretty damned good. END
BEGIN NOW  Portion sizes are relatively large. END
BEGIN NOW Basic breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing fancy. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't think I'd spend the money to come back. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice people working here though. END
BEGIN NOW  The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW Ohmygoodness!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is beyond cute. END
BEGIN NOW  It's located in their cute little downtown. END
BEGIN NOW Has a "small-town" vibe to it. END
BEGIN NOW Walking in - the décor reminded me of Leavenworth in WA - Bavarian. END
BEGIN NOW  SUPER CUTE!. END
BEGIN NOW You sign-in at the notepad they have at the podium & have a seat. END
BEGIN NOW There isn't necessarily a hostess - someone behind the counter, cooking was the one that told me to put my name down. END
BEGIN NOW We were seated immediately - there was no one in front of us - so that could be lucky for us. END
BEGIN NOW There is ample seating & the restaurant looks a lot smaller than it really is. END
BEGIN NOW They took our drink orders quickly but took a little longer to take our food orders. END
BEGIN NOW The food did come quickly though - a PLUS in case you're super hungry. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered one of their specials - Garden Omelet which had asparagus, zucchini, spinach, & a bunch of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW I honestly took a couple bites & knew that it wasn't my cup o' tea. END
BEGIN NOW My whole omelet tasted like asparagus. END
BEGIN NOW  Sure, it wouldn't bother me so much but it was just really bland -_-. END
BEGIN NOW No flavor whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! I substituted the potato fries for fruit - as usual it cost extra. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my friend ordered bacon on the side & they charged her 4 dollars. END
BEGIN NOW  Just FYI. END
BEGIN NOW All in all - I wasn't really impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Sad to say, I took the omelet home but pretty much threw it away & made my own omelet. END
BEGIN NOW One of thine partner in crimes and I had a hankering for a tasty brunch experience and a tall glass'a mimosa to start our New Year off right. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not ashamed to admit that I called several other eateries first to see how long the wait time was (and whether they served alcohol) before we ended up here. END
BEGIN NOW  The wait was about 35 minutes, giving us plenty of time to determine what we would be eating before we were seated. END
BEGIN NOW I chose two eggs scrambled with jack cheese, home fries, an english muffin and a side of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  My accomplice dined on the Egg Shop's signature Ham, Cheese & Potato Pancake, which comes with scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  With the exception of my "Home Fried Potatoes", the meal was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes were greasy, undercooked and inedible so I didn't touch them. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend said that her potato pancake was good and didn't suffer from the grease problem that my home freezies did. END
BEGIN NOW  The jealousy was flagrant but I was still happy for her. END
BEGIN NOW  Plus I was too focused on the delicious pomegranate mimosa in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW Our server was Adolfo and he was totally attentive, super sweet and didn't make us feel rushed or act irritated even though by the time we were seated the place was pretty much closed. END
BEGIN NOW  And who wouldn't want to get the hell out of their job on New Year's Day? Thanks again!. END
BEGIN NOW I had the Belgium waffle topped with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream with a side of eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything was delicious, but I had to knock a star off because their coffee was not my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW  It was bitter and just seemed old. END
BEGIN NOW  It didn't taste like a freshly brewed cup of coffee and that dented my eating experience a bit. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd like to bring my own in the future without being judged. END
BEGIN NOW The price was great, the ambiance was really cute. END
BEGIN NOW  There's writing on the ceiling and behind the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  Really neat place. END
BEGIN NOW Like any good brunch spot, there was a wait and for some reason my cell service was not the best here so talk amongst yourselves. END
BEGIN NOW  hahaha And don't give up on checking in!!. END
BEGIN NOW The service here is always wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW  All the servers and hosts are super friendly with their guests and each other. END
BEGIN NOW I always order something different but I love their "make your own" omelets. END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee is good too. END
BEGIN NOW  I think it'd be super cute if the upstairs were open for eating too because there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW  But whatever, it's never more than a 15 minute wait. END
BEGIN NOW  You know this place must be great if the neighboring restaurants are usually empty while people are waiting to eat here. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely a favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW So I wanted to try a new place and this place had good reviews and the food pics looked great. END
BEGIN NOW  The main thing I wanted to get was the pancakes, but by the time the server came to take our order they "ran out" of pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW  How do you run out of pancakes? Can't you just make more batter?. END
BEGIN NOW Going in it has a very rustic welcoming feel. END
BEGIN NOW  The red brick walls and fireplace makes it more personable. END
BEGIN NOW  Most tables are 2 seaters so because there were 4 of us we were seated in the back. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice and quiet. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the Egg Shop Ham&Cheese Potato Pancake and hubby got the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW  The potato pancake is basically hash browns with ham and cheese which I was looking forward to. END
BEGIN NOW  Unfortunately I was informed it has cilantro which it doesn't state on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  It also didn't state it contains onions and green onions which I discovered after taking my first bite. END
BEGIN NOW  That's about when my gag reflex kicked in. END
BEGIN NOW  Me and onions don't like each other. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd never have ordered it if it said those 2 items were in there. END
BEGIN NOW  Ended up eating my daughter's French toast while she ate the hubby's side order of Belgian waffle. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah they can make waffles but not pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW Hubby was not impressed by the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW  It was ok but was more potatoes and veggies than corned beef. END
BEGIN NOW Their soft drinks were a cup of ice with a soda can so no "refills". END
BEGIN NOW  At $1. END
BEGIN NOW 50-$2. END
BEGIN NOW 50 a can I opted for water. END
BEGIN NOW A little pricey but ok for just me and hubby. END
BEGIN NOW  Not a place we'd bring the kids because our kids eat more than their serving size. END
BEGIN NOW  Lol. END
BEGIN NOW All in all it was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW  I might try it again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it and I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone just yet. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe next time. END
BEGIN NOW maybe. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious french toast and Belgian waffles :). END
BEGIN NOW  With fresh strawberries and whipped cream! Their orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and all of their servers were very nice!! The ambience was chill and kind of eccentric but I liked it! Clowns and trains, and old timey things. END
BEGIN NOW  My only complaint! Was one particularly creepy waiter who worked there and hit on me and my sister and stared every time he walked by. END
BEGIN NOW  Not what I'm looking for with my breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW A little disappointed in this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here on a Sunday at 10:30am. END
BEGIN NOW  Limited street parking because there is a farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW  Also took 30 mins to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW  Guess it's the only joint in town. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered the Benedict with crab cake and also the bloody mary with sake. END
BEGIN NOW  My benedict was very disapponting. END
BEGIN NOW  Eggs were overcooked. END
BEGIN NOW  When I cut into them, the yolk was cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  Also there was avocado skin in my meal that should have been thrown out and random peices of corn?? As for the bloody mary, there was nothing special tasting about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, had high hopes, but the meal was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW Came here on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW   It was packed and there was a long wait. END
BEGIN NOW   Food and service were both good. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Very good!  Nice spot, highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW Omg. END
BEGIN NOW  Their jam though. END
BEGIN NOW  Homemade. END
BEGIN NOW Apricot jam. END
BEGIN NOW  I wanted to steal the whole jar haha! I always get their scramble which is nicely done. END
BEGIN NOW  The eggs are in the runnier side and that's the way I like my eggs! It was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW I feel conflicted about giving this place only 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I have nothing but good memories at this neighborhood place (used to come here in high school). END
BEGIN NOW  The service was wonderful but the food was pretty mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW  My eggs benedict was soggy from the generous amount of hollandaise. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't get me wrong, I love hollandaise with all my heart, but there is such a thing as too much. END
BEGIN NOW  I could also tell that the crab cake had a ton of filler/binder. END
BEGIN NOW  Kind of a nitpicky complaint, but my avocado slices were bruised (at least cut away the bruised parts). END
BEGIN NOW  Bf really liked his potato pancakes though. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfectly crisp and seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW  Food here is like diner food but better, but only a little better. END
BEGIN NOW  The plastic plates and dingy cups don't help. END
BEGIN NOW We typically go here for breakfast meetings and it is never a disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a variety of breakfast items to choose from, whether you have a hankering for a standard 2 eggs and bacon breakfast or maybe a sweeter dish like waffles, or more ethnic dish like breakfast tacos, they have it here!. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday I ordered the breakfast tacos which honestly is the best deal. END
BEGIN NOW   For 8. END
BEGIN NOW 95, you get two tacos with greens, bacon, and eggs how you want it, covered with salsa and a side of half an avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   As you can see from the picture, it's a huge dish!. END
BEGIN NOW Great flavor and fast service. END
BEGIN NOW   On the weekends though, there may be a wait. END
BEGIN NOW  But, totally worth it!. END
BEGIN NOW +/- THE FOOD. END
BEGIN NOW I had really high expectations for this place seeing that it was so packed when I went. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the chicken apple sausage scramble and a pomegranate mimosa and it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW  The scramble was rather bland and didn't have any attributes that stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW  The mimosa was definitely 80% champagne and 20% juice. END
BEGIN NOW  I tasted no pomegranate whatosever. END
BEGIN NOW  I also tried my friend's regular orange mimosa and same thing- too much champagne. END
BEGIN NOW + THE ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW The place is absolutely adorable. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like you stepped into a little cottage from a storybook. END
BEGIN NOW  The restaurant is neatly decorated with a bunch of gadgets and gizmos like toy trains and inspirational quotes on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is pretty small but very clean. END
BEGIN NOW We went to the Montclair Egg Shop this week for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW  I was hungry so I ordered the challah bread French toast and an omelette with bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, and jack cheese. END
BEGIN NOW The omelette was your standard size and was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  The French toast was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread was too flat/thin and it tasted just okay. END
BEGIN NOW The prices were good and the service was good as well. END
BEGIN NOW  We will return!. END
BEGIN NOW Breakfast of Champions! You know it's that good if you saw Andre Iguodala enjoying his breakfast while you were here. END
BEGIN NOW  Shared the potato pancake and salmon scramble, both were delicious and hearty. END
BEGIN NOW NBA Finals MVP approved! #StrengthInNumbers #NBAChamps #Warriors. END
BEGIN NOW Service is good. END
BEGIN NOW Nice atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW Attractive interior. END
BEGIN NOW If you are into America style breakfast no doubt it suits to your pallet. END
BEGIN NOW Vs decent European breakfast places eg in the nicer parts of London, there is way more sugar and other high glycogen index ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW  such ingredients are not too my taste, leave me feeling bloated and of course contributes to putting on weight. END
BEGIN NOW scrambled eggs with salmon:-- like most America breakfast the egg was more like an omelet chopped up. END
BEGIN NOW  The salmon is mixed in to the egg, which also makes it more difficult to cook to the best consistency. END
BEGIN NOW old fashioned oaks:-- expecting big fat Scottish rolled oats which typically have lots of flavour, but found them to be more like typical modern rolled oats. END
BEGIN NOW  I asked for no sugar but there was shed loads of both brown sugar and honey. END
BEGIN NOW  It was sweeter than a pudding. END
BEGIN NOW  The oats were also overlooked and had lost all there lost form. END
BEGIN NOW they kindly took it back and brought me a version with no sugar or honey and the oats were less cooked. END
BEGIN NOW Mocha:- pleasant but massive(full size tall  glass) too sweet, suspect they use the chocolate syrup as couldn't taste much cocoa. END
BEGIN NOW All in all pretty consistent with other American breakfast places I've been to above average atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be making my own breakfast until I discover a decent place. END
BEGIN NOW Came here a second time for dinner instead of brunch this time. END
BEGIN NOW DRINKS- Plaid on plaid drink was so good! Love those egg white drinks, and they do it well here. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD- Tried their famous fried chicken, and it was soooo juicy!! I was surprised. END
BEGIN NOW  Just wish there were more vegetables since they only gave 2 pieces of asparagus with 2 giant fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW ATMOSPHERE- modern, restaurant is small inside, so we sat outside which was quite nice. END
BEGIN NOW  Lively neighborhood to grab dinner at. END
BEGIN NOW OVERALL- Awesome restaurant!. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry to be late in posting this. END
BEGIN NOW life gets in the way, especially when one is remodeling [smile]. END
BEGIN NOW After a lovely 2014 Holiday Series dinner, the 2015 Holiday Series dinner, which essentially promised the same menu of various goose dishes, was a real letdown. END
BEGIN NOW  Cost-cutting undermined  the once-lovely appetizer plate, which had a similar trio of dishes but was less generous,less interesting, and more green salad than anything else. END
BEGIN NOW Entree dish was salty (confit; insufficiently rinsed) and greasy (potatoes). END
BEGIN NOW  The breast meat was chewy even tho sliced thin, and a touch overseasoned with thyme. END
BEGIN NOW  Grilled escarole was a nice bitter element but the plate was surprisingly dull-looking, especially compared to prior year's plate where bright Fuyu persimmons provided a lovely accent in both color and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Hopscotch's dessert menu is annoyingly banal. END
BEGIN NOW  In an area filled with great pastry chefs, offering mud pie or donuts is disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  We tried the latter, which were dull and served with a too-sweet butterscotch cream. END
BEGIN NOW  It has no depth, and since the donuts are just fried dough, a little something more interesting is needed than just additional sugar on top of grease and flour. END
BEGIN NOW Overall: a big miss which left us sad. END
BEGIN NOW  Itani's one of Oakland's premier groundbreaking chefs, but we're finding better food elsewhere these days. END
BEGIN NOW Meat-heavy, drink-heavy. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite diner decor, this is for people who know little about food. END
BEGIN NOW  Mel's in SF makes this place look sick. END
BEGIN NOW  Thunderously noisy, even though there's not many tables. END
BEGIN NOW  Travesty. END
BEGIN NOW  Little pieces of heavily battered fish. END
BEGIN NOW  Much vaunted duck fat chips are a waste of $2. END
BEGIN NOW  There are many places where duck fat fries are worth the upcharge. END
BEGIN NOW Hopscotch is not one of them. END
BEGIN NOW  The three of us compared them head-to-head with the regular fries, and found very, very, very scant difference. END
BEGIN NOW  Both regular and duck fat were slightly too greasy; we like our chips a bit crisper. END
BEGIN NOW  The batter was the extra-crispy style, which Spouse dislikes, and was fried so hard and so long that even the dark meat was dried out. END
BEGIN NOW  It also had the dessicated look of fried food that had been sitting around, although he said it was very hot all the way through. END
BEGIN NOW  He did like the raw pickled cauliflower florets with it, however. END
BEGIN NOW  Burger unsalted (big NO-NO) and didn't cover the bun. END
BEGIN NOW  Slice of tongue was super-tiny and dried out. END
BEGIN NOW  Pork belly griddled so it was just chewy thick bacon, much ado about nothing. END
BEGIN NOW  The bun was good, but buttered before grilling, making it greasy. END
BEGIN NOW  Adding mayo and aioli just made it even greasier. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered medium-rare, but came medium. END
BEGIN NOW  No option for cheese, highly irritating because this puppy needed some salt (and I don't often say that, being on 20 yrs of low-salt diet!). END
BEGIN NOW  Needed a whole lot more of those pickled onions to get any flavor through all the oil slick. END
BEGIN NOW Iced tea was a very strange black tea/sassafras blend. END
BEGIN NOW  Does anybody seriously think weak flat root beer flavoring makes good iced tea???  But the ginger limeade was superb. END
BEGIN NOW  By itself, however, one good juice drink isn't enough to be worth the schlep out here. END
BEGIN NOW Try Spice Monkey for fish'n'chips, Pican or Bistro 1491 for fried chicken, and anywhere else for a burger. END
BEGIN NOW If only yelp allowed half stars, 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5 would be my true rating. END
BEGIN NOW Service. END
BEGIN NOW Came here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW  Love the ambience. END
BEGIN NOW  Small, cozy space. END
BEGIN NOW  Restaurant was slow. END
BEGIN NOW  Walked in. END
BEGIN NOW  No hostess. END
BEGIN NOW  Then she appeared behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Attended to a customer who had a takeout order, but neglected to greet us afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW  Had to approach her to ask, "Do we seat ourselves?". END
BEGIN NOW  Unenthusiastically, she responded, "No, I will. END
BEGIN NOW " Half star ticked right off for that!. END
BEGIN NOW The server was friendly, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't stand when a waiter asks you five times in 10 min intervals, "How is everything?". END
BEGIN NOW There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant and they are dog friendly, yay!! My friend asked the server for some chicken for the dog and (although it took a while. END
BEGIN NOW ) he came back with perfectly grilled slices of chicken (4 bucks a breast). END
BEGIN NOW  The food came out in a timely manner, but our additional order of the two Yonsei Oysters were lagging and we even thought that that it might have been forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW  There were only three other tables at this time. END
BEGIN NOW  Another half star ticked off!. END
BEGIN NOW Food. END
BEGIN NOW Start-Little Green Salad with butter lettuce, baby kale, (shaved) celery, hazelnuts, soft sheeps cheese, Sherry vinaigrette: (warning: it's truly starter size and takes four full bites to eat. END
BEGIN NOW ) Some bites were overly salted and others under. END
BEGIN NOW  The sheeps cheese was the star. END
BEGIN NOW  Greens were crisp and can't hate on those toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW  Last half star ticked off for this one!. END
BEGIN NOW Main-Buttermilk Fried Chicken with black sesame asparagus: DAMN, that crusty, crunchy, flakey, party in yo mouth chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW  Tell me your secrets! It's a GIANT chicken drumstick+thigh. END
BEGIN NOW  The meat itself was well cooked over a bed of cabbage slaw. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally, topped with two grilled asparagus (keepin those expectations realistic!). END
BEGIN NOW  Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but pretty darn good. END
BEGIN NOW Side-Yonsei Oysters with sea urchin, salmon roe and citrus: Real fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW  These were the good ones. END
BEGIN NOW  Little sweet oysters. END
BEGIN NOW  Gotta love that sea brine. END
BEGIN NOW  More citrus than soy, but how can you go wrong that roe and sea urchin??! A dozen more please!. END
BEGIN NOW I really wanted to like this place for brunch but only had an ok experience. END
BEGIN NOW Warning:. END
BEGIN NOW We asked for another cup with a new pot and tasted just as bad. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems like no AC so expect to sweat on a warm day. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't imagine in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW Now to food. END
BEGIN NOW 1. END
BEGIN NOW  Buttermilk fried chicken - crispy, juicy, fresh and hot. END
BEGIN NOW  Chicken and gravy were the best part of my brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  However, biscuit was hard and chewy. END
BEGIN NOW  Side of fruits tasted sour and old :( Also no choice on how you want your eggs when you order this dish. END
BEGIN NOW  Only scrambled. END
BEGIN NOW 2. END
BEGIN NOW  Mushroom Benedict - lacks flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Need a lil truffle oil or something to enhance the shiitake mushrooms and need to reduce the cream on the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW 3. END
BEGIN NOW  Donuts - good but really small for the portion. END
BEGIN NOW only 3 mini round donuts. END
BEGIN NOW  Gotta split the 3rd :/. END
BEGIN NOW Honestly don't know if I'll try this place again. END
BEGIN NOW  Tempted to go back and order the Benedict with pork belly but not sure I can convince the BF to give it another shot. END
BEGIN NOW This is a cute, trendy spot in Uptown Oakland where customers ranging from college students to older, more mature patrons come to dine. END
BEGIN NOW  It is a tiny restaurant, but there is seating both inside and outside, and the decorations are spot-on. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu changes for lunch and dinner, and are limited to about 5-7 offerings, and is on the pricey side. END
BEGIN NOW I came here once for brunch and another time for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW My favorite is the yonsei oysters, which includes salmon roe and uni on the half shell, a perfect Asian fusion dish. END
BEGIN NOW  They taste fresh and complex. END
BEGIN NOW  One second you taste the salty juices of the roe, then you taste the sweet briny freshness of the uni, followed by the cool ocean flavor of the oysters. END
BEGIN NOW  The portions are a bit small but they are definitely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW For brunch, I had the braised pork belly benedict. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork belly was cooked perfectly, crunchy and tender at the right places. END
BEGIN NOW  The hollandaise sauce was the right amount of creamy and citrusy. END
BEGIN NOW  I liked that it was a well-executed twist on a classic brunch platter. END
BEGIN NOW However, I did not like the dinner dishes as much. END
BEGIN NOW  They seemed a bit too average for the price you pay. END
BEGIN NOW  Granted, I'm sure they use the most high quality and the freshest ingredients, but at $19 for a plate of pasta and $22 for clams, I sort of expect something out of this world. END
BEGIN NOW The soba bucatini is very tomatoey but tastes just a bit better than the average pasta, though the green beans do add a nice crunch. END
BEGIN NOW  The manila clams were yummy and it came with a deep-fried vegetable that paired well with the seafood tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I felt the prices were too high for what my bf and I got. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, this is a nice little date spot, but much more so for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a bar and serve all types of alcohol, so it's great for boozey brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Any chance to try a new brunch place is gladly taken - #brunchsohard! We heard this place has a better brunch menu than dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a very small location but there's apparently more seating next door! You can make reservations too, so definitely plan ahead. END
BEGIN NOW Everything on their menu was tempting - American brunch fare with a Korean twist, what better combination could there be!? I just had to go for the kimchee fried rice with shoyu eggs and pork belly. END
BEGIN NOW  Tender, flavorful, spicy and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW every bite was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  We also got to try the donuts with butterscotch cream (it should be a sin to have this for breakfast) and the cinnamon challah toast with jam (how is this so soft?!). END
BEGIN NOW  I had a bite of their famous fried chicken and biscuits for whatever room was left in my stomach and wow it was not your typical chicken and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW Based on my experience today, you will not be disappointed no matter what you order. END
BEGIN NOW  Wish we had this place closer to home. END
BEGIN NOW I'd be ordering that kimchee fried rice on a weekly basis. END
BEGIN NOW I went with a Yonsei Oyster and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken--both were good, but both items are way overpriced which disallows me from giving this place anymore than 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything else about the experience here was outstanding except the $23 chicken that didn't even come with a carb on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  That dish is worth $13-$15 at most. END
BEGIN NOW  It was literally just some fried chicken (sure, dredged in their signature marinade of buttermilk, soy sauce, and potato starch), some asparagus, and chrysanthemum salad with vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW  The chicken was juicy and tasty but it wasn't even a decent size--was still hungry after. END
BEGIN NOW  You can argue that this one dish alone isn't supposed to fill you up however I think that the very essence of fried chicken is a comfort food that serves the purpose of filling you up and if someone wants to make it extra special, he/she can do that, but he/she doesn't need to make it so fancy it becomes small and too expensive. END
BEGIN NOW  It's fried chicken, how much extra does your buttermilk and soy sauce cost? This isn't Napa where you're surrounded by million dollar wineries. END
BEGIN NOW  I can understand overpriced oysters, but $23 fried chicken in Oakland? You've got to be kidding me. END
BEGIN NOW Since I wasn't fully satisfied, I had to go to Belly down the street which is where I should've went to in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW  Literally, if they just added something like mashed or scalloped potatoes, this dish would be on point. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not sure why everyone raves about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Furthermore, I've never complained about negative space on a dish but even from the consumer point of view, the dish didn't come together well looks-wise. END
BEGIN NOW  It'll leave you hanging like, "where's the rest of my food?" The oyster was pretty delicious, but not worth $5. END
BEGIN NOW So, I honestly would recommend checking out Hopscotch and I want to come back someday to give it another try, but please do yourself a favor and refrain from ordering that fried chicken--you're better off going to 'insert-your-favorite-fast-food-fried-chicken-joint here'. END
BEGIN NOW On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and it's a cozy unique atmosphere that defines the rising Oakland food scene. END
BEGIN NOW  I believe it might be best to make reservations if you're anticipating to come with friends during peak eating times. END
BEGIN NOW I have to say Hopscotch has a pretty delicious brunch! This was my first time brunching in Oakland as opposed to SF, and it was pretty positive overall. END
BEGIN NOW  The setup of the restaurant is a little confusing, as there are two separate rooms separated by a convenience store in the middle. END
BEGIN NOW  We dined in the second room, which I actually thought had a nicer and more spacious layout. END
BEGIN NOW We started off the meal with some mimosas and the Donuts and Butterscotch Cream. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely try these because they're super warm and fluffy, and the butterscotch is so good you'll literally want to bottle it and take it home! We decided to split a couple of the entrees, so we ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Biscuits, which had a really tasty gravy drizzled on top. END
BEGIN NOW  The biscuit was nice and flaky and you can tell it's homemade. END
BEGIN NOW  We also got the Kimchee Fried Rice with pork belly, which was the standout of the meal for me. END
BEGIN NOW  The rice was really authentic, and I loved the addition of the jidori eggs!. END
BEGIN NOW I've heard Hopscotch also has a delicious dinner menu, so I'd definitely come back to check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW The combination of Beer (hops) and Scotch is already awesome but add gastro pub grub and you have the makings of a winner! The place is split into two separate rooms that are surrounding some other business so that's a bit strange at first. END
BEGIN NOW  The main room where the hostess is located is quite small and I was wondering if we were going to fit. END
BEGIN NOW  After a very short walk to their "annex" as they called it, we were pleased to find more larger tables and room for our party of four. END
BEGIN NOW  Both rooms were sparsely decorated and appeared that the building was from the early 1900s, it had a cozy feel. END
BEGIN NOW I had to start with a Hop / Scotch Pairing. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the Nikka Coffee Whiskey paired with Fort Point Charred Manzanita Red Ale ($14). END
BEGIN NOW  The Scotch was served neat with both water and ice on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  I popped a single rock into the scotch to open it up a bit and proceeded to sip back and forth off the two enjoying how the flavors played off each other in harmony. END
BEGIN NOW The menu is spartan with only 5 entree offerings and 6 starter options. END
BEGIN NOW  My wife had the ribs and I got to try one, they were quite good. END
BEGIN NOW  They were tender but not too tender, seasoned well and served with Japanese Sweet Potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the "First Base" Burger. END
BEGIN NOW  It was a blend of house ground chuck and beef tongue. END
BEGIN NOW  Now beef tongue is not usually something I seek out but I was feeling adventurous. END
BEGIN NOW  I took a chance and ordered it medium rare on the waitresses suggestion and unfortunately is came out about as rare as I've ever seen a burger. END
BEGIN NOW  I still ate it and it was tasty but I learned my lesson, medium for burgers, medium rare for steaks. END
BEGIN NOW  I added the house cured bacon and some cheddar cheese to my burger and that put it @ $20. END
BEGIN NOW  The $20 burger was served with some house made kennebec potato chips, it would have cost $4 more to substitute fries. END
BEGIN NOW Price was my major gripe at this place (besides the uber rare meat), our bill was over $60 for the 2 of us and I had a burger! I'm not from the area so when I come back to town I will likely not return but it's worth trying at least once. END
BEGIN NOW First time here for brunch, heard it was good but no expectations. END
BEGIN NOW  We started with the Wasabi Bloody Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a big Bloody Mary person but these totally hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Just the right level of heat and spice. END
BEGIN NOW Then the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW  You know when you have a bite of food and everyone goes quiet and looks at each other? Especially with a group that is usually not quiet? And then the conversation shifts to "What would be your last meal?" because the plate in front of you is now in the running? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  Get the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW Oh God and then the main course. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the fried chicken with the sausage gravy on the side, poached eggs, biscuit and (mostly decorative) fruit and salad. END
BEGIN NOW  This is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  And the gravy with the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW  Ugh. END
BEGIN NOW  I am still thinking about it 3 days later. END
BEGIN NOW The service was friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  Took a while to get our food, especially considering the place was mostly empty on a late Saturday afternoon, but I guess you can't rush perfection. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW Any bar/restaurant that offers happy hour on a Saturday has a very, very special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW  Especially when their happy hour menu includes $7 cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  Our bartender made the most amazing whiskey sours - he put egg white in them, so they were frothy and almost creamy. END
BEGIN NOW The food is ah-mazing too. END
BEGIN NOW  Holy crap, this is a f*cking good hamburger. END
BEGIN NOW  The patty is so, so juicy and you can really taste that it's freshly made because the meat just crumbles in juicy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW  Fries are thick and soft and they give you this tangy orange aioli to dip them in. END
BEGIN NOW  It paired reallllly well with our whiskey sours. END
BEGIN NOW The ambiance is old-timey and incredibly charming. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopscotch has a second, disconnected room over from Subway (can we just get rid of the Subway?!) that we were seated in. END
BEGIN NOW  One entire wall is a cream-colored tufted leather booth. END
BEGIN NOW  It feels like something out of the golden age of jazz. END
BEGIN NOW Service is remarkably friendly and made for a very comfortable experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Love love love Hopscotch. END
BEGIN NOW Oh hey, you can get a bucket of fried chicken to-go too :). END
BEGIN NOW A friend who knows I like fried chicken said I had to come here and try their buttermilk fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   $18 for half a chicken, she said. END
BEGIN NOW   At those prices, it'd better be some chicken, I said. END
BEGIN NOW In the first place, it isn't half a chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   (To be fair to the restaurant, they don't say it is. END
BEGIN NOW )  It's two pieces, a boneless breast and a drumstick (not boneless), sort of melded together with a bridge of excess breading. END
BEGIN NOW   When it was served, I was told "the only bone is in the drumstick", which suggested that there might be at least a boneless thigh or a boneless wing in there somewhere, but there wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW The breading was very crunchy and very thick. END
BEGIN NOW   It had an interesting seasoning, that was its best point. END
BEGIN NOW   It was quite tolerable with the thick, not particularly moist breast meat. END
BEGIN NOW   Once I'd eaten that, though, the breading became overwhelming, and I was glad there wasn't any more. END
BEGIN NOW After leaving here, I drove up Telegraph and went past a Church's, and I thought: I could have gotten twice as much fried chicken, just as good and with less heavy breading, for half as much money, if I'd gone here instead. END
BEGIN NOW One of the rare times my wife and I agreed that a restaurant was 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW I had the burger. END
BEGIN NOW  It was perfectly done, juicy, and tasted amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  One of the best burgers I've had. END
BEGIN NOW  It was worth the $14. END
BEGIN NOW My wife had the ribs, which she loved. END
BEGIN NOW  The meat came off the bone very easily, and the sauce was quite flavorful (and a bit smokey, which she liked). END
BEGIN NOW  She was also very happy with the cocktail she had (an interesting tropical and smokey flavor combo). END
BEGIN NOW We also really enjoyed the mud pie. END
BEGIN NOW No complaints!. END
BEGIN NOW Food to die for and a counter to die at. END
BEGIN NOW Brunch could be wonderful, but you can't eat comfortably at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW  The stools have no foot rest and you get a climbing Halfdome experience clinging to the 2 inch rail the provide. END
BEGIN NOW NOTE TO READER: Before I get my head chopped off by other yelpers. END
BEGIN NOW  (This has happened before) I am about to go on a 14 hour flight, out of the country. END
BEGIN NOW  During this flight I have nothing to do and I know I have slacked on my reviewing because I have been crazy busy! Although every time I have gone somewhere new I made it a point to check-in so I may go back and review later. END
BEGIN NOW  It has taken me a while to review these restaurants but I am finally doing so. END
BEGIN NOW  Before somebody says "you posted x9843058048 reviews in one day", please know that I am reviewing as my flight is in the air and will be posting once landed at my destination. END
BEGIN NOW  Thank you! Also, I review on trip advisor before anybody goes psycho crazy on me saying they seen this review elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW  I post on both yelp and trip advisor of my reviews! Thank you (:. END
BEGIN NOW Location: Downtown Oakland, street parking!. END
BEGIN NOW Customer Service: Fast and welcoming!. END
BEGIN NOW Decor: Small restaurant but cutesy atmosphere, we sat at the table top seating where the small bar is at. END
BEGIN NOW Presentation of Food: ---. END
BEGIN NOW How did the food taste?: FIRST BASE BURGER WITH GRIDDLED BEEF TONGUE. END
BEGIN NOW  That's all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW  AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW Overall Experience: Good!. END
BEGIN NOW Would I Come Back?: Yes!! Hell Yes!. END
BEGIN NOW When my daughter flew in from Orlando, she was hungry. END
BEGIN NOW   So, we decided to eat something small. END
BEGIN NOW   Hence, we came to Oakland Grill. END
BEGIN NOW   We were here a few times, but I never got a chance to write a review until now. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the waffle with 2 eggs, and 2 bacons. END
BEGIN NOW   When they brought the plate, it was a large portion. END
BEGIN NOW   Good side for 2 people. END
BEGIN NOW   My daughter and I shared a plate. END
BEGIN NOW The food wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW   Can't really go wrong with breakfast, unless it's Dennys. END
BEGIN NOW   For the most part, it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I like their service. END
BEGIN NOW   Very friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW   The ambience wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW   It can get very busy during the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW   Be prepare for it. END
BEGIN NOW Rating:. END
BEGIN NOW Food:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Service:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Price:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Ambience:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Overall:  4. END
BEGIN NOW I would come back over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW We got lucky with parking for a Sunday but we did look for around 10 mins. END
BEGIN NOW Wait was super quick for a Sunday at 11:30, the guy who seated us was awesome!. END
BEGIN NOW Get to a cute table, given menus. END
BEGIN NOW Waitress comes and is stank in the face, I can tell this will be fun, no hello, no nothing, just :. END
BEGIN NOW "What would you like? ". END
BEGIN NOW The food was expensive for what it is but hey that's trendy Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW I would have at least had an egg that was cooked to order. END
BEGIN NOW  ( picture added ). END
BEGIN NOW I got attitude for being allergic to pineapple, had no idea pancakes come with a side of fruit as it's not mentioned on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sad! My boyfriend loves Eggs Benny and his would have been really easy place to help him get his fix. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! Family could not stop telling me about the crab cakes, and they were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Serving size here is stupendous. END
BEGIN NOW   Staff here is really nice, and our waitress was so attentive. END
BEGIN NOW We split the crab cake benedict and pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW   The apple sausage is worth trying. END
BEGIN NOW I love a breakfast place like this. END
BEGIN NOW   The atmosphere is just relaxed and warm. END
BEGIN NOW I came with a bigger group of 6 and had about a 25 minute wait which is a lot faster than I thought it would be considering the large crowd of people standing outside of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the chef's eggs Benedict which I was really excited about from the reviews, but sadly it just fell short. END
BEGIN NOW  The eggs itself were cooked perfectly and the side potatoes were well seasoned and quite tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Aside from that everything else was quite disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  The sausage wasn't very tasty and the sauce was too overpowering and made the toasted English muffin soggy and hard to cut through. END
BEGIN NOW  Though I was starving coming in I barely could finish half the meal. END
BEGIN NOW Taking a bite of the cob salad, I wish I would have gotten that because the crispy bacon and the fresh lettuce mixed with the well seasoned chicken (which was a hair dry) was worlds better than what I had. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, aside from the great customer service this place was just meh and I probably would check out another breakfast place next time. END
BEGIN NOW GREAT BRUNCH SPOT! Generous portions, and their potato hash is bomb! It has a subtle spiciness to it. END
BEGIN NOW  The side of potatoes comes with your entree, or it's 3. END
BEGIN NOW 99$ as a side. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict, which was on their special. END
BEGIN NOW  It had heaping servings of crab, a great creamy hollandaise sauce on top and a great portion of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  For 1. END
BEGIN NOW 99$, you can substitute your toast with a pancake. END
BEGIN NOW We also ordered the turkey/avocado/bacon Benedict, also on their special. END
BEGIN NOW  The combo was amazing and the poached egg was nice & drippy when I poked into it. END
BEGIN NOW Great spot, service was friendly & atmosphere was inviting. END
BEGIN NOW  Will definitely come back !. END
BEGIN NOW Jack London Square was fairly empty on Monday around 11:30 am. END
BEGIN NOW  Assuming that it was a weekday and no one around, we thought the Oakland Grill wouldn't have much people. END
BEGIN NOW  But I guess everyone that didn't have work also decided to go to Oakland grill. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty packed, we came in and snagged the last table. END
BEGIN NOW CRAB CAKE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW 99. END
BEGIN NOW SUPER FRIED. END
BEGIN NOW  but it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW  [Crab cake+Poached egg + hollandaise sauce+English muffin]. END
BEGIN NOW My friend preferred the blackstone Benedict, he said the crab and was too heavy and too fried for him. END
BEGIN NOW  All of the benedicts come with seasoned potatoes with a dollop of sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW  I Put the sour cream on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  Also comes with two small slices of fruit. END
BEGIN NOW BLACKSTONE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW 99. END
BEGIN NOW [bacon+tomato+hollandaise sauce+English muffin] totally preferred the crab cake. END
BEGIN NOW  The way they made the eggs though wasn't as runny as we all thought it would be. END
BEGIN NOW  This one was okay to me, but my friends loved this one way more. END
BEGIN NOW STRAWBERRY MIMOSA: $3. END
BEGIN NOW 99. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty small glass. END
BEGIN NOW  I totally thought it was strawberry + mimosa (OJ + Champagne) but it was actually strawberry + champagne. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Wish the flavor was more crispy C like a chilled glass or something. END
BEGIN NOW ORANGE JUICE: $4. END
BEGIN NOW 50. END
BEGIN NOW Freshly squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW  No pulp. END
BEGIN NOW  A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW  Small glass. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely a good find. END
BEGIN NOW  Would come again. END
BEGIN NOW  Has the ambience of a Denny's diner. END
BEGIN NOW  Also has an upstairs for dining. END
BEGIN NOW This was a cool little place my work group visited while out on a team building trip. END
BEGIN NOW  The location is in an area where there's a lot of wholesale produce traffic, so be forewarned that not only is parking bad, but be mindful of fast moving forklifts hauling produce. END
BEGIN NOW The restaurant has a lot of charm. END
BEGIN NOW  The kind of charm that says "established" and unpretentious. END
BEGIN NOW   My coworker set up the whole affair and had their staff arrange a large table for us. END
BEGIN NOW  While a few of my coworkers were late, they cheerfully filled our water glasses and coffee mugs without rushing us or giving us the impatient looks. END
BEGIN NOW  Granted it wasn't busy, but you all have been there. END
BEGIN NOW After having four cups of coffee, I had the applewood smoked sausage with eggs and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW  It was quite filling and I only finished about more than half. END
BEGIN NOW  In my opinion the apple sausage was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but was still pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a heaping portion of hash browns which was done right and not swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW Service was really good, they really took good care of us. END
BEGIN NOW I seriously doubt I'll venture here again as it's pretty far from where I live and parking is typical Oakland, but if someone invited me, I'd cheerfully meet them there. END
BEGIN NOW Lipstick stains on my coffee cup, potatoes didn't have the sour cream I asked for, an item that was not mine was added to my bill, and the poached egg on my benedict was fully cooked and didn't run at all! That's the whole point of the benedict! All of this and I couldn't even find my server to ask for these things to be fixed until my date was finished with their food. END
BEGIN NOW  Super bummer. END
BEGIN NOW  The only reason I gave a second star was that I've been here before and had a better experience. END
BEGIN NOW  This was pretty disappointing though. END
BEGIN NOW Oakland Grill will definitely satisfy your breakfast needs for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Located in downtown Oakland, it serves breakfast all day for those late risers. END
BEGIN NOW I went with the Lox Benedict (smoked salmon) with a side of potatoes and a few strawberry mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW   It was tasty, hearty, and the portion was huge. END
BEGIN NOW  The mimosas was mostly champagne, so don't worry about being skimped. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The only downside is my smoked salmon was topped with warm hollandaise sauce that lightly cooked the salmon (I like mine raw). END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe I should've ordered it on the side next time. END
BEGIN NOW Go with the Benedict, they're most popular dish. END
BEGIN NOW Oakland Grill is my solution to my Jersey diner. END
BEGIN NOW * They serve their menu all day (yes, breakfast anytime), they're pretty much always busy on the weekends, the food is hearty and reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW I've been both for weekday lunch and a Sunday brunch and both did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW  Lunch was much calmer; we walked right in like we owned the place. END
BEGIN NOW  My chicken and black beans was so large, I failed to clean my plate. END
BEGIN NOW  It was also healthy (yay!), filled with grilled chicken, black beans, fresh salsa, corn tortillas, a side salad and what seemed to be a half avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  It's so nice to be able to order fresh food at a casual eatery like this. END
BEGIN NOW This past weekend's meal wasn't quite so healthy. END
BEGIN NOW  I indulged in the veggie benedict with hollandaise on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  Not the most adventurous order, but definitely a solid one! The perfectly poached eggs topped on an english muffin with grilled tomatoes and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  My one complaint? I think they could step it up on their english muffin game. END
BEGIN NOW  Change it up maybe? Higher quality muffins? Still wonderful, but it could have used a lil' something. END
BEGIN NOW Most breakfasts come with what seems to be a pound of breakfast potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  Although the b'fast potatoes are solid, I prefer mine extra crispy (which I'll request for next time), as these were a bit more mushy. END
BEGIN NOW  The fresh fruit slices are such a great touch and this fruit was perfectly ripe!. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee is dece, nothing gourmet and I spied a strawberry mimosa that was going like hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is on point with water glasses always filled and quick service. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, a solid neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure if I'd wait an hour to grub, but definitely worth a 20 minute wait as the direct 'hood can be a bit sparse for brunching options, especially on a Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW * There are more diners per capita in Jersey than anywhere else in the world! Boo ya! #Themoreyouknow. END
BEGIN NOW Decent neighborhood establishment with all the usual items you'd expect for brunch, whether omelets, scrambles, benedicts, and other egg-heavy dishes; or lunch, such as salads, sandwiches, and burgers. END
BEGIN NOW  Anything you can get here is going to be pretty dependable and well-portioned for the price. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is reasonably friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, a perfectly decent experience that might not pack a lot of "wow" punches but is nevertheless dependable. END
BEGIN NOW Stopped in here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and it was pretty packed but they seated us within 5 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the eggs vocal stone which was like an eggs Benedict but with bacon and tomatoes instead of Canadian bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  The hollandaise sauce was amazing and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  My fiancé also had a pancake which was super fluffy and the portions were great. END
BEGIN NOW  Would definitely eat here again. END
BEGIN NOW One of my favorite brunch spots! Especially since they serve breakfast ALL DAY!. END
BEGIN NOW Its usually busy but you get seat right away almost all the time! Once you walk in, always get greeted by someone who's working. END
BEGIN NOW I usually order the Eggs Benedict and you always get a choice to have fruits or potatoes on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  They always have the freshest fruits available and if you have a specific fruit you only want, they will be happy to accommodate you. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried the potatoes too and they were equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW The server always comes  by to fill your water cup without you having to ask. END
BEGIN NOW  They constantly come by to check up on your table. END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone is always extremely friendly. END
BEGIN NOW My favourite brunch spot in Oakland hands down. END
BEGIN NOW  Recommended by my grandma who would frequently come here during her conferences back in the day and whose advice I take to heart. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a creature of habit so I always order the crab cake Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW loved it the first time and every time since. END
BEGIN NOW  Their food is Always bomb and just made with lots love. END
BEGIN NOW The spot is hidden, near a produce area, lots of parking outside. END
BEGIN NOW  It has 2 levels, downstairs with booths or upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW  Excellent cooks behind those grills, and friendly servers. END
BEGIN NOW  A must whilst in Oakland!!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is in such a hidden area (near all the meat packaging/wholesale warehouses). END
BEGIN NOW  I love it regardless though!. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW I got one of the Benedict and can't remember which one but I've never been a fan of crab cake or ham so I asked if I could replace it with a sausage patty and they were able to accommodate me! The one thing I look forward to in eating eggs benedict is the yolk that comes out of it, and for both my visits the yolk came gushing out, YES!. END
BEGIN NOW SERVICE:. END
BEGIN NOW The servers have always been super nice. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never had a bad encounter with any of them. END
BEGIN NOW  Super friendly, and I'm glad they're able to substitute. END
BEGIN NOW PARKING:. END
BEGIN NOW Parking is on the street, & it is meter parking, unless you park like 2 blocks away for 2 hour free parking. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious eggs benedict and $3 mimosas? Yes please!. END
BEGIN NOW Arrived here for the usual Sunday brunch ritual after getting frustrated and not finding any bottomless mimosa spots that served past 2 pm. END
BEGIN NOW  We settled for this spot when we noticed how nicely priced their mimosas were. END
BEGIN NOW  It was of course incredibly busy since it was Sunday brunch hours and but we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was incredibly kind and it being our first time was very information and willingly gave us her recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW My friend went with the burger and I opted for the eggs benedict after eyeing it up at our neighbor's table. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sure the crab benedict is the more popular option, but oddly enough I'm not the biggest fan of crab. END
BEGIN NOW  Two rounds of mimosas in and our food arrived. END
BEGIN NOW  It looked AMAZING first off, and the taste matched its appearances. END
BEGIN NOW  The eggs were basically orgasmic. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfectly cooked and explosive with all that delicious yolk. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes that came on the side were freaking delicious as well! So packed full of different type of herbs, flavors, and you can tell that the cooks had scraped all of the good stuff off of the pan (hey, that's where all the flavor is, right?) to garnish the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  I was in heaven, and so incredibly happy by the time the meal was done. END
BEGIN NOW I do wish they had bottomless mimosas and chicken and waffles, but those are just my own selfish desires. END
BEGIN NOW  Other than that, I will certainly return!. END
BEGIN NOW Great everything!  Seriously. END
BEGIN NOW   I had never tried Red Bay Coffee before this- two thumbs up!  Plus it's roasted in Oakland- I love that!. END
BEGIN NOW I first tried the oatmeal and went for sweet- adding bananas, brown sugar and yogurt. END
BEGIN NOW   Delicious!  However, the polenta- oh the polenta!  I get it with caramelized red onions, fresh green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and sea salt. END
BEGIN NOW   Filling, nutritious and absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW It was all so good that I had to go back and try their donut happy hour- HOLY COW!!. END
BEGIN NOW Top that all off with a fantastic mission- " job creation and leadership training for girls in Oakland who face significant barriers to employment," this is definitely a favorite spot now. END
BEGIN NOW   I highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW Mamacitas Cafe is small, just a serving counter on the left. END
BEGIN NOW  and some lounge seats to the right. END
BEGIN NOW another room has tables for laptopers. END
BEGIN NOW  not sure if it's connected to the Cafe or not. END
BEGIN NOW eats: oats or polenta(grits)  choose polenta (12 oz 6. END
BEGIN NOW 95). END
BEGIN NOW brew: red bay coffee (3). END
BEGIN NOW drips:. END
BEGIN NOW In a world overrun with Starbucks, Peet's and Keurig machines that you have to decalcify every 2 minutes (you don't know my struggle so you don't feel my hustle!), a good cup of coffee has become a luxury that too many of us don't get too experience often enough. END
BEGIN NOW  But look no further! Sip on without the shame of knowing your joe was sourced by underpaid laborers and upheld by unfair labor practices! Dunk a delicious donut hole in that cup and know that pastry was made with wholehearted love and passion by women who support fair business practices and use their small business to uplift their community!. END
BEGIN NOW I love everything about Mamacita's, and please believe that the coffee, lavender lemonade and yummy donut kebabs are just the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW  The owners, Shana and Renee, grind super hard for theirs and employ and educate young women in high school on the ins and outs of business ownership along the way by offering opportunities to keep kids occupied and focused. END
BEGIN NOW  They serve up Red Bay Coffee, keeping it fresh, local and delicious while giving back to the hood whenever they can. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't praise them enough!. END
BEGIN NOW My fiancée and I first heard word of Mamacitas Café in the East Bay Express over the summer and appreciated their mission. END
BEGIN NOW  Then when looking for a vendor for our post-wedding picnic they came immediately to mind. END
BEGIN NOW  It was easy as pie to get in touch with them and then for a very fair price they served a lovely selection of their amazing donut kebabs to our assembled guests. END
BEGIN NOW They were there on time, supplied all the gear they needed, and ran a well organized operation. END
BEGIN NOW Both the sweet and savory options were a big hit, along with the hot coffee, iced coffee, iced tea, and lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a dessert or coffee vendor. END
BEGIN NOW I sat with a group of 4. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything was tasty and the service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  They were more than accommodating for our 8 month son. END
BEGIN NOW We shared a chicken and waffle, which was very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  The waffle reminds me of a doughnut and the chicken has a perfectly crispy battery. END
BEGIN NOW I had the vegetable hash and everything was cooked just right: nothing soggy or greasy. END
BEGIN NOW  The red chile sauce was a great compliment to the greens. END
BEGIN NOW Long wait. END
BEGIN NOW   That's to be expected though. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee was good. END
BEGIN NOW I had the waffle with fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   The waffle was better than average but the chicken wasn't great. END
BEGIN NOW   They use chicken breast, which is indisputably the worst cut of meat on the bird. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a tasteless, fat-less cut. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a reason fried chicken joints serve legs and wings. END
BEGIN NOW This is a mixed review regarding the food and the atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   Had the Thursday before Memorial Day off and the choice of Oakland eateries were Mama's  Royal Cafe (a standard on any day of hookie) and Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW   So I choose to pay Auntie a visit. END
BEGIN NOW Service: On point, coffee DELICIOUS!!!  Whatever the jam was. END
BEGIN NOW YAASS!!!. END
BEGIN NOW The not so great. END
BEGIN NOW  The noise level in this place is deafening. END
BEGIN NOW   It was about 11 am and not crowed, but steady. END
BEGIN NOW   Restaurants of today have zero noise cancellation and given the open space, closeness of the kitchen and lots of wood decor the sound is to the point of painful. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the Corned Beef Hash with Poached Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   I know my corned beef and this was a miss. END
BEGIN NOW   Very little meat and a whole lot of deconstructed cabbage and peppers. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing was together. END
BEGIN NOW   It was like a tiny bit of meat topped with cabbage, onions, some potatoes and the topped with the eggs that were not poached well (running whites). END
BEGIN NOW   Homemade rye bread was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW My last put off was this little note card that explained about the "surcharge". END
BEGIN NOW   Auntie charges a 15% surcharge to help pay for the entire staff. END
BEGIN NOW   You may also leave and additional amount that will go directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW   And like a good Aunt, she has broken down what the extra 3% or 5% for your server would be. END
BEGIN NOW   You read this coming into the restaurant, you read it again at the table and on your tab. END
BEGIN NOW The cost of doing business is just that. END
BEGIN NOW   Whatever you have to pay to keep your place staffed well should be built into the cost of your meals, not let the patron work on supplementing your payroll. END
BEGIN NOW   What will we see next?  PG&E goes up on gas so there is another surcharge to read about if we want hot food or to see the food on the table?. END
BEGIN NOW So, I will not return to Aunt Mary's, and I will instead go visit Mama's. END
BEGIN NOW like everyone should. END
BEGIN NOW We went here with an open mind, but was disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  Food and service were WAY below average. END
BEGIN NOW  And what's up with this 15% mandatory tip? I don't buy this argument that since kitchen staff are making min wage then charge customers more to help the kitchen staff. END
BEGIN NOW  Really? If the owner really cares for his employees, why pay them min wage? Give them a raise man. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't ask customers to compensate for your lack of humanity. END
BEGIN NOW  Total BS. END
BEGIN NOW  We will never go back here and will not recommend it to anyone. END
BEGIN NOW Now here are just 2 examples of the shortfalls regarding the food:. END
BEGIN NOW (1) $15 for 2 hard pancakes with fake cherry jam. END
BEGIN NOW  Really? For the sake of comparison: Bette's diner has the BEST pancakes; price for 2 is $6. END
BEGIN NOW 75 (same size). END
BEGIN NOW  It comes with butter and syrup (and not attitude). END
BEGIN NOW  Who would pay twice as much money for lower quality food/service?. END
BEGIN NOW (2) my poached eggs where raw yuk. END
BEGIN NOW  It's not very hard to make poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  Believe me, just Google it and you'll learn. END
BEGIN NOW I think people who give this place 5 starts should really get out more often. END
BEGIN NOW  Try other breakfast places. END
BEGIN NOW  Any place is better than this (Yes even Denny's). END
BEGIN NOW  The entire experience was way below average. END
BEGIN NOW  The only bright side was my lovely company. END
BEGIN NOW I've had Aunt Mary's bookmarked for sooo long it moved to a new location hahah! (Not far. END
BEGIN NOW only a few blocks down!). END
BEGIN NOW After my experience, I can see why so many people rave about it. END
BEGIN NOW  It's super casual with generous portions. END
BEGIN NOW  Prices are not cheap here, but you are paying for good quality dishes. END
BEGIN NOW  (Kid friendly too - there's toys and books in the waiting area). END
BEGIN NOW Our party of 7 didn't have to wait long early on a Saturday morning (around 9am). END
BEGIN NOW  I put my name down at the front & was told they have a special room upstairs for large parties. END
BEGIN NOW  (I believe your party has to be complete before they will seat you though) We felt like VIPs since we had the whole space to ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW  There was even a bathroom upstairs and couches! KUDOS to our wonderful server to made the endless treks up and down the stairs bringing our food, clearing our plates, refilling our coffee, and checking on us periodically. END
BEGIN NOW I really liked my Southern Bubble and Squeak dish (what a cool name :D) It's basically like gravy, eggs, and mashed potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW simple enough but it was really tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Another memorable dish in the party was Huevos Benedictos but it was way spicer than it looked. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, I was really impressed with the side of pancake ($1. END
BEGIN NOW 75) that came with the Basic Eggs & 2 Sides - so gigantic!. END
BEGIN NOW They were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives but unfortunately I didn't get to try the Pain Perdue this particular visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Yelp pics look amazing though - can't wait to go back for brunch again to try it!! (Only served during weekend brunch). END
BEGIN NOW This is definitely a neighborhood gem and worth a visit if you are in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW Tips: Large parties of 8 or more can call to make reservations before 9am. END
BEGIN NOW  15% auto tip charge on all bills. END
BEGIN NOW  No dinner service. END
BEGIN NOW  No TOGO orders on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW You know when you walk into a place and it just reminds you of a little piece of your past? That happened for me at Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't pinpoint what, but walking in on a later afternoon weekday, to a spacious and airy place, a kind hello and people thoroughly enjoying their food, I knew I was in for a treat. END
BEGIN NOW  A little bit country, a little bit Oakland, this diner is serving up comfort food all day, every day. END
BEGIN NOW  No dinner service here, but they make up for it by offering breakfast until their 3pm closing. END
BEGIN NOW I can see this place being a shit show on weekend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Be patient. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're like me and can enjoy a leisurely weekday meal, as always I suggest that. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the chilaquiles asking for the two accompanying eggs poached and an iced tea and got to using their free wifi. END
BEGIN NOW The iced tea was a bucket. END
BEGIN NOW  Straight up the largest mason jar filled with unsweetened iced tea. END
BEGIN NOW  No need for refills, since I mean, there is so much dang liquid. END
BEGIN NOW  Smart. END
BEGIN NOW The chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  Not like the one from your local taqueria. END
BEGIN NOW  Lacking in elbow grease from an abuela, they were still a treat for the senses. END
BEGIN NOW  The fried tortilla chips perfectly soft, yet still had a hint of crisp served a pretty perfect bed for the eggs, pico, black beans and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  The side tortillas were even a bit of an overkill. END
BEGIN NOW  The hint of heat from the verde salsa really rounded up this dish. END
BEGIN NOW I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW  15% gratuity is included and divided amongst all staff and you can choose to give more which goes directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm ok with that. END
BEGIN NOW  My one small gripe? This isn't a cheap endeavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Lunch was around $18, not the cheapest meal you've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be back mainly to try more on the menu, especially the hangtown fry-tatta: a frittata with bacon and spinach, topped with fried oysters and fennel slices, drizzled with Rockefeller sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Yep. END
BEGIN NOW  That's the truth right there. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back, for sure. END
BEGIN NOW Their BLT is the best sandwich I have ever eaten, and I am not a sandwich person. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the XL bacon strips and spicy aioli generously spread in between the toasty, buttered sandwich bread with crunchy, fresh lettuce that will make you return for this. END
BEGIN NOW Served with a fresh, green salad NOT overdressed with vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW The other must-try is their oyster po-boy. END
BEGIN NOW  It's fried to crispy deliciousness. END
BEGIN NOW  I love their refillable iced tea and my husband loves their lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW Extremely family friendly - They have high chairs and mommas often come here so you're likely to see a breastfeeding mom or two who'll understand if your kiddo has a meltdown. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure if the bathroom has a changing room. END
BEGIN NOW Call ahead for pick-up if you'd like. END
BEGIN NOW  Tips are automatically included and split among front and back of house staff. END
BEGIN NOW I love this place, I'll be back, and if there's anything bad to be said - it's that the food's so good, it's a popular spot so expect to wait a little to eat, but be rest assured that your taste buds will be excited and you'll remember your meal and be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW I really like the food here. END
BEGIN NOW  The oyster po'boy is especially good. END
BEGIN NOW  Stopped going due to this 15% surcharge business. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't want to feel pressured to leave a tip on top of a forced tip -- which is really what it is, regardless of what they choose to call it. END
BEGIN NOW  Check out the card I found on the table the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW  (Sorry, but Yelp does not have a "rotate" function!). END
BEGIN NOW I have always been a good tipper, and very forgiving of problems that are out of the server's control, so it's not the amount that turns me off, rather the principle. END
BEGIN NOW Sad, because the food is good, though it is a little high, and perhaps that's why they couldn't just up the food prices rather than institute the surcharge. END
BEGIN NOW I'm always exploring breakfast and brunch places in Oakland and, given the reviews I had read, I was highly anticipating a great breakfast/brunch here. END
BEGIN NOW  While everything started great, it was just went downhill from there and I walked out very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW First, the good stuff: It was very busy, but I was still promptly greeted by hostess who handed me the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW  When she saw I was jus one person, she offered me a seat at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW  Once there, I was promptly attended to by a smiling and friendly server, Sasha, who took coffee order and was patient with me while I decided what I wanted for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  My meal, the huevos benedictos, was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  The sauce, not hollandaise, was very spicy, which is great with me! Up until the time Sasha checked on how I liked my meal, she was five stars all the way. END
BEGIN NOW What went wrong?. END
BEGIN NOW A few minutes after I was seated, a second hostess came up to me and said that there was a waiting list, implying that I "cut" in front of everybody on the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW  I told her I tried to get on the list, but another hostess offered me the counter. END
BEGIN NOW  She wanted to know who that was and then she walked away and never said another word to me. END
BEGIN NOW  She was very polite and professional, but I found the encounter offensive, partly because she never apologized. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, she should have checked with the other hostesses before confronting with me. END
BEGIN NOW The other issues were minor. END
BEGIN NOW  My server never offered to refill my coffee, I had to ask twice. END
BEGIN NOW  She dropped off my bill with a polite comment and was gone before I could say anything to her - without ever asking me if I wanted anything else, which I did. END
BEGIN NOW Service is as important to me as the food and this was a bad experience, primarily because of the second hostess, not the server. END
BEGIN NOW  Because the food was good, I may try it again someday. END
BEGIN NOW Came here for brunch once with my sister, dad and niece. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone seemed to like their food, including my picky 3-year-old niece. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Grilled Flank Steak Sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW  The flavors were great, but my meat was so tough!!!!! It was so awkward to eat because I couldn't rip off a piece and all of it would just come flying out of the bread. END
BEGIN NOW  If the steak wasn't so hard, this sandwich would've been amazing and would've changed how many stars I'm giving this place. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried my sister's catfish sandwich and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Should have gotten that. END
BEGIN NOW They have an interesting and unique menu which makes me want to come back and try some more. END
BEGIN NOW After receiving a recommendation of this spot from a co worker, we decided to check it out as we were still looking out for a signature breakfast spot in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW   We came here for Sunday brunch and found ourselves only waiting for about  15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW   We ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW Lemon ricotta cornmeal pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW Side of spicy pork sausage. END
BEGIN NOW Pain perdu. END
BEGIN NOW Sadly, everything was no more than mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW   The sauce that was served with the pancakes was crazy overpowering. END
BEGIN NOW   It would have been better served without. END
BEGIN NOW   The pancakes, alone, tasted great. END
BEGIN NOW The homemade sausage, while I appreciated it, was overcooked and dry. END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey pain perdu fell short. END
BEGIN NOW   After a bite or two, I was over it. END
BEGIN NOW   It looked better than it tasted. END
BEGIN NOW Service also fell short. END
BEGIN NOW   It was difficult to find someone to ask for our check or get a refill on water and coffee. END
BEGIN NOW   3 stars at most. END
BEGIN NOW I have to say im only judging off my food experience here. END
BEGIN NOW  I was with a table of 5 and everyone agreed my food was definitely the worst. END
BEGIN NOW  So. END
BEGIN NOW The bisquits and gravy taste more like bisquit and paste. END
BEGIN NOW  A paste that gives a hint of glue. END
BEGIN NOW No salt added whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW  I mean NONE. END
BEGIN NOW  Possibly the blandest biscuit and gravy I've ever witnessed. END
BEGIN NOW  So much for being whisked away to my childhood. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  No. END
BEGIN NOW $15 for that atrocity. END
BEGIN NOW I tasted the waffle of my friends. END
BEGIN NOW  On point. END
BEGIN NOW  Chicken was good too. END
BEGIN NOW The fried oysters-doable. END
BEGIN NOW Minus 1 star for having a menu that actually says  "maple flavored syrup" or actual "maple syrup" for $3. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW no. END
BEGIN NOW  Just serve maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW The service was just ok too. END
BEGIN NOW  I mean I probably wouldnt go back but it's worth a try if your in the area. END
BEGIN NOW Aunt Mary's is a solid place for breakfast and brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Although their specialty items are a little more expensive, they're pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   I enjoyed the posole verde. END
BEGIN NOW   Good pancakes too. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't like the chicken fried steak too much, I thought the meat was a little rubbery, but the chile sauce on top was good. END
BEGIN NOW   Ingredients are fresh and portions are generous. END
BEGIN NOW Amazing food and service. END
BEGIN NOW    I saw this place on Diners and Dives and was sold when they showed how to make Shrimp and Grits. END
BEGIN NOW    After visiting our daughter on Mothers day weekend, we got up early to avoid the breakfast rush. END
BEGIN NOW   They opened at 8:00. END
BEGIN NOW   We were greeted and asked to sit where we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW   This area and restaurant setting reminded us of Portland, Oregon. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved it. END
BEGIN NOW   I of course had to try the Shrimp and Grits, which was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   We watched other food pass by and everything looked amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   You must try Aunt Mary's!. END
BEGIN NOW I have many happy memories of this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Great appetizers and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   They have $1 oysters for happy hour and they are always fresh and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  They serve a lot of cool condiments with them that are fun to try and are taste tantalizing. END
BEGIN NOW  If you never had raw oysters before, this is a good place to try it first, because they are small and mild. END
BEGIN NOW  I also highly recommend their deviled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  I am not crazy about their chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW that is one dish I would not recommend. END
BEGIN NOW They have a large selection of wines and the waiters really know what their stuff in case you need help choosing the right drink for your mood. END
BEGIN NOW  No matter how busy they get I've never had an issue with the wait staff and we always were able to get a seat somehow, though we usually get there early. END
BEGIN NOW Where do I start? I had a detailed review in my head but then realized it was long and would have been a rant, so I will just give pluses and minuses and be brief. END
BEGIN NOW Started out as a nice warm Oakland evening at the beginning of a three day weekend and looking forward to relaxing with great food and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks, yes, they were great: sidecar and petit pomme. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice wine list too. END
BEGIN NOW Started with the roasted cauliflower and baby kale to share. END
BEGIN NOW  The cauliflower was not cooked, and the dish was barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW  Server said it was not intended to be hot. END
BEGIN NOW  We took two bites of raw cauliflower, and she took it away-not going to eat raw cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW  The sauce was rather bland as well. END
BEGIN NOW  Very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW Next came our steak and sliders. END
BEGIN NOW  The sliders they got right although the buns were a little dry. END
BEGIN NOW  I could easily overlook this. END
BEGIN NOW  The steak was cooked just right, and the sauce was good, but again the dish came to us barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW  Is this a new thing I just don't know about?  I like my food served hot from pan or grill to plate to table. END
BEGIN NOW Our fries to share never came; we had to ask for them. END
BEGIN NOW  When they did arrive, they were great-perfectly cooked and seasoned, temp was just right, and aioli was better than most. END
BEGIN NOW  Still disappointing since we had already finished our mains. END
BEGIN NOW  Would have been nice to enjoy both at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh well. END
BEGIN NOW Service was aloof and uneven. END
BEGIN NOW  They had a crowd but not too busy so there was no reason for delayed service. END
BEGIN NOW  If the kitchen is having timing issues, the server just didn't seem concerned. END
BEGIN NOW  I felt like we just had to take what we got with no apologies, just drop the plate at the table and run. END
BEGIN NOW  There are some nice sounding dishes on the menu I would like to try, but I don't think that will happen any time soon. END
BEGIN NOW This is not my place; I will not return. END
BEGIN NOW Pesto pizza, chicken wings, ceviche, wine tasting, cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  My ladies and I had a great night there sharing dinner and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Busy lively atmosphere for late 20-30-40 somethings. END
BEGIN NOW I would definitely recommend to others and go back for Friday night happenings. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was great and service was great!. END
BEGIN NOW Whooooooaaaa there Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  How have I NOT written a review for one of my favorite happy hours in the East Bay? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  I genuinely love their happy hour offerings and the food for that is also delish. END
BEGIN NOW  De. END
BEGIN NOW  Lish. END
BEGIN NOW  Umph. END
BEGIN NOW I actually discovered District's amazing happy hour on a pub crawl. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes. END
BEGIN NOW  That have happy hour on Saturdays. END
BEGIN NOW  You're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW  So once you've had brunch, with bottomless mimosas, started to sober up, and don't want to. END
BEGIN NOW come here. END
BEGIN NOW The tables fill up mostly due to reservations. END
BEGIN NOW  #protip. END
BEGIN NOW But, if you can find yourself at the bar, then go for it. END
BEGIN NOW  Minus a star because the service can be (okay, probably will be) slow. END
BEGIN NOW  But, no one is perfect right?. END
BEGIN NOW The menu includes $6 house wine, beers, well drinks, and my favorite the food (see photo for menu). END
BEGIN NOW  $6 for 6 oysters, yes. END
BEGIN NOW  Recommendation: go with the truffle fries. END
BEGIN NOW  They are cooked to order so they are not cold. END
BEGIN NOW  They come seasoned with salt, pepper, and what I believe is Rosemary (listed as herbs and truffle Parmesan aioli), ketchup, and the dipping sauce aforementioned. END
BEGIN NOW It's walkable from 12th street BART and then you can explore old Oakland, head to Jack London Square, or off to the Fox Theatre and Uptown. END
BEGIN NOW  I love it here and definitely recommend it for a stop along the way or a place for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW District isn't a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a wine bar with food. END
BEGIN NOW   We failed to know this. END
BEGIN NOW Their menu consists of small plates and pizzas. END
BEGIN NOW   The bf and I ordered six dishes and that was too much. END
BEGIN NOW   Stick to about two dishes per person and you should be good. END
BEGIN NOW   If not, order as you go. END
BEGIN NOW MUST TRY:. END
BEGIN NOW The two standout dishes of the night were the tempura avocado and the sliced hanger steak. END
BEGIN NOW   The tempura avocado had a light and crispy exterior, topped with chili lime salt (which was phenomenal), and served with a roasted jalapeno aioli sauce for dipping. END
BEGIN NOW   The hanger steak was so tender that it melts in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW   The topping was that it was served with chimichurri sauce. END
BEGIN NOW OTHER FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW *The raw oysters were medium size and served with a mignonette sauce and fresh horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW   They do have $1 oysters (opposed to $2. END
BEGIN NOW 50 each) during happy hour (weekdays 4-6pm). END
BEGIN NOW *The steak tartare was okay. END
BEGIN NOW   The bf wasn't a big fan as it was tangier than other places. END
BEGIN NOW   One of the biggest mistakes with the dish was the egg. END
BEGIN NOW   Unlike most places that serve it with a raw egg on top, District's version cooks their egg. END
BEGIN NOW   My egg was more cooked than in pictures I've seen on Yelp and lacked that yolky gooiness. END
BEGIN NOW *The margherita pizza had a nice thin crust and was perfect for sharing. END
BEGIN NOW   It was topped with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good but it needed more tomatoes or tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Service was nice but staff was often missing so it took a long time getting what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW   There was a bit of a timing issue with food arrival. END
BEGIN NOW   The pace in the beginning was good as we had food in front of us but not to the point of taking up all table room). END
BEGIN NOW   There was so much time between the last couple dishes that food had settled and we were too full. END
BEGIN NOW Depending on the size of your party, make a reservation on Opentable. END
BEGIN NOW   If reservations aren't made, seating is free for all which we lucked out with. END
BEGIN NOW   District has a limited number of reservations because there is a limited amount of seating. END
BEGIN NOW   Though it's a big place, most of the area is taken for bar seating and lounge areas. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT TO KNOW:. END
BEGIN NOW *Full bar. END
BEGIN NOW *Take advantage of their happy hour specials from 4-6pm. END
BEGIN NOW *Street parking or a paid lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW My friend and I went to district to watch the warriors game last night and had a horrifying experience. END
BEGIN NOW  I asked the bartender to place a order for food and drinks, he rolled his eyes and said I'm kinda busy ( tall large white male). END
BEGIN NOW My friend who I was with (white) went outside after the game as we waited on the bill to take a call from a Ill family member. END
BEGIN NOW  I went outside to let her know that the bill was ready. END
BEGIN NOW  The manager John ran outside in full stride after me and yelled in front of everybody outside you are banned you are banned for skipping out on your bill. END
BEGIN NOW  I explained to him I was getting her to come pay her portion but he continued to yell that I was banned. END
BEGIN NOW  We gave him our cards and proceeded to walk behind him. END
BEGIN NOW  He told the security not to let me in while he charged our cards. END
BEGIN NOW  When he returned he threw bill holder at my friend with our cards in it which fell on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW  As we checked the bill he charged us double and refused to let us back in to discuss it. END
BEGIN NOW  I have never been so disrespected at an establishment in all my life. END
BEGIN NOW One of those rare places that does a number of things well, whether it's serving up weekend brunch, offering daily drinks and dinner, or morphing into a thumpin' hangout on late weekend nights. END
BEGIN NOW No matter what the environment is, the ambience is friendly, casual, diverse, and welcoming in a uniquely Oakland way. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunches here, in particular, are a laid-back way of easing into your weekend day, and there's a wide array of scrumptious offerings to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems like half of Oakland is here too, all with smiling faces. END
BEGIN NOW Can't go wrong with this place no matter the purpose. END
BEGIN NOW  Highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW My friend wanted to try this place and I was down to because they had $1 oysters. END
BEGIN NOW   When I entered, I stood their awkwardly trying to find a waiter to seat me. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't know that you actually seat yourself. END
BEGIN NOW  (Remember this! So you don't awkwardly stand there and wait for someone to come). END
BEGIN NOW  Once we sat down, it took them awhile to come to the table. END
BEGIN NOW  The service here is extremely slow. END
BEGIN NOW  The food service is fine. END
BEGIN NOW  But grabbing the waiter's attention is extremely difficult. END
BEGIN NOW I tried the following:. END
BEGIN NOW Peach Bellini: it was good! But not much for $6. END
BEGIN NOW  I finished it quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  So ordered the next drink. END
BEGIN NOW Grapefruit beer: it was delicious! I wanted to order another one but I was kind of full. END
BEGIN NOW Oysters: they were good. END
BEGIN NOW  They waiter asked if we wanted Tabasco and I said yes but they never brought it out. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken wings: there were 5 wings and they were a lot smaller than I expected. END
BEGIN NOW  It came out on a cute little cast iron skillet. END
BEGIN NOW  The wings were good but I didn't like the sauce it came with. END
BEGIN NOW I would return for the food but only if I have a lot of time because of their service. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking in that area isn't difficult either so that's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW It's really more of a 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars since it was slightly  over average. END
BEGIN NOW   We came here for appetizers on a Saturday night and it had a pretty good vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Great mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW We started with the deviled eggs to wet our appetites. END
BEGIN NOW   Creamy egg with a hint heat from the sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW   Next was the Brussel sprouts which were roasted and blended well with the cider brown butter and almonds. END
BEGIN NOW   We had them hold the pancetta since we were vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW   Last we had the fontina and spinach arancini which was on a bed of spicy tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   All very good. END
BEGIN NOW I think we will go back and try it for dinner next time. END
BEGIN NOW I've been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW  The first time was lovely, but the second time (last night) was ruined by the female Africa American late 20s, maybe 30ish, bright pink lipstick server who seemed so annoyed by having to get us a couple of drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  All simple questions were answered with a perplexing huffiness. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't think we did anything to set her off, but it was like she hated us the minute we walked in, and there's no place for that in this business. END
BEGIN NOW  Or this world really. END
BEGIN NOW The bartenders were great, and though we had a table we just started going to them directly to avoid her odd wrath. END
BEGIN NOW Another plus - gorgeous art!. END
BEGIN NOW This place was great!. END
BEGIN NOW Le bf, me, and one of our good couple friends stumbled in here after first getting some beers at The Trappist and some nomz at the Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW  My bf was on the hunt for some oysters and he saw a sign advertising them here! Sold. END
BEGIN NOW The sign advertised $1 oysters at happy hour which we missed (darnit!), but their normal price was $2. END
BEGIN NOW 75. END
BEGIN NOW  My bf and his friend ended up splitting a plate of about 10 oysters with a few beers between them while I got a glass of champagne and split the bread pudding with le other gf. END
BEGIN NOW The food was great! I'm not a huge fan of oysters in general but these were fresh and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread pudding wasn't the best I've ever had but was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Was kind of pricey but was also kind of a "scene" type place. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, we really enjoyed posting up and having a few drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW  I would definitely come back here and try more of the food! I think at happy hour (with happy hour prices), this would be a great spot I would actively seek out. END
BEGIN NOW During my first year of working in Oakland, I would, on average, about once a week, take a lunchtime walk from our office at City Center to Jack London Square, usually approaching via Chinatown and Webster Street while returning via Old Town and Washington Street. END
BEGIN NOW  In the latter area, I've been to Pacific Coast Brewing Company a couple of times, I've glanced at the used bookstore, and have made frequent passages through Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW  Also noticed have been a handful of somewhat trendy-looking bars, just awaiting for me to make an appearance. END
BEGIN NOW Finally, as it often happens, I wind up at a wonderful new location almost by accident. END
BEGIN NOW  A couple of weeks ago we were supposed to meet at another bar about a half block away. END
BEGIN NOW  For whatever reason, however, that location was not open when it said it would be. END
BEGIN NOW  Its loss and The District's gain. END
BEGIN NOW  Or, more precisely, our gain - we now have a reliable standby to go to after a day of putting up with the powers that be. END
BEGIN NOW  Comfy seats at right angles with room for small plates to share, the environment is just made for socializing - public but not too loud; active but with the ability to move around freely. END
BEGIN NOW  Plus the place has a good selection of brews, hard alcohol, and after work food - I recommend the shrimp pizza with chorizo, with a Raging Bitch to wash it down. END
BEGIN NOW  Even though it's not technically on the menu, our waitress complied with my request of an irish coffee, by improvising with Jamesons, and of course, coffee. END
BEGIN NOW So, a week later, one of the bigwigs at work decided that, for whoever wanted to take him up on the offer, we should do a pubcrawl through Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  It says volumes that this crawl began and ended at The District. END
BEGIN NOW District never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW  The food and libations are strictly top quality and the staff are very friendly for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW  The only thing on the menu that I've tried and felt "meh" about was the pesto mozzarella pizza. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty bland. END
BEGIN NOW I also had the chance to host my birthday festivities at District. END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone in my party was treated promptly and the servers made sure my night was special. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't even have to reserve a couch, I just showed up early with part of my group. END
BEGIN NOW  The space was a little small for my party (around 23 people) but we made it work and stayed out the way (or tried to). END
BEGIN NOW I booked a table at Bellanico's this week, looking for a restaurant that offered great, authentic Italian food, a great environment and a baby friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW   They delivered!. END
BEGIN NOW When we arrived they had a table for four adults and a high chair ready for us, a little offset from the rest of the dining room which was much appreciated. END
BEGIN NOW   Right off the bat, our waiter was courteous, knowledgeable and professional. END
BEGIN NOW   He was present when we needed him but not overbearing - just the right balance. END
BEGIN NOW   Most importantly, he was patient with our group taking some time to reach decisions as he was with a 2-year old walking around the table non-stop. END
BEGIN NOW Our food was outright excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   Cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned and immaculately presented. END
BEGIN NOW   The menu presents a wide array of choices to satisfy wide arrays of preferences, which we needed for our group. END
BEGIN NOW   There are many appetizers to choose from, of which many also cater well to being shared as a group. END
BEGIN NOW   In main courses, there are several pasta and non-pastas to choose from, and they all look delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW As a trained sommelier, I was happy to see that the diversity of the menu was reflected in the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW   It's mostly Italian, and reflects all of the major wine producing areas - not a generic list of 15 different Chiantis. END
BEGIN NOW   We chose the Aglianico del Vulture which was I was happy to find - I think it's the first time I've seen it at a restaurant in California. END
BEGIN NOW   The list also has wines from France and Spain. END
BEGIN NOW I've been looking for restaurant that has all of the above for sometime, and I am happy I found Bellanico's. END
BEGIN NOW   We will be visiting many more times. END
BEGIN NOW Just had a very awkward exchange with the lady behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not sure if it's the way I look or was dressed but every question I had was returned with a confused look. END
BEGIN NOW  Do you accept credit for gift certificates? I thought that was a valid question because some stores only allow debit or cash payment for gift cards. END
BEGIN NOW  Can I use your phone to call my brother to make sure the gift certificate is addressed right? Another perplexed look. END
BEGIN NOW  Then I was handed the receipt where there was a section for tip, I'll chalk this one up to how the system is set up but they may want to exclude a tip section for buying a gift card. END
BEGIN NOW I live up the street and if I was more impressed with this place, I would go more. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes, the food is really good. END
BEGIN NOW  Portions are very small. END
BEGIN NOW  If My girlfriend and I were to walk out of here with a drink and a full stomach, we wouldn't leave paying less than a $100 and that's probably without tip. END
BEGIN NOW We've had good service here before and the food is tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Three stars for that. END
BEGIN NOW  Minus two stars for the way I was treated this past time and the small portion size and no beer on tap (I get it, it's a wine place but have at least one beer, this is California). END
BEGIN NOW Been several times. END
BEGIN NOW  Always good. END
BEGIN NOW  Looked at menu at competitor down the street. END
BEGIN NOW  Big ass television for Warrior game. END
BEGIN NOW  No thank you. END
BEGIN NOW  That's what sports bars and living rooms are created to accommodate. END
BEGIN NOW  Italian meals are about good food, conversations, and no cell phones. END
BEGIN NOW  Went back to Bellancio-no reservation, but early for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  Seated promptly. END
BEGIN NOW  Fried green olives - more addicting than crack. END
BEGIN NOW  Had a Negroni and an Aperol spritz ( my wife) Great wine from Montalcatino. END
BEGIN NOW  Best pork chop ever! Service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Almost had a Tony Soprano moment. END
BEGIN NOW  Why do you hipsters and no etiquette knowing men wear your stupid baseball hats indoors and in a dinner house? My wife kept one of you from a good stare-down and punch out from a former Marine having dinner on Memorial Day. END
BEGIN NOW Restaurant Week Review!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW Bellanico has a phenomenal menu, and they have really chosen a tasting menu that shows off the diversity of the dishes they offer. END
BEGIN NOW  I *almost* came back for lunch today, but decided to try a different menu solely for the sake of variety. END
BEGIN NOW  The space is very warm and inviting; it reminded us of being in a small cafe in Europe. END
BEGIN NOW  The servers were really nice, and the owner spent time walking around and making sure everything was going o. END
BEGIN NOW k. END
BEGIN NOW  without being too obtrusive; he obviously cares a lot about his customers' experience. END
BEGIN NOW The menu started out with two small appetizers, both practically bite-size. END
BEGIN NOW  They were a nice start to the menu; they provided a small tasting and good flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Next followed the "primi" course; we chose "tombo tuna" and "braised lamb belly. END
BEGIN NOW " While probably the weakest course on the menu, the proteins in each of these dishes were still really good. END
BEGIN NOW  We were not super happy with the chickpeas in the tuna dish or the red mustard in the lamb belly, but aside from those two items, both dishes were still strong. END
BEGIN NOW The secondi dishes were very strong; we ordered the ono (turned out to be trout) and pork tenderloin. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork tenderloin was the star dish of the night; I would *HIGHLY* recommend ordering it. END
BEGIN NOW  The trout was also pretty good, although probably fishier than the ono would have been. END
BEGIN NOW For desert, you will get a sampling of deserts (unless you are here for lunch, in case you will have to choose). END
BEGIN NOW  The espresso panna cotta and hazelnut cakes were both really, really good; I would have a tough time choosing between them. END
BEGIN NOW  The hazelnut cake came warm from the oven and with homemade ice cream: yum! The cheesecake had a very strong goat aftertaste. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, we were very happy with our decision to try this great little cafe for restaurant week!. END
BEGIN NOW This was my first visit to this cute neighborhood gem. END
BEGIN NOW  I was quite impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Buzzy warm vibe on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW  Smaller restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating (enclosed patio with heaters). END
BEGIN NOW The menu was impressive because it was very unique. END
BEGIN NOW  Not your typical Italian eatery. END
BEGIN NOW  A lot to explore. END
BEGIN NOW  They also offer the option of a fix prix menu or a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW  We opted for a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW We began with the tuna crudo with watermelon radish and grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW  To accompany this appetizer we got the warm farro with hen of the woods mushrooms, cranberries, and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW  A fantastic pairing to share with the tuna crudo!. END
BEGIN NOW Next, we shared the pasta with tomatoe sauce and hot peppers. END
BEGIN NOW  A super cool feature that they offer is the option to order dishes as appetizer or entree size! I love this because it gives you a lot of freedom. END
BEGIN NOW  You can order a bunch of dishes and share them rather than just having one entree. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun!. END
BEGIN NOW Then there is the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW  Again, I was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Wines offered from many regions. END
BEGIN NOW  We explored some cool Italian whites and reds. END
BEGIN NOW  And once again, they allow you to order half or full glasses. END
BEGIN NOW  And they have a full menu of wine tasting flights. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun, fun, fun!. END
BEGIN NOW Our server was fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun guy, originally from Mexico, who clearly loves what he does. END
BEGIN NOW  Passionate. END
BEGIN NOW  Attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  Knowledgeable. END
BEGIN NOW  And just fun to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW We ended our meal with the most delicious goat cheese cheescake. END
BEGIN NOW  That was a first. END
BEGIN NOW and boy was it amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  Covered with pistachio toffee crumbles and paired with strawberries. END
BEGIN NOW  I would go back just to order that again. END
BEGIN NOW We will return. END
BEGIN NOW  Bravo. END
BEGIN NOW Finally. END
BEGIN NOW   OMG finally. END
BEGIN NOW   An Italian restaurant I can finally love coming too. END
BEGIN NOW   It's been a long, hard battle to even find a decent meal in the Bay Area, and I found my gem in the most boring part of this area. END
BEGIN NOW   Who would have guessed. END
BEGIN NOW Everything, from start to finish, was stellar. END
BEGIN NOW   Just complex enough to make you feel special, and simple enough where it felt casual. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect!  The $40 fix price menu is a steal. END
BEGIN NOW   We did that with an additional app, and a main, and the portions were right on. END
BEGIN NOW   The chocolate pot de creme desert. END
BEGIN NOW whoa. END
BEGIN NOW it's like a lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW on par with Angelines chocolate pot de creme and Chez Mama's choco lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW I will be back here again, and again. END
BEGIN NOW   It's simply stellar Italian. END
BEGIN NOW   Yes it's not a hip part of town, yes there are all old people in here, if you drove by you'd think some local dump restaurant that people go to because it's convenient. END
BEGIN NOW   You'd be wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Only miss:  I went to brunch before, and was not impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   At all. END
BEGIN NOW   I was skeptical when the gf said this is her fave place. END
BEGIN NOW   But after dinner, I took back my insults from the brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Three stars because this neighborhood needs one remaining place you can get a decent glass of wine in a cute setting. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is challenging. END
BEGIN NOW   Perhaps if you stick to apps and drinks you'll be alright, but the mains, in my experience, vary from over salted to mushy, to flavorless. END
BEGIN NOW  Good luck. END
BEGIN NOW I have no idea how Bellanico received it's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I was deceived. END
BEGIN NOW To summarize: great service, cute spot, feels over-crowded, food is not good and I will never come back. END
BEGIN NOW What we ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW Duck Pate - literally slabs of pate on toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Presentation was terrible and the pate taste off. END
BEGIN NOW Pork belly- not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW  It came on a skewer of chewy pork belly and fingerling potatoes and I liked the potatoes more. END
BEGIN NOW Ribeye - OK steak but nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW  Temperature was correct and came with bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW Being the snazzy little Yelper I am, I snagged a 6 pm reservation on the last day of Restaurant Week (truth: Mr. END
BEGIN NOW  P knew exactly what would brighten my day and stumbled across an abandoned reservation on Open Table). END
BEGIN NOW  This area can be a little limited in parking, so give yourself some extra time. END
BEGIN NOW Romantic lighting, enclosed patio seating, new silverware between each course. END
BEGIN NOW  this is a very nice date night with all the lovely details without being pretentious. END
BEGIN NOW  Very attentive and kind staff who put up with all my batty questions and gave me great suggestions. END
BEGIN NOW  (For whatever reason I have the hardest time figuring out what is on Italian menus unless it's crystal clear. END
BEGIN NOW  Agnolotti, tortelli, sformato. END
BEGIN NOW  err. END
BEGIN NOW ). END
BEGIN NOW I could slowly talk you through bite by bite, but I'm going to just get to the point. END
BEGIN NOW  The bacala was my absolute favorite, and I could probably eat the dark and white panna cotta every day for the rest of my life. END
BEGIN NOW  I think whatever you order here will be a delightful culinary experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Also it doesn't hurt coming here during restaurant week when you can indulge for just $30 per person. END
BEGIN NOW  Such a steal!. END
BEGIN NOW What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant! Bellanico is a local gem that has stellar service to match their scrumptious menu. END
BEGIN NOW We came here on a lazy Sunday with our two young kids. END
BEGIN NOW  They were offering their Oakland Restaurant week brunch menu for $24, to which you can add wine pairing for $10. END
BEGIN NOW Here's what we tried:. END
BEGIN NOW Burrata with roasted baby beets -- they make their own burrata, which works really well with the Grillo white paired with it. END
BEGIN NOW Braised and seared pork belly -- loved the crispy skin and tender meat, specially with the "Merlau" red. END
BEGIN NOW Poached eggs and prosciutto on country bread -- liked this version of Eggs Benedict, paired with a Bordeaux blanc. END
BEGIN NOW Butternut squash and goat cheese frittata -- fluffy and creamy, yet quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW  Paired well with a Loire white blend. END
BEGIN NOW Dark and white chocolate panna cotta -- rich and creamy. END
BEGIN NOW Florentine doughnuts - our kids loved this with the sage custard sauce and chocolate dip. END
BEGIN NOW  Only problem was that there were only 5 small pieces for $8. END
BEGIN NOW Goat cheese cheesecake with pistachio brittle -- my fave dessert, love the savory cheese with the crunchy brittle. END
BEGIN NOW Our brunch also came with complimentary muffins. END
BEGIN NOW  My kids loved these and our server was gracious enough to provide us with another helping! Overall, we highly recommend Bellanico and look forward to coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW Parking: It was a little tough and hard to find street parking. END
BEGIN NOW  Luckily on Sunday we found a few spots and parking was free. END
BEGIN NOW  With my handicapped brother it was also hard to find any parking near the hotel for easier access. END
BEGIN NOW  There were a few loading zone spots out front (handicapped can park there for as long as needed!) So if you have anyone that needs to be closer, that could work. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! So glad I chose this place for my birthday brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  I was able to make reservations a week in advance for a party of 7. END
BEGIN NOW  We got an excellent view of the lake and I really enjoyed the glass windows and interiors. END
BEGIN NOW  They had live jazz music playing as well! Impressive! Their Irish coffee is strong! Be forewarned!!! I needed a nap after. END
BEGIN NOW  I enjoyed the food as well, splitting a classic mushroom omelette and biscuits and gravy with my boyfriend. END
BEGIN NOW  They were able to do a side pancake for me which was nice since that was unlisted on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  I also tried a bit of the Jack London omelette, which had delicious chunks of crab in it. END
BEGIN NOW All in all its a great place to bring your family and they take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW  Good views, good food and good service. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect for special occasions or if you want a nice fancier atmosphere for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW We reserved a table for 4 people here on Saturday via opentable. END
BEGIN NOW  However, when we arrived it was clear they didn't want us there. END
BEGIN NOW  Even though we had a reservation, they didn't even ask our names. END
BEGIN NOW  Instead the hostess rudely quipped 'if you want to sit down you'll have to order within 2 minutes, we have an event today. END
BEGIN NOW ' We tried to explain we had a reservation and by now a few team members had come over but only to give us a similarly rude message 'if your party isn't here very soon, they can't order'. END
BEGIN NOW  We quickly left. END
BEGIN NOW This could all have been avoided by simply not accepting a reservation that you can't service, and when it happens - be nice about it. END
BEGIN NOW Coming to celebrate a graduation, we came to The Terrace Room for brunch as a big group on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW  With the exception of the view, I'd say the place is pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW Part I: The Untrained Waitress. END
BEGIN NOW Although the waitress was nice, she had no clue about the menu, how to properly pour a champagne and the fact that water should be refilled for clients. END
BEGIN NOW  Not only did she overpour the champagne glass, but managed to hold the bottle as if she is pouring vodka after a day at a Russian sauna (holding it with a grasp at the neck). END
BEGIN NOW  Didn't leave the cork on the table either. END
BEGIN NOW  Anyways, she didn't even know that Mumm sparkling wine was on the menu and I had to point her directly to it. END
BEGIN NOW  I mean, it's a brunch restaurant, there are 3 sparkling wines on the menu, does one really need a curriculum to learn them? Unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW Part II: The Standard Menu. END
BEGIN NOW Moving on, the menu is pretty average and the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't anything to make me brag about this spot to a friend, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Crab eggs Benedict and it was fine. END
BEGIN NOW  Another person at our table had the chorizo omelet and had similar impressions. END
BEGIN NOW Part III: The Shining. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, there is an area where they shine and I am confident they already know it. END
BEGIN NOW  The view from the table is killer, overlooking the lake, it just adds a relaxing feel to the whole establishment. END
BEGIN NOW  Good spot for family pictures. END
BEGIN NOW Conclusion:. END
BEGIN NOW Would I come back? Perhaps, if I ran out of other options to try, but it's an average restaurant with an above average view. END
BEGIN NOW  Had the waitress been better versed in the service industry, I would have given 4 stars for the view and food. END
BEGIN NOW We were here last night again for the Y's yearly Annual Campaign Victory dinner and I was looking forward to the beautiful view, spending time with friends and having a wonderful meal. END
BEGIN NOW   I can say that I had all three but there were some rude glitches along the way. END
BEGIN NOW   Dinner wasn't served until around 6:45 or 7 so we had a chance to have something to drink at the bar and chat with our friends. END
BEGIN NOW I used my yelp check-in and noticed that I could get $3 off any happy hour food or drinks so I showed the bartender my yelp check-in. END
BEGIN NOW   She indicated that if I was part of the Y event, that I could not use my happy hour check-in; however, I was paying for my alcoholic drink and it was not part of the banquet we were attending as other patrons were in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   That didn't seem fair to me. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I was able to get my discount for my drink. END
BEGIN NOW   Then later during the dinner, one of my friends at our table, asked for some ketchup and the waiter rudely indicated that ketchup was not part of the banquet menu, what????. END
BEGIN NOW Then when the delicious dessert was being served, the waiter was asking us who wanted coffee, another friend asked for his cup to be filled but he only had his cup filled 1/4?  I asked the same waiter for some coffee and mine was full. END
BEGIN NOW   This is the same waiter who refused to give another friend at our table ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know the wait staff was so rude. END
BEGIN NOW   I have never had a bad experience with the wait staff here at The Terrace Room. END
BEGIN NOW Going here transports me back to a by-gone era. END
BEGIN NOW  It's so easy sitting in this place to imagine how it was in the 20s. END
BEGIN NOW  It's especially nice when the sun is out and you get that nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  They have live music a lot, which obviously aligns with that historical period. END
BEGIN NOW  All this adds up to a really unique, fun and relaxing ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW They have pretty awesome drink specials when the do have happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW  If you ask me, they need to extend their happy hours a bit, as the place is never mobbed or anything. END
BEGIN NOW  It probably won't ever be a very trendy place as it IS inside a retirement home ;-) It's actually pretty neat on swing nights seeing the 20 somethings who are into swing cause it's cool again mix with the folks that dug it when it was cool originally. END
BEGIN NOW Although this place shares a building with a senior living center, it doesn't smell like old people. END
BEGIN NOW  Lol! They have a lounge area before entering the restaurant part with a piano which was dope. END
BEGIN NOW  Esp since there was someone there playing. END
BEGIN NOW The view of the lake is really what you're paying for here. END
BEGIN NOW  Our waitress, Brittany, was very professional and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  She was upbeat and prompt with anything we needed. END
BEGIN NOW  Loved how our champagne was never empty for too long. END
BEGIN NOW  $17 for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. END
BEGIN NOW  The + about this place is you can switch off between the two. END
BEGIN NOW  And they had a bloody mary bar for you to have fun with. END
BEGIN NOW The food was a little disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  The brunch menu was a bit limited and the quality of the food was below what it's worth. END
BEGIN NOW  However, they had a cute basket of mini muffins that were tasty and moist which was different from other brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW All in all it was good to try this place out. END
BEGIN NOW  I wouldn't mind coming here again but it would be for the view. END
BEGIN NOW  While the food wasn't horrible, there's nothing exciting about it either. END
BEGIN NOW This was a second dinner option selection due to a nearby restaurant that was closed for a private party. END
BEGIN NOW  Unfortunately we made the wrong choice and ate here. END
BEGIN NOW Yes it has an amazing view of Lake Merritt, but other than that this place doesn't have anything going to for them. END
BEGIN NOW The menu is small, I ordered the soup of the day which was mushroom creme, it was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing special and was somewhat separated. END
BEGIN NOW  For an entree I ordered roasted chicken that came with some kind of rice and scallions ($25) with a side of there potatoes ($6). END
BEGIN NOW  When the dish came it looked awful to begin with and was swimming in a pool of oil. END
BEGIN NOW  The roasted chicken was a pale skin color all over and had a lot of gristle. END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention is was two dark meat pieces (legs) the cheapest part of chicken meat. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes where whole but needed some sort of sauce that was absent. END
BEGIN NOW  The grains on the dish had a nice flavor but the greens and chicken were so overpowered by oil that it was difficult to enjoy any of this dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW The servers were friendly but it was unclear who our actual server was and we seemed to be seen mostly by the host who was busy seating. END
BEGIN NOW  It was not until the end of our meal that anyone checked in about how the experience was or if we need refills on drinks or water. END
BEGIN NOW Now, about an hour later our group has all ended up in the bathroom and. END
BEGIN NOW  How do I say this nicely. END
BEGIN NOW  But our stomachs are in a lot of pain and it's a good thing we like each other because there's some serious gas and bathroom time happening. END
BEGIN NOW This is the place for a girl's brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  First of all the lighting is amazing so all those selfies you're pretending you're not planning on taking will look INCREDIBLE. END
BEGIN NOW  The brunch options are diverse and doesn't have to kill your budget. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is a bit hit or miss, though. END
BEGIN NOW  My first time here I got the breakfast bagel sandwich and it was utter bliss, and everyone in my group (we were a party of 9) were served speedily and everyone was happy. END
BEGIN NOW  The next time I came, almost every person had a problem with their order (the wrong sides were brought out, goat cheese was missing from a goat cheese omelet). END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back again because this is a lovely place on lovely Lake Merritt, and I'll update this review to see if that day was a fluke or if it's a consistent thing. END
BEGIN NOW Regards, I'll be back because the service is great and the view is honestly worth it alone. END
BEGIN NOW As I predicted in my initial review, we didn't rush back here. END
BEGIN NOW   We returned for dinner and music tonight w/ Nina and Larry. END
BEGIN NOW   We found parking a few blocks away and arrived in time for our 6:30 reservations. END
BEGIN NOW   It was still light out and we had a lovely view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   One of the things that encouraged our return, beside the music, was knowing that Louis Le Gassic, formerly chef at Bay Wolf, had been appointed as their new Executive Chef. END
BEGIN NOW   We were excited to try the food. END
BEGIN NOW   The group, Juke Joint, started performing at 7:00 on the bandstand I had observed the last time we were there for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW We were brought menus and a plate of sliced bread w/ a ramekin of soft butter. END
BEGIN NOW   Nina, Larry and I all decided to have glasses of Malbec while Alan opted for a glass of Downtown Brown, which Larry shared. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered a cup of turnip and apple soup w/ a float of truffle oil on top. END
BEGIN NOW   Alan, Nina and I ordered rack of lamb, which came w/ white beans and garlic green beans and Larry ordered salmon. END
BEGIN NOW   Alan and I ordered a side of honey braised carrots. END
BEGIN NOW   The soup was smooth and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   The lamb was cooked medium rare and was topped w/ a tasty salsa verde, which was almost like chimichurri. END
BEGIN NOW   Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW   The carrots were good, as were the white and green beans. END
BEGIN NOW   The wine was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   For dessert Nina and I shared an Irish coffee crème brulée, which was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Alan had a fresh fruit plate. END
BEGIN NOW   He and Larry had coffee. END
BEGIN NOW   Service was smooth and just attentive enough. END
BEGIN NOW The music was marvelous. END
BEGIN NOW   Several couples got up to dance, which was fun to watch. END
BEGIN NOW   One in particular was sensational. END
BEGIN NOW   We really enjoyed it and would have stayed even longer than we did, but the band took a break and Larry was ready to go so we left. END
BEGIN NOW   According to the Terrace Room website they have live music Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and Sundays at 11:00 for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   They have quite an impressive lineup of folks scheduled to play and I can see us returning to hear more music w/ another enjoyable meal. END
BEGIN NOW Super delicious! My friend lives across the street and neither one of us had been here. END
BEGIN NOW  I had just finished the Nike Women's Half in SF so I rightfully needed to consume all the calories. END
BEGIN NOW We lucked out and scored a table immediately by the window. END
BEGIN NOW  Score. END
BEGIN NOW  I love a view. END
BEGIN NOW I fueled up with a cup of coffee ($4 - minus a star because I cannot understand why a cup of coffee is $4) and a water. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend ordered two eyes, with wheat toast, and mini waffles. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Jack London omelet (crab, arugula, hollandaise, and I had egg whites) with wheat toast, and home fries. END
BEGIN NOW  Mouth. END
BEGIN NOW  Watering. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the little fruit garnish and was close to licking the plate before Jack came to take it away. END
BEGIN NOW Jack was my server. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice, hipster looking fellow who was attentive, funny, and prompt. END
BEGIN NOW So four stars! I'll be back with for sure. END
BEGIN NOW just won't be getting $4 coffee. END
BEGIN NOW Terribly rude, we walked in with a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW  As soon as we walked in we were rudely asked to wait with no explanation, the hostess didnt even ask our name or if we had a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW When we explained our reservation, she chirped back that we'd have two minutes to order. END
BEGIN NOW Then the chef and another hostess came out to add to their rudeness and certainly NOT make us feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW  We turned around and walked out. END
BEGIN NOW  Never coming again. END
BEGIN NOW So I don't normally write yelp reviews, but I had a uniquely awful experience at the Terrace Room last night (Wednesday 4/20). END
BEGIN NOW  I'll start from the beginning:. END
BEGIN NOW I was walking around Lake Merritt around 6pm and heard some amazing live music coming from this gorgeous glass room across the street. END
BEGIN NOW  Naturally, I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW  I find myself in the Terrace Room, which is incredibly beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW  I decide to sit at the bar because I was not in the mood for a formal dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty busy but the bartender got to me in record time and whipped up a mean Old Fashioned (the classic old fashioned way with a sugar cube and muddler) and convinced me to order the nachos. END
BEGIN NOW  If this review was about the nachos alone, they'd be getting 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I'd had the foresight to snap a pic to post because they were a work of art. END
BEGIN NOW  The brisket was so tender and the cheese was definitely drool-inducing. END
BEGIN NOW  So let's just say I was in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Then, this tiny rude server starts complaining to her that she opened a bottle of wine for him that she shouldn't have. END
BEGIN NOW  (I really was not trying to pay attention but he was making a spectacle). END
BEGIN NOW  She immediately apologized, and gave him an unopened bottle and got back to making drinks for the large group of women at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Then, for whatever reason, he continued to harp on and on about the opened bottle of wine, which was very rude and unprofessional. END
BEGIN NOW  I was just trying to watch the bands on stage, but instead was so rudely distracted by this one-man show. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't know how the bartender kept her cool, I woulda lost it. END
BEGIN NOW  I also happened to make awkward eye contact with several other people sitting at the bar, sharing looks of discomfort/annoyance with the server's display, so I know I'm not just unusually observant. END
BEGIN NOW Thought he was done but oh no he comes back barking his orders at her. END
BEGIN NOW  What really got me was that when she'd rush to make the drinks, they'd then sit there for at least TEN minutes getting diluted/warm/shitty. END
BEGIN NOW  Honestly, I felt really bad for that woman. END
BEGIN NOW  just another example of men feeling the need to verbally abuse and dominate a young and talented girl. END
BEGIN NOW  I made it known to her that I respected and admired her hard work, and she just smiled and shrugged, as if it was no big deal. END
BEGIN NOW All in all I came to enjoy the music and food/drinks, but this tiny little man just kept ruining the ambience and experience. END
BEGIN NOW  It is beyond me how a manager and restaurant allows for such inappropriate behavior, let alone allow it to disrupt the experience of a patron. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks were great and the music wonderful, but it pains me too much to see that behavior, so I will not be coming back. END
BEGIN NOW Bottomless bloody Mary's and/or mimosas, what could be better?. END
BEGIN NOW Started off with a bloody Mary and told the waitress I would be switching to mimosas afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW  She forgot, no big so I had two bloody Mary's and then switched. END
BEGIN NOW I was going to get the chicken and waffles, but the waitress informed me that it was two wings and not breast as I had hoped so instead got the two egg breakfast with bacon and sausage. END
BEGIN NOW  They didn't skimp on the meat which was awesome and the English muffin was nicely toasted. END
BEGIN NOW They started us off with mini muffins and fresh jam that were a very nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW We sat by the window which provides an amazing view of the lake, overall great experience. END
BEGIN NOW Located in the same building in, or at least next door to, a senior living facility, the Terrace Room offers a gorgeous view of Lake Merritt from the west, which means that most of the time you won't be blinded by the sun like you would from the other side of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW The food offerings include all the usual dishes you'd expect of a mainstream Californian restaurant, with the dishes sticking more towards the familiar instead of the inventive. END
BEGIN NOW  Moreover, given the generally average quality of the dishes, the prices seem just a bit steep. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, the atmosphere here is rather quiet and sedate. END
BEGIN NOW  Adding to this is the fact that, lake view aside, the place feels like a country cottage. END
BEGIN NOW  Your best bet would probably be brunch, when you can enjoy a sunny view of the lake, and when other folks dining at the restaurant are also in sunny dispositions. END
BEGIN NOW They have TRIVIA every other monday night at 7:30!!! It's really fun. END
BEGIN NOW  The hosts are cool, the food is good, the drinks are fun (but kind of expensive). END
BEGIN NOW  The parking is easy then because its late on a monday. END
BEGIN NOW  I parked right against the lake, literally in front of the building. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're looking for a place in Oakland to play trivia - you've found it. END
BEGIN NOW  The questions range from anything about pop culture, history, oakland themed, etc. END
BEGIN NOW  It's hard, but not too hard. END
BEGIN NOW  6 people to a team. END
BEGIN NOW  The prizes are gift certificates to the Terrace room. END
BEGIN NOW  I had a blast when I went with my friends. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll definitely be going back!. END
BEGIN NOW Note: The entrace to the terrace room is through the hotel entrance. END
BEGIN NOW  ((I had trouble finding it the first time I went there)). END
BEGIN NOW Ok, first of all, one of the bartenders are not very nice. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is slow, and I'm not sure if it was the colour of my skin, or just lack of skill, but I didn't feel very welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW  The girl, Molly was nice, and I appreciated her interaction. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, it literally took 40 minutes on a not so busy night to get a grilled cheese sandwich (which I had tipped before getting it). END
BEGIN NOW  I was so offended and turned off of my interaction, and the way the bar tender treated my fiend and I, I did not eat my food. END
BEGIN NOW I also love how the bartender commented "you know no body cares" while I wrote this review, and yes this comment was directed at me. END
BEGIN NOW  HE WAS SO RUDE ! Won't recommend a place that doesn't care about their customers, just saying!. END
BEGIN NOW very nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  not the most crowded on a friday night but it was kind of nice not having to shove your way through everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW  seems like more of a started bar?. END
BEGIN NOW someone said that they have amazing whiskey sours in their review. END
BEGIN NOW  i was excited but disappointed that they served their whiskey sours in the -not with egg white- fashion. END
BEGIN NOW  nevertheless, it was still well made. END
BEGIN NOW  but again, just thought the drinks were reasonably priced and jsut good. END
BEGIN NOW Meet my favorite cocktail bar in Oakland! I last ended up here after being booted out of Fauna. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, Fauna, when will you do something about your absurdly early last call times? We decided to head down the street and continue the festivities for my birthday. END
BEGIN NOW After getting a nice happy birthday wish from the doorman, we headed inside to grab some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The cocktails here were, as usual, amazingly tasty and reasonably priced ($9 - $12). END
BEGIN NOW  If memory serves me correct, I stuck with my favorites: Bee's Knees and Stones Throw. END
BEGIN NOW  Hooray for ginger beer! And, hooray for cool bartenders too!. END
BEGIN NOW It was just after midnight on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW  Our group was able to secure a table, relax, and enjoy the rest of the night. END
BEGIN NOW Tip: This place is conveniently located nearby the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW Bonus Birthday Tip: There's a food stand about a block away with bacon-wrapped hot dogs! As if that wasn't enough, the woman running the stand is absolutely hilarious!. END
BEGIN NOW Dogwood is a solid bar in a happening stretch of town, right near the Fox Theatre where Telegraph branches off Broadway towards the north. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a good variety of tasty cocktails to choose from, and the bartenders are knowledgeable and and friendly enough to make anything you want. END
BEGIN NOW  What's more, there's a decent menu of munchies, like the totally delicious cubanito sandwich I tried. END
BEGIN NOW  While the interior might feel a bit dark as you walk in, you'll adjust quickly to the cozy yet retro-sleek ambience. END
BEGIN NOW Also, you have to give the owners credit for sticking it out here over the years. END
BEGIN NOW  Dogwood is located on such a busy street corner that drunk drivers have crashed into it twice, while rioters have also smashed the windows twice. END
BEGIN NOW  Nevertheless, the area is on the way up and  the owners have bounced back each time. END
BEGIN NOW  Judging by the healthy crowds this place gets, it looks like the community has embraced Dogwood as well. END
BEGIN NOW Came here before a show at the Fox Theater to grab a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW The bees knees was sweet and yummy. END
BEGIN NOW  It's dangerous because it really doesn't taste like alcohol at all. END
BEGIN NOW  The 2nd cocktail I had (and the name I completely forgot) was described by the bartender as an adult version of an orange julius, and she was spot on. END
BEGIN NOW  It was refreshing and the egg whites made it super rich and frothy. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried a sip of what the bf drank (stones throw and farmer's daughter) and they were all good!. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, we had to try the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  And the reviews aren't kidding when they say it's BOMB DOT COM. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect to munch on with your drinks!! Buttery, cheesy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't busy when we went so we were able to find seats and service was quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW $5 for a delicious, buttery, perfectly pressed grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  The option to add sundried tomato, basil, and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  Little cornichons on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  Mustard (the good stuff, mind you, none of that French's yellow) provided without asking. END
BEGIN NOW  Dogwood literally served me my dream sandwich on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW  If that isn't culinary inception, I don't know what is. END
BEGIN NOW As for cocktails, they are creative, tasty, and strong. END
BEGIN NOW  I love the Brooklyn, and the Bees Knees is, well, the BEES KNEES. END
BEGIN NOW  It's true you may have to wait - Dogwood can be packed late at night, and usually have just one bartender during happy hours/early evening. END
BEGIN NOW  I hate waiting, but if I had to wait, there's nowhere I'd rather hang around than a converted apothecary/pharmacy where the smell of grilled cheese permeates every corner. END
BEGIN NOW I think the bar is ok. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been here many times so obviously it is good enough to come back to. END
BEGIN NOW   The reason for the two stars is that I've just experienced way better. END
BEGIN NOW   When I think about Dogwood, I think about a place that is just like any 'ol Mission hipster bar in the City but trying to not be that way because it is very "Oakland and proud" but, nonetheless, is just like a Mission hipster bar in the city. END
BEGIN NOW   The well drinks are watered down but the cocktails are good (and overpriced, just like any Mission hipster bar). END
BEGIN NOW  Except therein lies the problem, this is Oakland, not the City, so the bar would be better just being Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW I have found the bartenders to range from being very friendly to ratchet. END
BEGIN NOW  who would have thought?  Also, any bartender that doesn't know what is in a Cape Cod should not be working as a bartender (IMHO). END
BEGIN NOW I'm a fan of the grilled cheese and cheese/meat plates which I do like and appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm sure I'll be back to this bar at some point but this isn't really a place I care to go to on the regular. END
BEGIN NOW This place is ok if you don't mind paying those "new Oakland" prices and rub shoulders with the sf crowd, ooops, I mean new Oakland crowd that has taken over Downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW Service used to be pretty good but is now pretty bad, don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks were decent, a little slow on service. END
BEGIN NOW   A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW Would have given a better review if they had not doubled the tip i originally gave them. END
BEGIN NOW   Be careful with using your credit card here. END
BEGIN NOW Had a nice, low-key evening at Dogwood on a Monday night!. END
BEGIN NOW I came out to Oakland from SF to meet a friend, and loved that this place was a block away from the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and basil, and it was absolutely delicious!  I also enjoyed my ginger beer cocktail, as well as a glass of wine. END
BEGIN NOW The service was very friendly, though we did have to go up to the bar to place our orders. END
BEGIN NOW The place wasn't too loud or busy on a Monday night, which made it a great atmosphere for catching up with an old friend. END
BEGIN NOW The prices are reasonable too!. END
BEGIN NOW I have visited this place many times, but I can't find myself to give a review. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel the place is too pretentious, pricy, and unfriendly bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  The only redeeming quality of the place is the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention very cramp. END
BEGIN NOW I have since changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW  I like the expansion and the food window. END
BEGIN NOW  More room, feel more friendly, and It feel more accepting. END
BEGIN NOW  Though, I was a bit tipsy because it was birthday. END
BEGIN NOW  I may have to check back again to give another try. END
BEGIN NOW What I had: the bees knees, various grilled cheese sandwiches, pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW Visit date: January 13, 2015. END
BEGIN NOW First time? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Twas a fun evening at Dogwood. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the bees knees - it was a decent drink, sweet and sour. END
BEGIN NOW  What really stood out were the snacks! We had two kinds of grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  One had tomato jam and the other had tomato and basil. END
BEGIN NOW  Both were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread had a crisp outside and soft inside. END
BEGIN NOW  The cheese was gooey and warm. END
BEGIN NOW  I have a special place in my tummy for tomato jam and Dogwood's was an A+. END
BEGIN NOW  The dijon dipping sauce added a nice touch, too. END
BEGIN NOW  So did the pickles. END
BEGIN NOW There are plenty of seats around and open space to stand around or dance. END
BEGIN NOW  Order your food at the bar and they'll bring it out to you. END
BEGIN NOW Another venue that endearingly screams "Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW " This a long, narrow joint that somehow manages to pack in lots of people at the bar and in seated areas along the wall, all while featuring a dance stage in the back. END
BEGIN NOW  The setting feels old-school, almost Art Deco-ish. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd is casual, friendly, and unpretentious, as is to be expected of Oakland, and there's a large menu of yummy cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite the fact that it can get busy on weekends, waits at the bar are never too long, and you can fit yourself in, whether with groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW 've been to Three Fifty-Five twice in the last few years, and I enjoyed both visits. END
BEGIN NOW The bar is a narrow space off of 19th Street. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a proper bar, followed by some tables and a dance floor in back. END
BEGIN NOW The drink menu is good - and cheap! My wife and I both enjoyed two cocktails each on our most recent visit, and the price tag was around $8 or $9. END
BEGIN NOW Service was friendly and efficient, which is welcome given that crowds start streaming in after nine. END
BEGIN NOW I'd be back if I were looking for a more intimate bar in downtown Oakland (until it gets a little rowdier in the later hours). END
BEGIN NOW You know, considering how Bar Three Fifty Five wasn't even our intended destination, I'd say our experience here was a pleasant surprise. END
BEGIN NOW   Not that I ever thought the place would be bad. END
BEGIN NOW   Not when, moments after checking in on Yelp, fellow Yelper Vi T. END
BEGIN NOW  commented, "good choice". END
BEGIN NOW   Talk about a stamp of approval!. END
BEGIN NOW People have described the place as a nicer type of dive, and I guess I can kind of see that. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I'd say it's more like an old school bar (think Tosca Cafe in SF), what with its aged charm and decor (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW   There's still a bit of an Oakland vibe in the air though, and the small stage in back makes them pretty different in comparison, but that bar!  Love the look of it, as well as their slate of alcohol that fills their shelves and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW The cocktail menu is short and sweet (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW com/biz_photos/bar-…), and not very expensive at $8 a pop (no wonder they're so beloved!). END
BEGIN NOW   Everything sounded great, but, on my friend's recommendation, I opted for the STARDUST REMEDY (Pimm's, Calvados, Ginger, Lime, and Falernum). END
BEGIN NOW   The name may sound child friendly, but this cocktail is definitely mature. END
BEGIN NOW   Balanced flavors with a decent pour, refreshing with some bite, and well-crafted by a bartender/mixologist that knows her stuff (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW Since we arrived relatively early, snagging a table for the six of us was relatively easy, as was parking around the corner. END
BEGIN NOW   However, don't be surprised if the place gets packed to the gills as the night goes on. END
BEGIN NOW   As we were leaving, a steady stream of folks were filing in (it's just two blocks over from The Fox Theater). END
BEGIN NOW   Either way, Bar Three Fifty Five is worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW and one of my new favorite bars in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW Great cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  Dark and intimate venue. END
BEGIN NOW good for a date spot if you're into it. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd is hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW  Younger professional crowd around happy hour, older 30s to 40s crowd later in the night. END
BEGIN NOW OMGGGGG the red hair bartender is the rudest person ever I have never been treated like THATTT!!!!!!!she was the RUDEST person ever!!!!!! I just asked for a tequila drink and just repplied with if u want I can make u a paloma as only option efortless cuz was 1 am. END
BEGIN NOW  I agreed she came with a poorly made "paloma" my peers tryed and said tasfted rotted as I thpughtttttt cuz was goss. END
BEGIN NOW  Gave it back telling her something was wrong I wanted a last word and OMG she started saying bad words and throw it in my face complaining. END
BEGIN NOW  Came back with a poorly made, of course. END
BEGIN NOW  "Last word" OMG WiTH ICE IN THE DRINKKKKKKKKK when this drink was served UP!!#!#!!!!! I work in the industry and I WOULDVE FIRED HER ASS IN THE SPOT. END
BEGIN NOW  Im a current customer and your are going to see my face often and return drinks if they are bad. END
BEGIN NOW  I dont know how you can call youself bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  Its not about knowledge or skills (missing on you, higly noticeable) you also need peolpe skills. END
BEGIN NOW My food was burned and waaaaaay too over priced for what it is, sorry I hate to leave bad comments, but this is the third time in a row I have terrible. END
BEGIN NOW food. END
BEGIN NOW I'm very surprised that I have not written a review for 355. END
BEGIN NOW  I was here last night and it had been, possibly, a year and a half since I was last here. END
BEGIN NOW  Had a written a review of this, I probably would have given this place three stars. END
BEGIN NOW The reason being, I never really cared too much for this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Every time I would come here in the past, it was because other people wanted to go here. END
BEGIN NOW  I just always thought they were trying WAY too hard with their cocktails and never wanted to come in here on my own accord. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday, the lovely Lorrayne suggested meeting here for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  I was for it and since it had been so long since I was last here, I decided to give it another chance. END
BEGIN NOW  To my surprise, the menu changed. END
BEGIN NOW  It actually made sense and didn't give me a headache trying to look through it. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried their 19th Street Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW  It was good. END
BEGIN NOW  After that, I had to try their Gin & Housemade Tonic. END
BEGIN NOW  I love gin and I love gin & tonics. END
BEGIN NOW  Theirs was so good, I had three of them. END
BEGIN NOW  Lorrayne ordered a Dark & Stormy, which is also another one of my favorite drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  She let me have a taste. END
BEGIN NOW  It was very delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  It seems like they top theirs off with egg white and Lorrayne also informed me that they also make their ginger beer in house. END
BEGIN NOW So I must give thanks to Lorrayne for actually making me interested in Bar 355. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back here, even if it's on my own. END
BEGIN NOW There are definitely hipsters here but not the annoying ones that think listening to their grandparents songs on a gramophone is cool. END
BEGIN NOW This place is the definition of great vibes! I love this place!. END
BEGIN NOW Make Westing brings out a diverse and social crowd. END
BEGIN NOW  The music is low but still vibrant, which creates a great setting to mingle without screaming. END
BEGIN NOW  Feel free to get into an intense and fun game of bocce ball! Even standing around and watching is entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW  My friends and I meet and network with many amazing people all the time! Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. END
BEGIN NOW Our go to drink is the FRENCH MUSE, a must have! It looks all cute and innocent, but it is slightly dangerous! 1 will have you in a chillin' mood, 2 tipsyyy, and 3 LIT!! You will feel like you have been drinking all night, which is pretty much drink goals! My limit is usually 3, I don't dare go past! I always have a great time here! Each element of Make Westing creates the perfect ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW This is definitely the spot to go for after work drinks, pre-games, or weekend hangouts! One of my favorite places in Oakland by far!. END
BEGIN NOW Hipster bar alert. END
BEGIN NOW Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW  For the most part, it has a comfortable, inviting environment. END
BEGIN NOW  The indoor bocce ball courts are a nice touch, but be prepared to wait a while until one opens up. END
BEGIN NOW  By the same token, don't take too long when you get a court!. END
BEGIN NOW I took off a star because an employee was super rude to me for no particular reason. END
BEGIN NOW  He was clearing glasses from the bocce court area and was walking back toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I was inadvertently blocking his pathway, but instead of asking me politely to step to the side, he said in a sarcastic, annoyed tone, "It would help if you moved. END
BEGIN NOW " Typically, that's not how you would want to treat your customers, but hey, they didn't ask me. END
BEGIN NOW Been here a few times for drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Cool hipster place in downtown Oakland, slow on Mondays and usually very busy Thursday-Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW They make really good gimlets and mojitos. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartenders are friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  They have appetizers as well but I cannot rate them on that since I just go there for drinks, however the habanero popcorn looked really yummy the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW Very chill place to mingle with the locals in the area, definitely a place you can wear tennis shoes or heels. END
BEGIN NOW  Recommend this place to anyone looking to go to watch the games or hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW Braised oxtail sando!!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW I was able to sample there Braised oxtail sandwich and let me say I will be back for more, not oily, not fatty, near perfection on a toasted bun. END
BEGIN NOW  The sandwich on a whole was a tad small, especially if you are sharing, but the meat was tender and flavorful, not to salty, more or less all around perfect on meat to bun proportion. END
BEGIN NOW I also sampled the bone marrow dish, no skimming on this dish, full heavy amount of bone marrow on the bone, like most places that offer this dish you are scraping the bone to get every last bit, here the marrow was heavy, oily, thick consistency, throw it on some toasted bread that is offered and it is delicious, you can dip the bread in the sauce found underneath the bone, ohh man sooo good,. END
BEGIN NOW I do recommend this place for the food, I did sample few beers, I would stay for there food that they offer. END
BEGIN NOW food **** oxtail sandwich is a plus, bone marrow also a plus. END
BEGIN NOW service **** no wait, walked up to the bar and ordered, received the food in 5 min. END
BEGIN NOW price $$. END
BEGIN NOW ambiance **** large venue, bochi ball not regulated size but folks compete here, allot of room to stretch your legs, better to go on a week night to avoid several crowds during the friday and saturday crowds. END
BEGIN NOW I will be back for more oxtail and bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW Love Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW  Located in what is now Uptown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing is serving up quality hand crafted cocktails from some of the most friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW  What I enjoy most at Make Westing is the cheese selection. END
BEGIN NOW  Cow , Sheep or goat. END
BEGIN NOW  I always go for the cow and each time I fall in love. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing is serving Brie at its peak temp and they got it right. END
BEGIN NOW Outdoor seating with views of the hustle and bustle of the city. END
BEGIN NOW  Old school tavern feel inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Indoor Bocce. END
BEGIN NOW  clean restrooms and comfortable seating. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing is definitely key for Oakland Nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW I've had each of their house cocoktails and they are amazing. END
BEGIN NOW I've visited this bar twice and both times I felt extremely uncomfortable and out of place. END
BEGIN NOW After finding a seat at the bar, I was ignored by all three bartenders for atleast 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  Eventually, I enthusiastically waved one of the bartenders down to get his attention. END
BEGIN NOW  When he finally acknowledged me, he seemed annoyed or bothered that I wanted to BUY a drink. END
BEGIN NOW This bar seems to cater to a very specific crowd, which baffles me in the ever so diverse Bay Area of CA. END
BEGIN NOW I never understand how customer service can be so bad and/or exclusive especially when they don't realize that they are offending patrons that are spending their money in these establishments. END
BEGIN NOW I likely will never return to this place as long as it is the Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW Interesting!. END
BEGIN NOW This place has a special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW  It is where I first met my husband and where he later proposed. END
BEGIN NOW I still haven't been able to persuade anyone to play bocce ball with me. END
BEGIN NOW  :(. END
BEGIN NOW Here are the perks. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're usually a designated driver this place is still a lot of fun. END
BEGIN NOW  There is bocce and spicy popcorn to be had. END
BEGIN NOW   There are friendly bartenders who don't stank face you for not consuming alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW  They are bright enough to realize they can sell or give you something non alcoholic and that they can sell even more drinks to your pals who are imbibing. END
BEGIN NOW   They know the score!!! :). END
BEGIN NOW After the office Christmas party I and a small handful of my coworkers still wanted to be out and about, so we made our way from The Lake Chalet over to Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW  We somehow managed to grab a table with seats for all five of us in the incredibly packed place, and after perusing the menu of house cocktails I decided on a Garden Gimlet (gin, cucumber, basil, and lime). END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a big drinker and have always had a hard time finding cocktails I like, but the Garden Gimlet was really refreshing and light. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW The bocce court was in full swing, the music was really good, and everyone seemed in good spirits. END
BEGIN NOW  It was loud but we could still have a conversation, and in general the atmosphere was really positive. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a cool place whether you're coming as a group or a couple, and I'd definitely like to come here again. END
BEGIN NOW This is one of the least approachable bars on Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW  I've eaten the food here, and ended up bloody from bones which were not removed from the meat. END
BEGIN NOW  I've also enjoyed myself here many times after work in previous years when it was comfortable, it's when they bring in the bouncers on weekend nights that you are asking to be treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW  I would AVOID this bar until they hire more appropriate staff. END
BEGIN NOW  I would always love to support local business, but this place is not safe. END
BEGIN NOW You'll notice the reviews are dropping on this place because its going down hill fast. END
BEGIN NOW  I would give it zero stars if I could after my recent visit. END
BEGIN NOW You never know who you'll see at this bar!. END
BEGIN NOW A group of friends met up here before the Allen Stone concert at The Fox Theatre, and low and behold, the man himself is hanging out at the bar with friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Super cool. END
BEGIN NOW It's a typical laid back, casual, hipster bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Good prices, lots of space, and and nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd come back here before a show next time, too!. END
BEGIN NOW The last three times I've been in Radio bar they've had this human body mutilation video on which is kind of disturbing, but you can ignore it by keeping your gaze ahead toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  What you can't ignore is the crazy loud music when it's cranked. END
BEGIN NOW  The latter is the only thing about this bar that I don't like, probably because I prefer to be able to hear what people are saying without having to scream WHAT? repeatedly only to give up and nod politely. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks are cheap and the bar is dark. END
BEGIN NOW  Stools are comfortable, and occasionally there are patrons inside who compliment your teeth!. END
BEGIN NOW perhaps other than the fact that it seems to attract a lot of. END
BEGIN NOW If you don't like Radio then you are likely:. END
BEGIN NOW a) a pretentious prick from the 'burbs or SF. END
BEGIN NOW b) a hipster douche canoe who got lost on their way to Make Westing (much respect for MW bartenders, their evening crowd just sucks). END
BEGIN NOW c) a whiny waste of space on this planet. END
BEGIN NOW d) not friends with me, thank god. END
BEGIN NOW Zhiva, Melissa, Marni and the rest of the Radio crew are some of the nicest, most real people you will meet in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW  If they don't like you, you are probably a jerk with attitude and they are hoping you leave so the rest of us don't have to deal with your dumb-shit vibe. END
BEGIN NOW That said, drinks are always strong and always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Music is constantly changing so don't complain if you don't like it. END
BEGIN NOW  If you don't like dark red-lit places, you should move along. END
BEGIN NOW If you can let your hair down with a bunch of nice people and don't want to get ripped off while you drink, this is your bar. END
BEGIN NOW Cool Divey spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Very chill vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure where they got the Asian decor inspiration from, but the red lights do set a decent tone. END
BEGIN NOW  Bartenders were nice, service was good. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely one of the nastiest bathrooms I've seen in my Day! Hah Kudos for that! Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW Meh. END
BEGIN NOW It's a cool place to hang out, have drinks and listen to the DJ spin, but the bathrooms are hideous and the place is kind of small. END
BEGIN NOW  Dancing is out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks are good and the people seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW  It's just ok in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW Although I was the only person of Asian descent in the crowd here when I showed up, Radio appears to pay homage to its location near Chinatown by offering an intimate atmosphere that's not only lit dimly by lights in large red paper lanterns, but also punctuated by screens playing kung fu movies. END
BEGIN NOW The atmosphere seems to be both loungey and dive bar-ish at the same time, while the overall vibe is friendly, approachable, and intimate. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll make a point of coming back and trying out some more of their drinks. END
BEGIN NOW My friends and I were checking around Oakland for a good nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW  Being as its not the city we stumbled across Radio. END
BEGIN NOW  We went on a Friday night and the moment we got in we fell in love with the vibe and music. END
BEGIN NOW  Even though its small (since its a dive bar)  they have a good selection of alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW If you're looking for drinks accompanied with good hip hop and the bay area hyphy vibe this is the place to go. END
BEGIN NOW The place is tiny and cute- a little tight with the crowd it brings in but the atmosphere is loud and exciting. END
BEGIN NOW  The music bumps loudly and the bartenders are lively. END
BEGIN NOW  I was here via route bar hopping on Halloween night. END
BEGIN NOW  I really enjoyed the extra lighting and accent of the lanterns on the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW The walls are lined with mirrors (which is a great idea for a small place), the bar expands most of the room, there is no dance floor but of course, no dance floor is no excuse not to shake your hips. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're lucky, you can find tables and seats in the back corner. END
BEGIN NOW This is someplace I would def come back to check out on a night that isn't Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun!!. END
BEGIN NOW This is a dark and divey bar with a pretty laid-back vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  It's narrow and sort of hard to move around much. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartender was cool and suggested a great cocktail for me when she found she didn't have all the ingredients for a Corpse Reviver #2. END
BEGIN NOW  My biggest complaint was the ladies room. END
BEGIN NOW  It was very tiny, not very clean, and the toilet was clogged. END
BEGIN NOW  I hope I would find it in better condition on my next visit. END
BEGIN NOW Damn so I really loved this bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I was going a couple times a week (more like every day around 4 after work). END
BEGIN NOW  Will not be returning unfortunately. END
BEGIN NOW   I have been there at times and had an awesome experience with different bar tenders. END
BEGIN NOW   The long haired dude who drives a sick bike! Amazing and sooper nice. END
BEGIN NOW   This past 3 or 4 times I have always gotten service from a little ass hole of a chick. END
BEGIN NOW   First she's a jerk, 2nd,never smiles, and third she just has an unkind persona. END
BEGIN NOW   Like she doesn't want you there. END
BEGIN NOW I go back at different times in hopes that she is NOT there but she is. END
BEGIN NOW On several occasions she has not only been rude to me but my girlfriend as well. END
BEGIN NOW   Instances of refusing water because she's closing her register, or telling me to ask some one else in the most Dickish way. END
BEGIN NOW Damn lady thanks to YOU you lost a loyal customer. END
BEGIN NOW   MAKE THAT TWO. END
BEGIN NOW I used to always catch a last drink here before hopping on BART, so of them many times, a one drink stint is all I've really lingered for. END
BEGIN NOW   And to tell ya the troof, that is all I can really muster in here. END
BEGIN NOW First, the place is thin and narrow, but long. END
BEGIN NOW   If you aren't lucky enough to get a seat at the bar (which is probable), then you have to plaster your back against the long wall. END
BEGIN NOW   And the space between the back of the stools and your face, is literally about 3 feet. END
BEGIN NOW   And in that 3 foot space is where the rest of the schleps will have to walk, back and forth in order to get to the rest rooms. END
BEGIN NOW And to add to the insult, if it is a warm night, say 70's-80's, it will be 10-20 degrees warmer inside because I'm not sure if they have AC. END
BEGIN NOW   When the place fills up, all that body heat just compounds the problem. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't know how the bartenders are able to work in that heat. END
BEGIN NOW   Like clothes sticking to your skin. END
BEGIN NOW heat. END
BEGIN NOW   Like, let's get outa here after this drink. END
BEGIN NOW heat. END
BEGIN NOW But outside of a few major logistical issues, this place is a dive in true form. END
BEGIN NOW   Decent cheap drinks, great music (must be from a shuffler cuz I didn't notice a juke) usually throwbacks of some sort. END
BEGIN NOW   Diverse crowd and quintessential dive bar lighting (red district red). END
BEGIN NOW   A drink here will evoke memories of intimate meetings of elaborate schemes of a devious nature. END
BEGIN NOW   But that's just me watching way too many Tarantino flicks. END
BEGIN NOW   Now if it can bring me there, then it can't be all bad, now can it?. END
BEGIN NOW *throws in extra star*. END
BEGIN NOW I want start this off by complimenting the bar itself I have always liked the environment and have felt invited to come in , I live in the area so I'm around the bar often. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm writing this review based on how I was treated twice upon trying to enter the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm 22 with a baby face so u get carded (no problem with that) , I don't like how I was treated by one of the female staff who was completely rude and disrespectful to me because I don't look my age after I gave multiple forms of ID ,credit cards I  even showed a medical record and birth certificate  I should have never have had to go that far. END
BEGIN NOW  After being turned away by the woman my second time trying to enter the bar the same woman told me that she would only serve me if the bar next door would serve me , so I literally went there and I was served without hesitation after being carded she walked into the bar and asked the bartender if he was going to serve me he replied yes. END
BEGIN NOW  Then she se said to me ok well I'm still not serving you ,your not worth it your not worth me losing my job at the bar so drink here. END
BEGIN NOW  I told her that I didn't want to go there and asked her why she was treating me that way and she replied because u look too young I don't care what your I'd says. END
BEGIN NOW I wish I had the name of the woman who was rude but unfortunately  I don't I feel the way she handled everything was wrong especially to turn a customer away to somewhere else just to come inside of that place where you do not work just  to turn them away is unprofessional and tacky. END
BEGIN NOW OTHER THAN THIS INCIDENT ID SAY FIVE STAR TO THE BAR AND IT'S CREATED  ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW Coolish dive bar, but ultimately just a dive bar with some very red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW   I look at the entrace to this bar every day, since I can see it from my work, but this was my first venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW The bartender was interesting and chatty, and the beer selection was OK. END
BEGIN NOW   The very red lighting I didn't care much for, but I guess that's its shtick. END
BEGIN NOW  Ultimtely though, to me, it's just another bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not sure it'd be my first choice for after work - I might go to the Tribune instead which has a better beer selection, and food. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars for the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  They are strong and CHEAP. END
BEGIN NOW  $4 for a gin and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW  That's cheaper than a beer at most places!. END
BEGIN NOW I went on a Friday night and the music was an interesting mix of early 2000's R&B  and some stuffs that I had never heard before. END
BEGIN NOW  It was sort of hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW  It would start off with Shaggy "Wasn't Me" then would abruptly change to some tribal beat type deal. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe I'm ignorant to good music or not cultured. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe cultured people enjoy the music more. END
BEGIN NOW  All I know is I'm most happy when old school Nelly is playing uninterrupted for the entire night but maybe that's just me. END
BEGIN NOW Plea to the manager: PLEASE stop letting people in when the place is saturated. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar is tiny. END
BEGIN NOW  By 11 pm it was nearly impossible to move yet I noticed the bouncer letting more and more people in. END
BEGIN NOW  We ended up leaving because it was so crowded and hot and not worth it :/. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I give the place the 4 stars because I like the laidback vibe, the cheap drinks, and the hip hop/R&B jams. END
BEGIN NOW A hipsterish establishment that's super, super dark. END
BEGIN NOW  So dark, in fact, that you'd half expect to see the Milky Way galaxy hovering overhead as if you were on a middle school stargazing trek somewhere super remote. END
BEGIN NOW But instead of worrying about zombies popping out of the forest like you did on those dark stargazing treks, you'll have to deal with, well, hipsters and other more borderline types, who for all you know could indeed be walking zombies after a drink or a joint or two. END
BEGIN NOW  The dim red lighting doesn't accentuate people's best features, and you never know if people are staring at you just because they're also having a hard time seeing, or if they really really are creepy. END
BEGIN NOW I appreciate that there are divey places like this in Oakland, but I also appreciate that there are many other places in Oakland to choose from that are more happening and more my style. END
BEGIN NOW I dig it here. END
BEGIN NOW  Cheap happy hour from 4-9pm, they have Manhattan (my kinda drink), Martini, Lemon drop and Margarita all for $5. END
BEGIN NOW  It's really dark when you first walk in but your eyes will adjust eventually and all you see is the red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW  There are pool tables all the way in the back but it's also where the smokers are which I'm not a fan of cigarette smoke so I stay away from there. END
BEGIN NOW  DJ plays music after 10 or something like that and there's a small dancefloor so it gets packed around that time. END
BEGIN NOW  Bartenders and security were pretty friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't like that the bathroom only has one stall and can get pretty nasty but hey, it's to be expected at any bars right! It's a good spot to go to after work to decompress or meet up with friends for a good night and parking is always easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, Bartender chick socializing with her friends with her back to me. END
BEGIN NOW  (For over 10 mins). END
BEGIN NOW You suck and you're not as cool as you think. END
BEGIN NOW  You saw us and went about hooking your friends up with free drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  You should be fired. END
BEGIN NOW As for the bar, loved the dingy vibe with the added hip hop. END
BEGIN NOW  Usually, dives like this play metal which is what I'm used to. END
BEGIN NOW Too bad they didn't know who I was. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't make it into the annual Autumn Lights Festival and were waiting in line in the cold with 1,000+ people. END
BEGIN NOW  We left and took a stroll on Lake Merrit and decided to continue the night in a better fashion. END
BEGIN NOW  We weren't sure what to expect and I didn't brush up on my Yelp reviews of this place, however, didn't think it was too bad of an idea. END
BEGIN NOW We walked in and the place is completely dark. END
BEGIN NOW  You can literally piss or barf in the corner somewhere of at the bar, and no one would even notice it. END
BEGIN NOW  The light bulbs were all red tinted, which made the whole place blood red. END
BEGIN NOW  It's def. END
BEGIN NOW  appropriate for it's name. END
BEGIN NOW and for Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW There was no music that night, unfortunately, because drinking and dancing is always a great pair. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks were cheap, the bartender was friendly, and clientele was "freakish". END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe it was just the lighting. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is small in size, not sure where the dance floor would have taken place if there was a DJ playing that night. END
BEGIN NOW We grabbed drinks and headed to a closed off back side where pool and chain smoking took place. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd was decent, mostly groups of friends hanging out. END
BEGIN NOW  However, the tables were mostly covered in grossness and the seats weren't too clean either, but it's a dive bar- that's how they get the label right?. END
BEGIN NOW I can see this place as a good stop on a night of bar hopping, maybe to pre-game and have smokes indoors, but definitely not a place to just hang out at all night. END
BEGIN NOW Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW  Requested fun  dance music for the ladies completely crowded AROUND the deserted dance floor. END
BEGIN NOW  The DJ  took a full 15 MIN to transition to dance party tunes that filled the dance floor for half an hour. END
BEGIN NOW   Everyone was so happy! Then the dirge of indulgent "ni**a ni**a blessed pu*sy" - you can't make this up, music that cleared the floor. END
BEGIN NOW  When asked WTF I was told there was a 'formula' to get people to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Horrible club. END
BEGIN NOW  Terrible drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  If you want to dance, look elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW  The DJ is faaaaaaaar too into himself to keep the peeps happy to dance :(. END
BEGIN NOW Creepers creeping in a way too smokey room, and I'm a smoker. END
BEGIN NOW  Good music and good drinks though. END
BEGIN NOW Great "dive bar"! Wouldn't have known about this place if I wasn't brought here. END
BEGIN NOW  No sign on the outside so you wouldn't think to come in. END
BEGIN NOW   So dark inside. END
BEGIN NOW  There is a smoking lounge (did we go back in time??) But you can stay clear of that and just hang by the bar and the front area, no detection of any smoke so no problem! Drinks are affordable. END
BEGIN NOW  Music is a throwback, but overall a good place to start/end the night!. END
BEGIN NOW  I HATE LABELS. END
BEGIN NOW   I DON’T LIKE HAVING TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO LITTLE BOXES. END
BEGIN NOW   BUT IF YOU HAD TO LABEL ME, I GUESS YOU COULD CALL ME… REAL. END
BEGIN NOW  I WANT TO BE THE SAME AS ALL THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. END
BEGIN NOW  LANA DEL REY IS ONE OF THE BEST MUSICAL EXPONENTS OF HER GENERATION. END

BEGIN NOW  Have you heard their side project?. END
BEGIN NOW  Their single is the worst song on the album. END
BEGIN NOW  This is the most important album of the decade. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend used to date the lead singer. END

BEGIN NOW  My phone died. END

BEGIN NOW  They only take cash. END
BEGIN NOW  I know, right?. END
BEGIN NOW  Totes. END
BEGIN NOW  he would be so much more attractive if he didn't post so many selfies. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm nowhere close to where I thought I'd be at this age. END
BEGIN NOW   What am I doing with my life?. END
BEGIN NOW  Dude, I got so turnt last night!. END
BEGIN NOW  This article doe. END
BEGIN NOW  That party was too turnt!. END
BEGIN NOW  It’s hella hot outside today. END
BEGIN NOW  Karen only wears oversized frockets and leggings. END
BEGIN NOW   She’s hella basic. END
BEGIN NOW  She threw shade at me in front of everyone and thought I wouldn’t realize. END
BEGIN NOW  This song is giving me life! YAS!. END
BEGIN NOW  I totally ship Piper and Alex! My all-time favorite ship is Ross and Rachel. END
BEGIN NOW  Those tacos were good AF. END
BEGIN NOW  Did you see his eyes? He was lit af. END
BEGIN NOW  You always have my back, fam. END
BEGIN NOW  let's do brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  best brunch spot in the city, you can't even get there on the bus. END
BEGIN NOW  i can't, i'm in an uber right now. END
BEGIN NOW  A truly tasty burger requires no secrets; use only fresh ingredients, prepare them to order, and serve it as promptly as possible. END
BEGIN NOW   This one was delivered as promised on a soft Firebrand bun with pungent Point Reyes bleu cheese and sweet caramelized onions. END
BEGIN NOW   I opted for mine to be grilled medium-rare and to be spared the mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  The kitchen at GLK did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW   My goodness was this sandwich delicious! Augmented by perfectly seasoned French fries and an ice cold pint, I relished every bite while dining outside overlooking Lake Merritt, enjoying the company of my girlfriend and strangers that were seated close by who all felt as strongly about their selection of entrees as I did mine. END
BEGIN NOW  They told me that that a total remodeling of the place had just been completed three days ago. END
BEGIN NOW   So I guess I'll just have to come back to check that out at brunch someday soon. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm already looking forward to it already. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm torn because the food was inventive yet pedestrian in execution. END
BEGIN NOW  Eggs Bennie is my fave and go to brunch meal. END
BEGIN NOW   It's the yardstick of a good spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Again,  torn. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW  Innovative- check. END
BEGIN NOW   They replaced the English muffin with rye bread, presumably from Acme, and the fruit with an salad with a nice vinegarette. END
BEGIN NOW    Score!. END
BEGIN NOW  Execution- the eggs came out over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW   They should've never come out of the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   They have just re-opened after a major reno and people are swarming like bees. END
BEGIN NOW   I put this down to the kitchen getting used to the new flow. END
BEGIN NOW  Staff- totally saved their bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   Really. END
BEGIN NOW    The hostess is very gracious and adept at empathizing with customers. END
BEGIN NOW   It takes a special person to get people excited for an hour wait by sending them to the farmers market and making it convenient to check in. END
BEGIN NOW    I sat in essentially the serve area for the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender made it the best seat in the house. END
BEGIN NOW   She is very thorough and attentive in her job. END
BEGIN NOW   Her mimosa was delish. END
BEGIN NOW  Trouble is the crowd and a need to turn tables. END
BEGIN NOW   Brunch is supposed to be, or at least feel, leisurely. END
BEGIN NOW   It was fun but I can see myself relaxing there. END
BEGIN NOW  I absolutely love this spot. END
BEGIN NOW  I was looking for a good brunch place not in SF and found Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   The restaurant is pretty damn small but if you can ge. END
BEGIN NOW  t there at a good time, the wait isn't terrible. END
BEGIN NOW   It's also nice that the lake is right outside so you can just hang out if the weather permits. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend and I ordered the Savory French Toast and the Pork Belly Hash. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't rteally remember the hash, because the savory french toast was SO FREAKING GOOD. END
BEGIN NOW   The flavor combos here just worked so well. END
BEGIN NOW   So well, in fact, that I ate here a little over a year ago and I'm just now writing the review. END
BEGIN NOW  I was also recently introduced to chilaquiles, which I see is on the menu here, so I'm making it a goal to return sometime soon!. END
BEGIN NOW  No wait at dinner time. END
BEGIN NOW    Thoughtful food prepared with love and care. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice breeze on the patio and lovely alcoholic and nonalcoholic drink options. END
BEGIN NOW    I will be back for brunch to see if it can live up to the hype and long lines. END
BEGIN NOW  This is by far in my top three places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW    I've usually just picked up a sandwhich, but I went for breakfast and has just a full on delicious meal. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a little chilly, but they provided blankets, which actually made the experience a little more fun. END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee is just right. END
BEGIN NOW    I got the soft scrambled eggs and it was just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    My dad got the oyako egg salad open faced on rye and the eggs had such a different flavor and texture but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  I just love the flavors here. END
BEGIN NOW    The portions are perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    And I absolutely loved the staff. END
BEGIN NOW    Whatever they're doing just keep doing it. END
BEGIN NOW    Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW  30 minute wait for brunch on a Monday? Must be that good, eh it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW   Came here for my birthday with a few friends, and we all shared what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD: I had the chilaquiles since it was highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW   Personally, I didn't like how soggy the chips were and the salsa lacked flavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Out of the two dishes my friends ordered, oyaka and savory French toast, the savory French toast stood out for its unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   There is actually no French toast involved, just toasted rye bread for the base, topped with arugula and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   The oyaka was an open faced egg salad sandwich topped with chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend liked it, and I thought it just okay. END
BEGIN NOW   But honesty, it's hard to mess up an egg salad. END
BEGIN NOW  DRINKS: We shared a pitcher of POG mimosas, which were perfect for the hot weather. END
BEGIN NOW  OVERALL: I might come back to try out other things on the menu, but will stay away from the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  What a lovely spot. END
BEGIN NOW   My beau and I went here on our last day in California, and to check out the spot as the friend we visited is the manager. END
BEGIN NOW   Most of the seating is outside (until the expansion is completed) but it was a nice enough day so we plopped down and ordered. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the strawberry French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   My boo had the eggs Benedict with toast, a side of greens and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   Our meal was so amazing!! Some of the best eggs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW   They were light and fluffy yet moist and cheesy without being over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW   The French toast was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Lightly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Fresh strawberries, whip cream and yummy maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW  It hasn't even been a month since our visit and I already miss the food. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're in the Oakland area, do your mouth a favor and swing by this spot. END
BEGIN NOW  4. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm falling more and more in love with Oakland each time I visit, especially this area around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   Such gorgeous views with hip things to do, like brunch! I randomly searched for brunch places around here, and Grand Lake Kitchen was first on the list. END
BEGIN NOW   My boyfriend and I put our names on the list, took a brief walk around Lake Merritt, then came back just in time for our names to be called. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated on the outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a warm Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect for brunch outside. END
BEGIN NOW   What a lively vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Much different from having brunch in San Francisco, I'd say. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the Pastrami Benedict which was served on rye bread. END
BEGIN NOW   so unique and tasty! Lots of cool things on the menu, whether brunch, lunch, or snacks. END
BEGIN NOW   My boyfriend got the Pork Belly Hash which did not look as appealing as the Pastrami Benedict but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Inside the actual restaurant seems more narrow, but you get to see the chefs work their magic, which is pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall it's definitely worth the trek to Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   They have an excellent selection of meats that you can't miss!. END
BEGIN NOW  Got here around 11 and didn't get seated until 11:45. END
BEGIN NOW   Be prepared for that wait!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is tiny! But the food is great and the Bellinis are pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the savory French toast and would recommend adding the prosciutto as I went without and kind of felt it was lacking. END
BEGIN NOW   I did love that the savory French toast had arugella and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW   Yuuuuum! Plus poached eggs were cooked well. END
BEGIN NOW   One was slightly over done but didn't affect the dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW  Friend ordered the soft scramble and it looked. END
BEGIN NOW   basic but tasted pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Although a tiny spot along Lake Merritt, Grand Lake Kitchen is truly a gem! I stopped in for a late breakfast/brunch and I would highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW   Although it's tempting to sit inside at the counter and watch the chefs work their magic, the umbrellaed outdoor patio gives a beautiful (although a touch away) view of beautiful Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   Although we visited on a Monday late morning (note: they're closed all day Tuesdays!), there was a steady stream of people waiting for tables throughout our visit. END
BEGIN NOW  We started with a bottled rose lemonade (although it isn't made in house, I always order a Fentimans soda when available) and a hibiscus cleanse (more sour than I expected but different in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW   From there we ordered the dungeness crab appetizer, served on toasted bread with avocado and topped with fresh greens. END
BEGIN NOW   This was truly a spectacular dish, the crab was amazing and the flavors combined perfectly and were crisp and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect appetizer to split between two people. END
BEGIN NOW   For our main course we ordered the Italian sandwich, which they cut in the kitchen for us and served on two plates, a nice touch, with a pickled vegetable on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   The ACME bread that it was served on (as most of the sandwiches are served on) is spectacular, sandwiches delicious meats, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   You will not be disappointed with this pick from the menu!. END
BEGIN NOW  Grand Lake Kitchen is a restaurant that, if I lived in the area, I would return to over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and I've heard from others positive things about so many dishes. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a place where it'd be easy to explore the menu and always want to order something new. END
BEGIN NOW   They also sell a variety of specialty products in the restaurant, including Durham, NC made Big Spoon peanut butter (shout out to my home city!) One note: they don't accept American Express here. END
BEGIN NOW  This is my favorite brunch spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   You have to get there early though, there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   I think the wait is worth it! The front patio is great too, it's right across from lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   I love the pastrami eggs Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW   The pellinis are super good too! Even if it's cold out, sit on the front prior. END
BEGIN NOW   They will give you blankets to keep warm. END
BEGIN NOW  Cheers to Yelp again for helping me find a delicious brunch place. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf's favorite meal of the day is brunch so off we go searching for one when I found this place. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm assuming they're expanding since there's construction going on next door. END
BEGIN NOW   Great if they are!. END
BEGIN NOW  Seatings are limited but we went on a weekday so snagged a table right away. END
BEGIN NOW   Love their outdoor seating area that is across from Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   Great place for a full belly then cross the street to walk it off. END
BEGIN NOW  We order the Savory French Toast and Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW   Great house coffee. END
BEGIN NOW   Would have been nice if they came by to check on us and refill it without asking. END
BEGIN NOW  but waitress was a sweetheart so all good. END
BEGIN NOW  SFT was delicious! I failed to add on prosciutto and it was still rich with flavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Wouldn't think that of just toast, eggs, arugula and cheese but the combination with the herb oil and sauté wild mushrooms made it a worth-order dish!. END
BEGIN NOW  Now to the Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  I love Mexican food but can't bring myself to like it for breakfast/brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   It's my personal taste so don't take my word for it. END
BEGIN NOW   BF thought it was good but not exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe. END
BEGIN NOW  only maybe if they give you an option to add carne asada or al pastor. END
BEGIN NOW  now that would be my type of a brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW  Short and sweet:. END
BEGIN NOW  "Deli-style" old-school restaurant feel. END
BEGIN NOW   The food was everything I've heard about it being. END
BEGIN NOW   We had the savory French toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't be scared, homie. END
BEGIN NOW   It was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been hearing about it for months. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything it was supposed to be. END
BEGIN NOW  Friendly, attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW  With a beautiful view situated right across Lake Merritt, this place is in a perfect spot to sit back on a Sunday morning and eat some delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a 20 minute wait and none of us minded when they handed us some mimosas and coffee so that we could sit in their outside patio soaking up some sun. END
BEGIN NOW    Lucky for us, the weather was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   Warm enough to take off our jackets and grey blankets draped on the chairs in case we got chilly. END
BEGIN NOW  Let's get to the most important part of this experience and talk about the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Because that's what we care about the most right?  Here you go folks, straight from the menu right to you. END
BEGIN NOW  *CRAB TOAST - DUNGENESS CRAB, AVOCADO, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPER VINAIGRETTE, SOURDOUGH 14. END
BEGIN NOW  00. END
BEGIN NOW    Yessss. END
BEGIN NOW   Generous portion of crab meat, salad greens and perfectly toasted sourdough. END
BEGIN NOW    Couldn't get enough of this stuff. END
BEGIN NOW    It was so good that had they given us a bigger portion, I would have kept stuffing my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW    Not cute. END
BEGIN NOW  *CHILAQUILES - TORTILLA CHIPS, SALSA ROJA, BLACK BEANS, 2 EGGS SUNNY, AVOCADO, QUESO FRESCO, SOUR CREAM, PICKLED RED ONIONS 12. END
BEGIN NOW  00  I'm going to be in the minority and say that I wasn't impressed with this. END
BEGIN NOW    The red sauce was bland and nothing about this stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW    Wouldn't order it again. END
BEGIN NOW  *SAVORY FRENCH TOAST - RYE BREAD IN PORCINI BATTER, 2 POACHED EGGS, WILD MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, ARUGULA, HERB OIL 13. END
BEGIN NOW  00  Savory French Toast?  Talk about first time for everything. END
BEGIN NOW    I was glad I got to pop this cherry because boy oh boy. END
BEGIN NOW    This was good. END
BEGIN NOW    The french toast itself was slightly crunchy on the outside, seasoned with a pinch of salt. END
BEGIN NOW   The rest of the ingredients were the perfect accompaniment. END
BEGIN NOW    Pancetta on top gave it a nice salty kick and we practically inhaled this entire plate. END
BEGIN NOW  I have to add in that their bathroom was immaculate. END
BEGIN NOW    If you've read my other reviews, you know how much I appreciate a clean toilet bowl. END
BEGIN NOW    Good job Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW    You have impressed me. END
BEGIN NOW  perfect for wkend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are the best. END
BEGIN NOW    we always come here for these. END
BEGIN NOW  we've tried some benedicts. END
BEGIN NOW  and it was good too but Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are something really special about this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW  all servers are super nice!!! Thank that I can start my wkend morning pleasantly w these great food and awesome servers. END
BEGIN NOW  THEY ARE BACK AND THEY BETTA!. END
BEGIN NOW  Bigger inside more seating with a bar! Same amazing customer service and delicious food! Love this place so much I always leave happy and stuffed. END
BEGIN NOW  People who have read my reviews know that breakfast/brunch is my least favorite meal to eat out. END
BEGIN NOW   Mainly because I'm always underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW   I've yet to find an amazing brunch in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW  Grand Lake Kitchen has been on my list to try though due to the great reviews and alluring photos. END
BEGIN NOW   Since me and the BF were free on a Thursday morning, I decided to give it a try!. END
BEGIN NOW  There was no wait, but we decided to sit outside since it was nice and cool. END
BEGIN NOW   They gave us blankets to keep warm, which I thought was a nice touch!. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the chilaquiles and the savory french toast. END
BEGIN NOW   It was my first time having chilaquiles and I wasn't that impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Soggy chips, coquita cheese and unseasoned black beans. END
BEGIN NOW   The scrambled eggs were soft but lackluster on their own. END
BEGIN NOW    Ample amount of avocado! I felt like everything was on the bland side and I needed to use salt on everything (which I usually never do). END
BEGIN NOW   The savory french toast was interesting and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the mushrooms! But I found the huge amount of arugula to be a bit much. END
BEGIN NOW   Portions were decent size. END
BEGIN NOW   However, it wasn't a WOW dish for me either. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall, I found both dishes to be just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was really friendly and attentive though, checking up on use to make sure we were good since we were the only ones sitting outside. END
BEGIN NOW  The search continues. END
BEGIN NOW  Extremely cute brunch & lunch place in Oakland near Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   This spot is kind of small and crammed, but the food is fresh and not too greasy. END
BEGIN NOW   My partner and I split the breakfast sandwich and ordered a side salad with roasted chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   The breakfast sandwich was delicious and I especially loved the acme bread it was on. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread was soft and not too hard and it blended well with the eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   We decided to substitute the ham for bacon at a $1 extra as I am not a fan of ham. END
BEGIN NOW   The salad was pretty good too and the dressing had a mustard vinaigrette dressing. END
BEGIN NOW  I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try the pork belly hash which is only served on the weekends so I will definitely need to be back when I'm in the Bay Area again. END
BEGIN NOW   They also sell chips, spreads, bread and some other groceries on a shelf near the entrance. END
BEGIN NOW  Grand Lake Kitchen is/was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I have no complaints about the food or the service. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I don't think it warrants the rating it has on here. END
BEGIN NOW  I had one of their recommended sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good, but it was nothing to write home about. END
BEGIN NOW   If you decide to eat here, the portions can be small, so you may have to order side dishes. END
BEGIN NOW  There are a couple of things I have on repeat at this joint. END
BEGIN NOW  Because they don't have a ton of veggie options. END
BEGIN NOW  French toast with oven-toasted blackberries? Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW  Huevos rancheros? Good but not Mexican enough (calm down, I'm Mexican, so I have license to say that). END
BEGIN NOW  Red potato salad? Good. END
BEGIN NOW  Obama sammie? Great:). END
BEGIN NOW  Usually love brunching at Oakland Grill around the corner; in fact it's my fave spot in Oakland to brunch hands down but decided to try something different so we tried out Chop Bar instead. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered the pork belly hash, it was absolutely delish, hats off to the chefs. END
BEGIN NOW   Also ordered mimosas, it was meh. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend wasnt impressed with this place however the ambience more then made up for it. END
BEGIN NOW   The interior had a beautiful layout woodsy country theme with a modern twist. END
BEGIN NOW   Decided to try the outdoor sitting, just perfect for a summer day. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice cool breeze and the opportunity to people watch :). END
BEGIN NOW  2 stars for the servers, they were not friendly, lacked enthusiasm but I didn't let that ruin my vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Check out this spot when you're in the area!. END
BEGIN NOW  Decent place for weekend brunch in a casual, relaxed setting. END
BEGIN NOW  I opted for the eggs Benedict, which was pretty good - the Hollandaise sauce was nice and smooth and the eggs were cooked perfectly, although the English muffin was a bit tough. END
BEGIN NOW   I also enjoyed the Bloody Mary with bacon, which had a good combination of saltiness and spice. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is not the most engaging, but adequate for the prices. END
BEGIN NOW  Friendly service, chic-industrial interior, so-so brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork belly hash left something to be desired. END
BEGIN NOW   so says mi amigo. END
BEGIN NOW  And the Eggs ala Cazuela with Veggie Mojo? Well, first let me translate that for non espanol speakers- eggs baked in roasted tomato-pepper sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Now for my review of that dish. END
BEGIN NOW   En espanol- Es ok. END
BEGIN NOW   In English- It's okay. END
BEGIN NOW  Two eggs swimming in tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   Soak up the sun (of sauce) with roasted potatoes and 2 small slices of acme bread. END
BEGIN NOW   I feel a side salad or some greenery would've spruced things up- evened out that sauce, carbs, and eggs dynamic. END
BEGIN NOW   Hello, Salt. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW  The laid-back vibe and open window seating creates an enjoyable atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   Close to Jack London square (not near the water but in the warehouse area), Chop Bar is a 10 minute walk from the Lake Merritt bart stop. END
BEGIN NOW   I hear their oxtail poutine fries are good, so I'd get that if I came another time. END
BEGIN NOW   Seems like a fun place for a happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been here twice and I have yet to eat anything that I would reorder. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks, however, are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The bacon bloody Mary is tangy, spicy, sweet and robust. END
BEGIN NOW   Do yourself a favor and get a group together for brunch and order the Bacon Bloody Mary. END
BEGIN NOW   Your taste buds will appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW  isited on Valentine's Day!. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't too busy yet since we came early. END
BEGIN NOW   Food was aiiittteee. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the polenta and mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW   Mimosa was good. END
BEGIN NOW   Polenta was fine. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a cute place f'sho. END
BEGIN NOW  The cute table gave my sweater dress a splinter. END
BEGIN NOW   Good thing it didn't puncture through my dress. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing else on the menu stood out to me so I probably won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW  It'a located in good ol' Jack London square. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice location good for dates. END
BEGIN NOW   Walk around and catch the farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW   Or catch whatever is going on at Jack London square! They have Jack of all trades. END
BEGIN NOW   Movies in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW   The list goes on. END
BEGIN NOW  Great food at reasonable prices. END
BEGIN NOW   Taken out of town guests here twice and everyone has commented on the excellent quality of the food. END
BEGIN NOW  Food - fantastic! I've tried or sampled: pork banh mi, mussels, chicken torta, the chop burger, Ruben, and fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW   All were flawless and would order each item again. END
BEGIN NOW   I would give special attention to the broth with the mussels and ask for extra bread; you don't want to let that broth go to waste. END
BEGIN NOW  Drinks- again fantastic! I've tried the Bloody Mary with and without Bacon - highly recommend either as they tickle all different flavor areas on your tongue. END
BEGIN NOW    Also had a Spicy Q, drink with rum and jalapeño, would order on the rocks next time but delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Service - first visit was absolutely amazing - server was a mind reader - on it for drink orders and brought extra bread for the mussels without us even asking. END
BEGIN NOW    I tipped 30% in appreciation. END
BEGIN NOW  Second visit was sub-par. END
BEGIN NOW   I just felt like the server didn't want to be there and didn't ask if we wanted a second round of drinks when we were low. END
BEGIN NOW   Ended up not ordering more drinks because we finished our food. END
BEGIN NOW   Also asked how was the food while facing another table and not making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW   Head wasn't in the game. END
BEGIN NOW   Essentially barely checking on us after the food came out. END
BEGIN NOW   I was server for 4 years, we all have those off days (or hangovers), I get it. END
BEGIN NOW  Atmosphere - really love the bar and wood elements inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Pig pictures on the walls and pig toilet paper holder in bathroom is a funny touch. END
BEGIN NOW   Saw a TV but it was not on during lunch hours for either visit. END
BEGIN NOW  not sure if that was intentional or not but it created more of a conversational experience at my table with dudes who would have normally zoned out to sportscenter. END
BEGIN NOW   Didn't bother me either way, just felt it should be noted. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall - 4 Stars - would give them a 5 except for service on second visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect ratings are reserved for perfect restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW  Pastrami Potato Hash was well seasoned, poached eggs were done perfectly and the potatoes were solid. END
BEGIN NOW  The frittata was a unique twist on the classic. END
BEGIN NOW   There's was thinner with a crispy bottom vs traditional ones that is thicker and more reminiscent of a pie. END
BEGIN NOW  The variety is good but not the best for vegetarians especially during brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Expect to wait especially during peak times. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall Thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW  I am glad I got a chance to try Chop Bar and more grateful that I didn't leave disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  Not going to lie, one of the best parts of Chop Bar is that you can call 30 min in advance and put your name down for a table. END
BEGIN NOW   I was on Bart when I called and upon arrival a table was waiting for us! A few other groups were waiting outside for brunch but we just sat right down. END
BEGIN NOW   (if only SF places were like this. END
BEGIN NOW  ). END
BEGIN NOW  Walking up, we saw some people with the bloody marys and they looked incredible! I personally don't like bloody marys but my friend said it wasn't quite as spicy as she would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW   The pickled veggies and the bacon that come with it were delicious though!. END
BEGIN NOW  I got the french toast with apples and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW   The toast was pretty fluffy and thoroughly soaked in syrup. END
BEGIN NOW   In fact, the toast was in a pool of syrup so the last few bites were a bit too soggy. END
BEGIN NOW   I also wished there had been more apples and walnuts because that would have added more texture to the dish. END
BEGIN NOW  Chop Bar is a great spot for brunch and lunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch: 4 stars, Lunch: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Dinner: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  Although the brunch menu may look like your typical brunch, they really do a great job. END
BEGIN NOW   The quality of ingredients and the flavors are on point. END
BEGIN NOW   The chilaquiles and french toast are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Lunch is also good too but the few times I've been I wasn't too impressed with their menu. END
BEGIN NOW   One item I really enjoyed was their clams. END
BEGIN NOW   My mom had the pork banh-mi and I wasn't too impressed when I tried it. END
BEGIN NOW   It was expensive and made with great quality ingredients I'm sure, but it didn't beat a $4 banh mi I could get in chinatown. END
BEGIN NOW   I also tried the oxtail poutine which was a little too saucy and it needed either more fries or bread on the side to dip into it. END
BEGIN NOW   Delicious but I couldn't just slurp the gravy on its own. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all, the service is great and there is a great amount of parking near by. END
BEGIN NOW   The ambiance is nice with indoor and outdoor seating. END
BEGIN NOW   The last time I went Festus Ezeli from the warriors was sitting near me. END
BEGIN NOW   I was pretty star struck and decided not to disturb him, but that was a cool memory of this place! (:. END
BEGIN NOW  Wanted to try the Bloody Mary ($8) at this place since I heard it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I had never had one before, so I figured I might as well start with a good one. END
BEGIN NOW   Needless to say, I don't think I'm the Bloody Mary type. END
BEGIN NOW   It had a nice flavor, but it's too spicy and more like a meal in a glass (I'm also not a fan of milkshakes with my food). END
BEGIN NOW   I do recommend getting it with bacon ($2 extra), as it's some of the best I've had. END
BEGIN NOW  The food came to us oddly quick. END
BEGIN NOW   Within minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the asparagus appetizer ($11). END
BEGIN NOW   It came with a poached egg and some sort of green sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   Flavor was nice, but it was a little salty. END
BEGIN NOW   Not too salty, just a little. END
BEGIN NOW  I got the Chop Bar Burger for my meal ($14) with Swiss cheese ($1 extra, but some add-ons were $2 extra). END
BEGIN NOW   Meat-wise, the burger was top notch. END
BEGIN NOW   And I liked the bun, too. END
BEGIN NOW   Other than that, there weren't a whole lot of other flavors going on. END
BEGIN NOW   Just the bacon, which merely added to the saltiness of the patty. END
BEGIN NOW   The Swiss cheese and the aioli were non-existent. END
BEGIN NOW   I even asked for more aioli for extra taste. END
BEGIN NOW   It only barely helped. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't a bad burger by any means. END
BEGIN NOW   It was just too reliant on the bold meat flavor and needed a little more craft. END
BEGIN NOW  My dad got the pork confit ($20) with a side of Jo-Jos ($6), which are basically potato wedges. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork was very flavorful, and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  They specialize in meat, and they passed with flying colors in that department. END
BEGIN NOW   It's just that they tend to add a lot of ingredients that merely sound good on paper without truly complimenting each other. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, this place is a tad bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW   $8 for the Bloody Mary isn't bad, but the food is just too expensive for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW   I've had better for less. END
BEGIN NOW  But most importantly, this place was good enough to make me want to come back to try their other menu items. END
BEGIN NOW  We heard the meatloaf was good, but I guess we'll save that for next time. END
BEGIN NOW  Try ordering ANYTHING off the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   These guys have ZERO interest in giving a customer a satisfying experience. END
BEGIN NOW   I feel bad because the chefs are working hard trying to make amazing food and it's being served by these indifferent "hipster barrista" types. END
BEGIN NOW  Damn disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  Sunday brunch was most excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   We were seated fairly quickly. END
BEGIN NOW   The staff was incredibly attentive and nice. END
BEGIN NOW   All smiles!. END
BEGIN NOW  The French toast is a big win. END
BEGIN NOW   Custard-dipped brioche with candied walnuts, apples and whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW   It was to die for. END
BEGIN NOW  Other big wins was the chiliquiles with chorizo and salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW   A really big portion. END
BEGIN NOW  The side of bacon was meh. END
BEGIN NOW   It was actually one slice of bacon cut in three chunks. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't particularly tasty and $5 which was a bit of a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee was most excellent and local. END
BEGIN NOW  Will definitely visit this place again. END
BEGIN NOW  I love that this place lets you call ahead for brunch to put your name down on the list. END
BEGIN NOW   I cannot appreciate that enough. END
BEGIN NOW   I oftentimes will avoid brunch in SF because I don't want to wait over an hour after I get there just to get seated. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried the bloody mary "baconized". END
BEGIN NOW   I saw other people with the bloody mary as we walked in and decided right then that I had to get it. END
BEGIN NOW   It looked like a pretty standard bloody mary, but with bacon on top (I know, right?!)!! Not sure how much I actually liked the bacon in it, but it was definitely an interesting twist. END
BEGIN NOW   The bloody mary itself was decent, a little on the tomato-y side, not super spicy. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu is not super extensive, but has your standard brunch options. END
BEGIN NOW   Between me and my friends, we ordered a few different things. END
BEGIN NOW  1) Pastrami hash (with poached eggs) - I had this, it was pretty tasty, nothing particularly special about it, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I enjoyed it, though it was more like chunks of pastrami and potato, rather than a hash really. END
BEGIN NOW  2) Pork belly frittata - The pork belly in the frittata looked like it had a good fat to lean ratio (which is important!) but wasn't seasoned quite enough. END
BEGIN NOW  3) Eggs cazuela. END
BEGIN NOW  4) French toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Chop Bar is the good Oakland, the kind you want to show off to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW  It's located in a cool loft space in Jack London, within walking distance from the Blue Bottle flagship location. END
BEGIN NOW   The wait on a Sunday afternoon teeters around 20 mins, which isn't all that bad in comparison to some spots in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu features all kinds of new American and California inspired plates. END
BEGIN NOW   Their burger is a serious force to be reckoned with. END
BEGIN NOW   This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW   Let me lay this out for you. END
BEGIN NOW   the bun is somewhere between sourdough and a pastry. END
BEGIN NOW   It is remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW   The hamburger patty is so thick and so juicy and as you eat this thing, the juices dribble out and the soft part of the bun soaks it up. END
BEGIN NOW   Thick, hickory smoked slices of bacon and avocado adorn this creation. END
BEGIN NOW   Make sure to add cheese too because, holy crap, the melted swiss cheese on this thing was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   I asked for medium rare and received a very well done patty, but I was too hungry to do anything about it. END
BEGIN NOW   Kind of a bummer, so make sure your waiter knows you're not playing around. END
BEGIN NOW  They only have 4 beers on tap, none of which is a pilsner, and all their taps were broken when I went. END
BEGIN NOW   Basically their only downfall is being a beer buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel like Chop Bar can do no wrong. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had dinner here twice, and stopped in one time for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW    While it can get kind of loud in this small, intimate space, you'll probably be too busy savoring the amazing food to want to talk to whoever else you're with. END
BEGIN NOW    Just keeping it 100. END
BEGIN NOW  Their agua frescas ($3) are, well, refreshing. END
BEGIN NOW    If you want something other than water, but that won't drive your BAC up, this is a great choice. END
BEGIN NOW    I had a watermelon one for dinner and it had the faintest hint of lime in it, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Even with the striking blend of flavors, I think it blended pretty well with the pork chop I ordered that evening. END
BEGIN NOW  For lunch, I opted for their pork Bolognese with pac mac noodles by Baia Pasta (shop. END
BEGIN NOW  baiapasta. END
BEGIN NOW  com/produ…) - $18. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're not in the mood for meat, there's also a seasonal vegetable option, too. END
BEGIN NOW    With a generous portion of shaved parmesan on top, this dish really hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Just the right ratio of noodles to sauce, with plenty of chunks of savory ground pork. END
BEGIN NOW  The first time I had dinner here, I went for the oxtail poutine - $20 (french fries, oxtail gravy, Fiscalini cheddar). END
BEGIN NOW    I might or might not have licked the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW  The second time I went for dinner, I ordered the pork chop and chose kale and mashed potatoes as my side dishes (you also have the option of going with their mac and cheese) - $24. END
BEGIN NOW    Their mashed potatoes were just too good. END
BEGIN NOW    I honestly want to ask them to double up on the mashed potatoes next time. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe i'll just beg for a bowl as my entree. END
BEGIN NOW    The kale was cooked perfectly with onions and garlic, too, and I definitely felt less guilty eating them. END
BEGIN NOW   but the mashed potatoes!!!  As for the pork chop, goodness. END
BEGIN NOW    There was a slight crust that formed all around while the interior remained tender and moist. END
BEGIN NOW    It came in a pool of gravy that complimented it nicely, too, not salty or gelatinous as some gravies can be. END
BEGIN NOW  I would definitely be proud to show this gem of a gastropub to friends and family. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe next time I'll try some appetizers and desserts, too. END
BEGIN NOW  We came here for brunch on Mother's Day , we called about 30 mins ahead and was seated almost right away. END
BEGIN NOW   The food arrived quickly and the server was great. END
BEGIN NOW   We got the pork hash , the eggs Benedict and eggs Benedict with crab and the torta. END
BEGIN NOW   All the food was perfect and cooked wonderfully. END
BEGIN NOW   The torta was almost like a banh mi fusion but I'm not complaining , I probably wouldn't call it a torta but it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   The crab eggs Benedict tasted amazing , they were really generous with the crab and came with a generous side of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Of course I can't forget about the hot sauce , they had cholula and a house made sauce that was really smokey and delicious but pretty spicy. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't wait to come back again. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is eehhhh. END
BEGIN NOW   The price we paid was definitely not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW   2 entrees and a coffee and orange juice cost us about $40! The French toast was so soggy. END
BEGIN NOW   My husband ordered the pork belly hash. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't even pork belly more like small tiny pieces of bacon and there's no hash! It was just home style potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW   Go over by lake Merritt for way better brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW  come to Portal's Queer Beer Wednesday every week! The sliders on the happy hour menu are my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW  UPDATE: I have been coming to every QBW for over a year! The fried chicken sliders are a welcome addition to the before 5:00 "happy (hour) meal" menu, and I'm not sorry to see the cheese sauce go from the fries either. END
BEGIN NOW   Portal's rotating menu of craft beers has taught me a lot about beer and about my taste too. END
BEGIN NOW   Ask for Melvin. END
BEGIN NOW   He's the best!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is pretty neat. END
BEGIN NOW   I came in for lunch on a beautiful afternoon and sat on the outdoor patio overlooking the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a large party of 12 requiring the attn of most of the wait staff (3 servers). END
BEGIN NOW   Service was very slow from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW   Not a place for a quick bite or lunch if you're on the clock. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was very good. END
BEGIN NOW   Quality ingredients and large portions. END
BEGIN NOW   I went with the Garlic bread meatball sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW   The mini burgers and chilaquiles looked good and I hope to come back for those. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall a good spot, but service was shoddy -- no refills or checkups. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for dinner with a few friends. END
BEGIN NOW    We shared the vegetarian garbage bread, which was quite delish. END
BEGIN NOW    The garbage bread was very hearty, and it definitely did not need meat. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW    For myself, I ordered 2 mini burgers in fried chicken and turkey, both were quite filling and tasty, though not as exciting as our garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall the atmosphere was a nice small pub, great for a couple of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    The outside area is also very cute, definitely want to return for brunch with mimosas!  Will update my review upon return!. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm completely in love with this place. END
BEGIN NOW   The food, the people, the beer, and seating!! Very close to the lake with outdoor seating (there's indoor seating as well). END
BEGIN NOW   They have 3 tvs inside, and one shared bathroom (the only drawback). END
BEGIN NOW  I love the beer selection here, only problem I have is that there's a high turn over of the beer. END
BEGIN NOW   As soon as you fall in love with one there's one to replace it. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is great, try the cheese knots. END
BEGIN NOW   They're basically like homemade mozzarella sticks and they will change your life on how you see mozzarella sticks. END
BEGIN NOW   The wings are great as well. END
BEGIN NOW   Not bad prices. END
BEGIN NOW  There's parking all around. END
BEGIN NOW   When you sit outside you have views of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   Very nice decor both indoor and outdoor. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW   They do have vegan and veg options!. END
BEGIN NOW  It is definitely worth the (honestly not bad) wait for a table on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW   I was so relaxed with a beer and good food, staring out at the breezy lake. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank God out of their decently-sized list of beers on tap, there was at least one sour. END
BEGIN NOW   We just barely missed bottomless mimosas (I believe they're done at 1 pm?), damn. END
BEGIN NOW  We shared the pork belly salad and garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW   If it sounds like we were eating light, we absolutely were not. END
BEGIN NOW   The garbage bread sneaks up on you, and all the fixings inside are going to make you groan after it settles in twenty or so minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   Delicious in the moment, though. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork belly salad was average, and a bit overdressed/salty. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking was fortunately easy to find all around, and seriously, thank God for the location. END
BEGIN NOW   We had to walk it off for an hour around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal is like. END
BEGIN NOW  one of those places where you stumble across on accident. END
BEGIN NOW   But at the end of the day you realize the encounter was supposed to happen. END
BEGIN NOW   Some may even say "divine intervention" well at least for those into bar food with a light sophisticated twist. END
BEGIN NOW   And those that like local beers, hoppy ales, and micro brews. END
BEGIN NOW   And a nice view of Lake Merrit from the patio. END
BEGIN NOW   So far Portal has a few things right. END
BEGIN NOW   Allow me to tell you a little more. END
BEGIN NOW   Here is my review of Portal. END
BEGIN NOW  4/21/16. END
BEGIN NOW  My constant Yelping seems to have rubbed on aome of my friends! I decided to stay and take in Oakland after going to my guard card class earlier on in the day. END
BEGIN NOW   I had booked marked so many places in Oakland and didn't think I was going to get to visit any of them until my buddy contacted me after seeing me check in on "Facebook" in the "City of Oakland" he was like "Yo dude you in my hood, I been checking out some cool gastropubs on Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW   Let's check out this place called Portal!" I was stoked because I one didn't know my homie "Yelped" and two because I didn't realize I had bookedmarked it already. END
BEGIN NOW   So I was totally down. END
BEGIN NOW   He swooped me up and we set off. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice to see a few places I've bookedmarked in Oakland as we drove throughout downtown and the Lake Merrit area. END
BEGIN NOW   But our minds were set, we wanted to step this "Portal" and have some good beer and bar fair. END
BEGIN NOW   It was nice to see Lake Merrit as kinda the. END
BEGIN NOW  "Landmark" if you were trying to find this place and another east bay restarunt that's creating a buzz (rockin crawfish oakland) which is like. END
BEGIN NOW  across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   But back to the reason for this review. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal!. END
BEGIN NOW  Service - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW  Food - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW  Beer 100/5 :D. END
BEGIN NOW  The Warriors played this day so this place went from like empty to packed house in like a 10 min span. END
BEGIN NOW   Not to mention my NY Yankees were playing as well so. END
BEGIN NOW  I was indeed having a great day. END
BEGIN NOW   My homie and I started with some 805's (beer) with bbq and hot wings for starters. END
BEGIN NOW   Of you've had 805 before, its a pretty good light beer made here in cali, it really compliments light foods in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW   The wings were prefect! Fried just right, the sauces were just enough and not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus the prices were pretty good on the food and beer here as well (see my my pics for prices and menu shots!) oh. END
BEGIN NOW  and if you get a pitcher of the "Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme 11% abv" be prepared to take a "Uber or Lyft" home :D. END
BEGIN NOW  Will I go back?. END
BEGIN NOW  In a heartbeat!. END
BEGIN NOW  In conclusion, this place is perfect for hanging out, happy hour, dates, shenanigans and just chillaxing. END
BEGIN NOW   And with the Patio, I'm sure the ambiance at night is just pretty ill with Lake Merrit as the backdrop. END
BEGIN NOW   I say if you've bookedmarked this place before, I would say give it a go! You will like it here! Of not. END
BEGIN NOW  you just hard to please! :D As always yelp your own experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland you have a winner! My first time at this place & I loved everything about this hipster spot. END
BEGIN NOW  We got there right at 10am when they opened. END
BEGIN NOW   I can see where the wait can be a little long especially if you want to sit on the patio (which has a gorgeous view of Lake Merit). END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone at the table had a little bit of everything. END
BEGIN NOW   The Migas, The Drunk Bread, Guacamole, French Toast. END
BEGIN NOW   We loved all the food. END
BEGIN NOW   I will definitely be back next time I am in town. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  cannot forget the bottomless Mimosas!. END
BEGIN NOW  On the outskirts of Lake Merrit, you will find that this little pub/beer garden pleasantly awaits you. END
BEGIN NOW   You really can't beat Portal's back patio. END
BEGIN NOW   Especially because, the inside of Portal isn't huge - think a few tables and a bar. END
BEGIN NOW   That back patio, tho. END
BEGIN NOW   Communal seating - so, think beer garden steez. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been a few times at wonky hours, think 3:30 looking for brunch and sadly, they stick to dining hours for food, although you can always order drinks and items like fries and such. END
BEGIN NOW   Another huge pro about Portal is their beer list. END
BEGIN NOW   Craft beer aficionnados, you will not be disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had their bloody mary and it's good, not the best, but real solid. END
BEGIN NOW   As always, more accoutrements, please. END
BEGIN NOW   And to my surprise, no vodka in this bad boy, soju only. END
BEGIN NOW   Just an fyi if you happen to be a BM purist. END
BEGIN NOW   They do offer some bottomless mimosa deals during weekend brunch hours, but you'll have to go inquire about prices. END
BEGIN NOW  Most recently for lunch, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my cobb salad and the surprise happy ending. END
BEGIN NOW   No, not that one, ya scumbags. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a delicious, almost pizza like dough that serves as the bottom layer of the salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Score. END
BEGIN NOW   A pretty hefty salad that isn't cheap at $14, but quite filling and freshly filled with juicy chicken, crisp bacon, eggs and so on; pretty much the most unhealthy salad on earth. END
BEGIN NOW   Yep, that's me. END
BEGIN NOW   Other items that piqued my fancy: the burger, the garbage bread, the meatball sub and those fries looked mighty fine. END
BEGIN NOW  Go. END
BEGIN NOW   Drink beer. END
BEGIN NOW   Enjoy that Oakland sunshine and eat!. END
BEGIN NOW  I've  not been in awhile they've been pretty busy which is awesome for them, so I went in today and it's just gotten soo casual in service to a point of rude. END
BEGIN NOW  The glass was dirty and the server was poignantly rude by rolling he's eyes slightly when asked for a new one ya know what, I left,I've had enough of Portals slight distain. END
BEGIN NOW   I adored portal when they first set foot in the space wasabi once was but now sits a pissy example of they're former selves,polite cool,easy,clean selves. END
BEGIN NOW  Now it seems like any other place overblown semi ok food staff who seems put out by the customers of which I should add wasn't at capacity so I was surprised at the very lack of any service. END
BEGIN NOW   I've actually wanted to say this last bit for a while about the food the last few times we'd gone in it just seemed lacking undercooked food mostly. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm bummed I really did like this place. END
BEGIN NOW  We got to the restaurant 20 minutes before it opened for saturday brunch and there was already a huge line. END
BEGIN NOW   I think a lot of the line is for those who want to sit outside on a beautiful sunny Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW   And even with the line, they'll offer to get your brunch drink started. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   I wish I remembered the name of the fella that served us but he was incredibly helpful, patient and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW   Portions are HUGE so order accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW  We go the bottomless mimosa and their pours are SERIOUS. END
BEGIN NOW   it's pretty much champagne with a tiny splash of OJ. END
BEGIN NOW   Seth Rogan looking bartender: you are on point. END
BEGIN NOW   My faves in terms of food:. END
BEGIN NOW  Garbage Bread- it's a pizza burito. END
BEGIN NOW   get the meat one. END
BEGIN NOW   get it. END
BEGIN NOW   eat it. END
BEGIN NOW   you're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW  Stuffed Challah French Toast- I thought i was done eating but my arm was still shoveling it in my face. END
BEGIN NOW  Tempeh Hash- we got it with poached eggs and goat cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   perfect recommendation. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely will be coming back to enjoy the rest of the menu and the ambience outside!. END
BEGIN NOW  The door is an actual porthole. END
BEGIN NOW   Talk about puns!!. END
BEGIN NOW  I actually had a difficult time opening the door because it was so heavy lol and then I started questioning if that was even was the door in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW   To my embarrassment, it was! You just need to pull a little harder then normal. END
BEGIN NOW   I was visiting a friend and local native at Portal for a quick beer and a much needed catch up. END
BEGIN NOW   We were seated right away and the place had a lot of character! They have a wide selection of beer and wine and a phenomenal happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW  The server was cheery and helpful--he recommended the steak which was cooked to perfection! It was so tender and the seasoning was nothing like I've ever had before. END
BEGIN NOW   My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It's definitely a steak I will never forget. END
BEGIN NOW   We had some veggies on the side which were asparagus and several different types of squash that were in season--a perfect pairing with the steak. END
BEGIN NOW   The meal was very filling and we ended up sitting there talking for hours. END
BEGIN NOW  It started getting busy around 8pm and people were rolling in for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   This is a fantastic place if you live nearby and want to grab drinks after work. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm so jealous that there isn't one near me in Sacramento! Their employees are friendly and made spot-on recommendations about the food and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  Alright Portal, you surprised me last night. END
BEGIN NOW   I've eaten there seeeeeeveral times and was meh about the food. END
BEGIN NOW   But last night, my ravioli was #onpoint though. END
BEGIN NOW   Dude ate the meatball sammy which came with a heaaaaalthy portion of greens. END
BEGIN NOW   Thanks for keeping it healthy. END
BEGIN NOW   You always have an excellent selection of beers. END
BEGIN NOW   While neither of us had any of the Brewery doing the tap takeover, I love that you were a supporter of beer week. END
BEGIN NOW  The three stars because in all of my other experiences there, the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW   So perhaps the dinner entrees are just better than the brunch? I'll have to go again before I can leave a higher rating for that. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, it closes at 11 and there's not a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I understand but hey. END
BEGIN NOW  sometimes I just need a shot of vodka. END
BEGIN NOW   ;). END
BEGIN NOW  But it's a cute spot to go and have a few brews with the homies yo. END
BEGIN NOW   With a large patio and hopefully running heat lamps on cold days, it's a nice spot to go near the lake or after Rockin Crawfish. END
BEGIN NOW  I learned a very important lesson during my visit to Portal Restaurant: never visit an establishment that has multiple signs posted on the front of the building advertising the need and higher for chefs. END
BEGIN NOW   After a twenty minute wait to be seated on an early Saturday night, we were guided to four seats at a community table. END
BEGIN NOW   I think the draw of Portal or many is the large outdoor patio with views of Lake Merritt, is truly is picturesque. END
BEGIN NOW   The adult beverage list is fairly average for the area (although they claim to be a "beer garden" their selection and simply lack of beer menus makes me question this claim), their dinner menu is set with several appetizer and entree items but is not extensive. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered sharing plates for four people which included:. END
BEGIN NOW  *ricotta bites: as delicious as they sound, fried on the outside, cheesy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Portion came with four bites and a marinara sauce (sauce to bites ratio was off, request more sauce if you ever see your waitress!). END
BEGIN NOW  *cesar salad: OK, covered with parmesan cheese and house-made croutons, large portion but lacked flavor and dressing to lettuce ratio was off. END
BEGIN NOW  *brussels sprouts: Good, but damn, I feel like a good home-chef should be able to whip up some taste brussels, and these aren't any better than what I can make a home. END
BEGIN NOW  *garbage bread: Best part of the meal, hands down! Tasty, flavorful, crispy and chewy: this is their signature dish. END
BEGIN NOW   It's served with a the same marinara sauce sauce as the ricotta bites and a overly powerful pesto sauce that I'd recommend skipping. END
BEGIN NOW   Try to get extra marinara sauce when the food is dropped off. END
BEGIN NOW  *chicken wings: This was the most disappointing part of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW   We received our chicken wings (granted, our dishes were coming out in stages, so they weren't rushing to prepare everything at the same time) and the chicken was RAW. END
BEGIN NOW   We pointed it out to our waitress, she said "yes, that's raw!" and returned it to the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   Not acknowledgment more from her, no visit from the chef or manager, simply embarrassing and a terrible way to conduct business. END
BEGIN NOW   The only acknowledgement from our waitress (who practically abandoned our table!) was if we'd like to order something else instead. END
BEGIN NOW   The chicken wings weren't included on the check but our replacement item was. END
BEGIN NOW  *garlic fries: (replacement for chicken) very lackluster, they're the a-typical garlic fry of every restaurant out there. END
BEGIN NOW  I believe that Portal has been nights, but I'd stay far away until they have consistency in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   If you see that they're hiring chefs, RUN!. END
BEGIN NOW  Coming for a weekend brunch? Expect a wait - everyone wants to eat here! We came here on a rainy day and even then, there was a long line of people waiting for some brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW  PARKING: Street parking - plenty! We were able to find street parking no problem. END
BEGIN NOW  SEATING: Indoor & outdoor seating available (but when it's raining, only indoor seating available). END
BEGIN NOW   Not very many tables inside which is probably why there's a long line. END
BEGIN NOW  BAR: There's a bar also! You can grab a drink while you're waiting for your table. END
BEGIN NOW   Weekend brunch calls for AYCD mimosas from opening til 1pm!. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD: Soooo many great options! I had the Portal Benedict (you can add ham, bacon, or avocado for an extra $3). END
BEGIN NOW   You won't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu! Other highlights are the Corned Beef Hash. END
BEGIN NOW   We're in to try the Garbage Bread next time - we didn't want any leftovers this time. END
BEGIN NOW  A-okay Portal! We'll be back :) Maybe on a sunny day so we can enjoy some brunch and a stroll around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal is a gem in Oakland! It's located right next to Lake Merritt and from the outside seating, you can get a pretty nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   Came here during an off hour between lunch and dinner! The waiter was super nice and accommodating, letting us pick wherever we wanted to sit outside. END
BEGIN NOW  We started off by ordering two beers. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a pretty good variety of standard mixes and other interesting flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   The waiter helped make recommendations depending on our tastes of dark, light, and so on. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the meat garbage bread (Yelp told me to, so I had to!!) and the garlic bread meatball sub. END
BEGIN NOW   The meatballs were recommended but I love garlic bread so I figured why not mix the two of those together! The garlic bread meatball sub also came with a side salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Those two orders were more than enough for the two of us and we actually had some leftover. END
BEGIN NOW  I definitely recommend the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't let the name fool you. END
BEGIN NOW  it's definitely not garbage! The garbage bread was a treasure. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the cheese melted on top and the inside was stuffed with delicious goodies. END
BEGIN NOW   The meatball garlic sub was good but not incredibly impressive. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe it's because I'm not too big of a fan of meatballs to begin with. END
BEGIN NOW   It was definitely good but just wasn't as mind blowing as the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  I plan on coming back to Portal for brunch sometime so I heard there's a great unlimited mimosa option and they have an amazing menu for breakfast! This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat before a baseball game (which we did)!. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't think of one bad time here at Portal. END
BEGIN NOW   It's always a good time! From brunch to dinner, all times of the day are great at this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Love brunch on the patio because of all the natural sunlight that fills the backyard and love dinner on the patio too because they crank up the jams and it's beautifully lit with string lights to set the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW  Recs: Lunch- herbed garlic fries are incredible (what's in that frying oil?!), Turkey Mini Burger is my fave out all their sliders. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch- must try their polenta!. END
BEGIN NOW  Dinner- Turkey Meatballs, no need to add pasta if you're looking for a carb-less entree, so hearty and deliciously tender. END
BEGIN NOW   Fried Brussel Sprouts, the smell is intoxicating. END
BEGIN NOW  I missed out on the bottomless mimosa but glad I ordered Mr. END
BEGIN NOW   Pickles! Portal pickle their own garnishes and boy did they all go well with the spicy drink!. END
BEGIN NOW  We came around 11 on a Saturday and wait was about 20 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   This was right before the brunch rush and one of the Warriors playoffs! Would have love to enjoy their outside patio which was spacious but pretty exposed to the sun. END
BEGIN NOW   So we sat at the bar with our awesome female bartender/server, enjoyed our food and watched the Warriors kicked the Rockets booties till they were red!. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW  1. END
BEGIN NOW   House coffee - strong and good. END
BEGIN NOW  2. END
BEGIN NOW   Mr. END
BEGIN NOW   Pickles - obsessed with it. END
BEGIN NOW  3. END
BEGIN NOW   Portal Benedict - never had it on grilled polenta before so it was a unique taste. END
BEGIN NOW   Good but very filling. END
BEGIN NOW  4. END
BEGIN NOW   BF and I were so full but decided to be pigs and stuffed ourselves more with the Stuffed Challah French toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Also good but there was something else other then the ricotta filling in between those bread. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure if it was banana or plantain. END
BEGIN NOW  which I'm not a big fan of. END
BEGIN NOW  Other then that, for a bar that serves food. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal got my vote as a go-to spot for brunch or just a drink on their patio!. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything about this place is Meh. END
BEGIN NOW  The food, service, ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW   It's all meh. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm sure hipsters love this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Had my birthday dinner here on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW   We were greeted and sat quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  We tried the Sonoma bourbon cider ($6) prairie bomb beer ($12) for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   The cider came in a bottle along with a glass. END
BEGIN NOW   It was okay, not as good as I had hopped. END
BEGIN NOW   The prairie bomb was a dark beer. END
BEGIN NOW   I normally hate dark beer due to the bitterness. END
BEGIN NOW   This one was great. END
BEGIN NOW   We took down the name so we can find it later. END
BEGIN NOW  For dinner we ordered the meat garbage bread ($15) 2- sliders ($13) and BBQ frites ($8) When the food came I noticed the sliders weren't the ones we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW   Our server didn't come by for some time so we ate the garbage bread which was fabulous and the fries were great with the dipping sauces. END
BEGIN NOW   When I told our server about the slider error I asked to just have it removed from the bill since we were too stuffed to eat anymore. END
BEGIN NOW  The server came back with our bill and said the manager gave a little discount ($3. END
BEGIN NOW  90) due to the mix up. END
BEGIN NOW   That was a nice gesture. END
BEGIN NOW  The atmosphere has dim lighting, nice outdoor area and bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Hipster kind of place,. END
BEGIN NOW  No hard alcohol available. END
BEGIN NOW   Cocktails are made with suju. END
BEGIN NOW   Beer and wine available. END
BEGIN NOW  Here's the deal: I hate waiting in long lines. END
BEGIN NOW   In my experience, to avoid that and still eat breakfast here, you basically have to get here and wait for them to open. END
BEGIN NOW   For me, that means getting my butt out of bed and being outside before 8am on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW  BUT, here is what I will say. END
BEGIN NOW  - I'm that overly discerning jerk who cares about how my eggs are poached when I go to breakfast or brunch and they do them perfectly here. END
BEGIN NOW  - the coffee is delish and plentiful (Highwire, I believe). END
BEGIN NOW  - the potatoes are a mix of shredded hash and chunkier potato bits, nice and crispy (if it's not obvious from that description. END
BEGIN NOW   they're great). END
BEGIN NOW  - their biscuits are great, sweet or savory. END
BEGIN NOW  4 stars instead of 5 because I've had a couple misses here. END
BEGIN NOW   I think it was when they had first opened up. END
BEGIN NOW   In any case, I think most folks will find something they'll like on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  've had pretty much everything on their menu, and every item is so great and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Um, delicious coffee (Highwire), delish micheladas, delish food and pastries. END
BEGIN NOW   Obviously it sucks to wait in line, but whatever- this is the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW   Get used to it. END
BEGIN NOW   I like to get there early and beat the later crowd. END
BEGIN NOW  And please send whoever designed the space my way--beautiful!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  Weekday late brunch: Nailed it. END
BEGIN NOW  This spot is a total gem, nestled in the Laurel District serving up some really upscale, but down home eats. END
BEGIN NOW   Mostly breakfast, but don't fret, they do have some lunch options as well. END
BEGIN NOW   All their breads and pastries are made in house, they serve organic eggs and all meats are antibiotic and hormone free. END
BEGIN NOW   My health does matter, thank you very much!. END
BEGIN NOW  My goat cheese omelet ($13) was what dreams are made of: a fluffy omelet oozing with goat cheese, snap peas, asparagus, garlic and spring onions. END
BEGIN NOW   I inhaled it. END
BEGIN NOW   In addition to this perfect egg dish, were some crispy potatoes, salad and perfectly toasted homemade bread with house made jam. END
BEGIN NOW   DAYUUUUMMMMM. END
BEGIN NOW   Writing this review is taking back to pure eating bliss. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee was solid and prices are fair for portion sizes and service was lovely. END
BEGIN NOW   Granted, it wasn't busy at all, but this spot is a neighborhood joint and service is to match. END
BEGIN NOW   I can imagine some frustration during those weekend hours, but well worth the wait; I loved everything about Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW  Items I will be returning for: strawberry cream cheese danish, the beef hash and that cubano sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW   Sign me up. END
BEGIN NOW  A new and not-so-much longer hidden gem in Oakland's Laurel District that is the perfect place for a weekend brunch on one of those sunny days that Oakland is famous for! I am a real fan of this great neighborhood diner where everything is homemade from their pastries to their jams in addition to their classic dishes for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   And Sequoia Diner lives up the hype that's been expressed from so many reviews and images posted from my fellow Yelpers!. END
BEGIN NOW  I actually found out about Sequoia Diner due to the fact it seemed like it was on Yelp's "New Businesses in East Bay" for an eternity! It actually opened about a year ago, replacing the long-standing Full House Cafe, by a local husband and wife duo who wanted to stay loyal to the neighborhood with their seasonal brunch classics served all morning until mid-afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW   There is so much buzz for Sequoia Diner that wait times can be quite long for brunch and parking on MacArthur Avenue and the surrounding area can be quite dicey. END
BEGIN NOW   So plan ahead it you don't mind waiting. END
BEGIN NOW   Luckily, I had friends who were eager enough to get there early and put our names down and patient enough for me to get there just a wee bit late. END
BEGIN NOW  Once we were sat in their patent leather booths, we each knew what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW   (I had been doing enough research from my fellow Yelper's images and reviews to know what to order and what to pass up. END
BEGIN NOW  ) We knew we all had to get the highly-recommended Pecan Sticky Buns and at $3. END
BEGIN NOW  75 each it's a good deal, so much so, the three of us ordered two buns to share. END
BEGIN NOW   I found them not too sweet or sticky with the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and topped with an abundance of chopped pecans. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a perfect accompaniment to your coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  As for my main dish, I knew that some Sequoia Diner plates were heavier than others, but I also wanted to taste some of the best and unique dishes that they have to offer to get a read on how they prepare their meals here. END
BEGIN NOW   So I went with the Country Breakfast with its biscuit and gravy, collared greens, hash browns and two eggs made to order. END
BEGIN NOW   Although obviously heavy, my dish was solid, I especially loved the creamy gravy, warm biscuit, and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW   You could tell with the first bite how much homemade goodness was put into your meal. END
BEGIN NOW   Despite being constantly busy, the service for the most part was attentive and there was constant turnover of the tables and counter-tops, made the flow of service that much more pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW  Sequoia Diner is your classic mom-and-pop owned and operated American breakfast joint with modern day sustainable and locavore sensibilities. END
BEGIN NOW   Their eclectic menu makes me want to come back for more, everything sounds so familiar yet so unique that it seems like you can't go wrong. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't wait to return one day to see how Sequoia Diner continues to build upon their success in a loyal and foodie loving neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW  I never loved brunch much, always made me feel comatose and heavy afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW    SD has the sweetspot between comfort and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're ordering to-go, it's a good idea to call ahead, it took upwards of 30 minutes to get my order, there isn't much seating for those waiting, I ordered a coffee to hold me over while waiting, comes in super cute beige/brown cups, reminds me of the 70s and 80s. END
BEGIN NOW    Such a pleasant throwback to a simpler time. END
BEGIN NOW  LOVED the Red Flannel Hash. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfectly poached eggs, kraut to cut the richness, cubes of al dente beets and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW    They don't take substitutions. END
BEGIN NOW    I wanted to swap out one of the eggs for some chard, but had to order it separately. END
BEGIN NOW    Sour cream was mysteriously left off - perfect, I was going to omit it anyways. END
BEGIN NOW  Homemade sourdough toast were a nice counterpart to the meal. END
BEGIN NOW    Comes pre-buttered. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're there after 11AM, there are additional items you can order, got an asparagus, pea, arugula salad. END
BEGIN NOW    Sounds simple but the details were there: toasted almonds, slices of orange/blood orange, kumquats and pickled green beans. END
BEGIN NOW    Wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW  Will be my mid-day treat going forward. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything seasoned well. END
BEGIN NOW    Carefully and expertly prepared. END
BEGIN NOW    So nice to have this quality of food available. END
BEGIN NOW    4 items: $35 including tax/tip. END
BEGIN NOW  I love brunch but I don't always love brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW    So, it is no surprise that my hunt for the perfect local brunch spot has extended well into my second year in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm pleased to report the search is over. END
BEGIN NOW    Sequoia elevates humble breakfast staples -- not with a bunch of unnecessary frippery -- but by paying exquisite attention to the details. END
BEGIN NOW    Baked items are made in house including the incredible fresh biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW    The menu rotates with interesting seasonal specials. END
BEGIN NOW    On one visit, the loco moco had an incredibly rich shortrib gravy. END
BEGIN NOW    On the next, appetizers included chicken liver toasts with chicken cracklings and fig jam. END
BEGIN NOW    Good, simple food, presumably inspired by the personal tastes and whims of the chef (as well as the season) and made with heart and smarts. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't understand the long wait for this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is good, but not especially amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd say it is pretty normal American food. END
BEGIN NOW   Perhaps my wife and I missed out by not getting any of their baked goods. END
BEGIN NOW  When I saw Hazel's pictures from Sequoia Diner less than a month ago, I knew I needed to get myself over here soon. END
BEGIN NOW    Apparently I was not quick enough as word is out and an hour long wait seemed to be the constant on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW  Upon arrival, since no one was up front, I grabbed a pen and was about to put my name down on the list but a few seconds later discovered that they have a hostess taking names and got my 1 hour wait estimate. END
BEGIN NOW    They do allow you to buy a coffee to enjoy outside while you wait so this non coffee drinker did the next best thing and ordered a sticky bun to go making the wait more bearable. END
BEGIN NOW    It was love at first bite as it was not overly sweet and enough pecans with each bite. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated within 45 minutes allowing me to digest that sticky bun freeing up stomach space to fully enjoy their breakfast plates. END
BEGIN NOW    I already had my eye on the beef hash with poached eggs which was just a plate of beautiful flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   Slight saltiness of the beef hash paired with the tartness from the pickled cabbage topped with the creaminess of the poached eggs and the final punch of the arugula will have you scraping up every morsel. END
BEGIN NOW    Since hubby didn't realize that the Red Flannel Hash did not already come with meat (bacon can be added for a charge), he did end up polishing off at least 1/3 of my beef hash and slice of my bread to be satisfied (good thing I was pre-fortified with that sticky bun). END
BEGIN NOW    I had a bite of his Red Flannel Hash which had great flavors as well for a vegetarian option but I do prefer the Beef Hash one. END
BEGIN NOW  I thought the Coconut Thai Ice Tea was good and smooth with the coconut milk but like Hazel, felt like the tea flavor was way too light. END
BEGIN NOW    I rather use that $4 for another sticky bun!!. END
BEGIN NOW  What a dream on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW   Their hours are limited (sad face!) but if you can make it out here for brunch, YOU MUST!!!! Yep, this place is multiple exclamation point good. END
BEGIN NOW   My second visit was this morning at 8 am on the dot (mind you, daylight savings time just happened so it's really like 7 am and it was raining) and there were a few hungry peeps waiting outside to come in. END
BEGIN NOW  It is absolutely worth starting every meal here with a pecan sticky bun. END
BEGIN NOW   Warm and fluffy, and most importantly, totally shareable. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm telling you, you cannot be mad about anything in life after eating one of these. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like napping in a field with a hundred lambs. END
BEGIN NOW   And the coffee? Fill 'er up! They frequently make rounds to top you off of the dark, delicious brew. END
BEGIN NOW  I haven't strayed from the Country Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   I just can't! Eggs any style, biscuit with gravy, hashbrowns, collard greens. END
BEGIN NOW   I could not design a better breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   I am a serious biscuit snob (they're so simple and yet people somehow ruin the simplicity of it) and I can say, Sequoia rocks the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like the Pat Benatar of biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW   Eventually I will try their huevos rancheros. END
BEGIN NOW  The diner is bright, inviting, and has that Northern Oakland vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   They were smart about the design of the tables, where you can easily transition seating from 2 to larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW   However, this place is definitely not huge, so I have no idea how long it would take to accommodate a larger party during prime time. END
BEGIN NOW   Meanwhile, it's a perfect location for my 1:1 time with my besties. END
BEGIN NOW  Skip Montclair's subpar spots, and give Sequoia Diner a shot. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd had this bookmarked for a while, but ventured into the Laurel District in East Oakland for the first time this morning. END
BEGIN NOW   I was surprised to see that none of my trusted East Bay Yelpers had reviewed this place but was excited to give it a whirl. END
BEGIN NOW  We arrived around 8:30 and found the place mostly full, but were able to grab the last available booth with no wait. END
BEGIN NOW   It has that diner charm, with a long bar counter and several booths along the wall. END
BEGIN NOW   This isn't the place to bring a large group, but it is perfectly cozy for 2 or 4. END
BEGIN NOW   There are several adorable waitresses that were super friendly, greeting you on the way in and out, and keeping the coffee coming. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the positive vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  I like that they keep the menu relatively simple, with several classics, and a few twists. END
BEGIN NOW   No kids menu here, per se, but my boys were happy with their pastries. END
BEGIN NOW  a pecan roll and the strawberry cream cheese danish. END
BEGIN NOW   They stood on their own as a small breakfast, but would be equally nice as a shared starter while you wait on the main event. END
BEGIN NOW  I was thrilled with the mushroom and spinach scramble which, like their other egg dishes, come with some perfectly cooked and seasoned potatoes, some excellent sourdough toast, and a small rocket salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Seemingly simple, but it leaves you wondering why you can't do 'em that perfect at home. END
BEGIN NOW  The Highwire brewed coffee wasn't my favorite, but it did the trick and my cup was never empty or cold. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all, a real winner that will get added to the Sunday rotation!. END
BEGIN NOW  I was sold when I saw that they have Pecan Sticky Buns!  I love sticky buns and for some reason, it's really hard to find it in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW    I used to get them at Berkeley Bowl, but they don't have it anymore. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm also very particular about my sticky buns. END
BEGIN NOW    Often the dough is not soft enough, it is too sweet or there is too much cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW    Sequoia Diner's Pecan Sticky Bun is perfect in all respects and the price is right too. END
BEGIN NOW    $3. END
BEGIN NOW  75 for one is quite reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a nice size, so two people can easily share one. END
BEGIN NOW   We ended up ordering one with our breakfast, and I took their last one to go. END
BEGIN NOW    It'll go great with my coffee tomorrow morning!. END
BEGIN NOW  We did have other breakfast items as well. END
BEGIN NOW    My husband ordered the Beef Hash dish which came with a couple of perfectly poached eggs, pickled beets, arugula salad and carrots. END
BEGIN NOW    His plate was very colorful, and most importantly, the beef hash was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    He loved it and he was nice enough to let me taste it. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of sausage. END
BEGIN NOW   As I already had half of a sticky bun, I thought I'd just order a couple of sides and skip a big entree. END
BEGIN NOW    The biscuit was quite large and it was flaky, tender and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW    It came with a nice amount of gravy. END
BEGIN NOW    The gravy was a little under seasoned, so I had to add some salt and pepper on top. END
BEGIN NOW    The sausages were perfect with the Biscuit and Gravy. END
BEGIN NOW    You can tell that the sausages were house made and thankfully they weren't salty. END
BEGIN NOW  As for beverages, I ordered Coconut Thai Iced Tea and the hubby had the Decaf Highwire. END
BEGIN NOW    We brew Highwire Coffee at home, so we were happy to see that on their menu. END
BEGIN NOW    I was really glad they use coconut milk for their Thai Iced Tea. END
BEGIN NOW    It was really good, though I'd like to have a stronger tea flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a wait when we got there around 10:45. END
BEGIN NOW    We waited for about half hour. END
BEGIN NOW   They pretty much have a constant stream of diners, so expect to wait if you go here on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW    Service is very friendly and I really appreciate that everything is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW    We will definitely go back!. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're in the neighborhood and the wait isn't crazy, check it out. END
BEGIN NOW  We knew there wasn't a full espresso menu so put our names in and got lattes across the street at World Ground. END
BEGIN NOW   It made the wait of about 35 minutes enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW  As others have said, there's another significant wait to get your order and it's loud inside but neither were a problem for us. END
BEGIN NOW   It was nice not to be rushed and I enjoyed watching the openness of the kitchen prep area. END
BEGIN NOW  The blood orange juice was delightfully tart. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm usually partial to big fluffy waffles but I was really digging the thin crispness of theirs. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes were smashed-style and solid. END
BEGIN NOW   The huevos rancheros with chorizo were overpowered by the bold flavor of the sauce but I do appreciate how they make everything in-house, including the meat. END
BEGIN NOW  I really enjoyed coming here for their brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank goodness I came with friends so that I can taste their dish as well!. END
BEGIN NOW  One thing I did not like was that we had to wait for an hour to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW   But then again, what do you expect for Sunday brunch right?!?. END
BEGIN NOW  I order their coconut Thai iced tea and I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW   I believe my friend was indifferent about the drink though. END
BEGIN NOW   My hubby got the matcha almond iced latte and I thought it was OK but he liked it. END
BEGIN NOW   He did get less honey in the drink so if he got it the normal way, I probably would have liked it more. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered their Country Breakfast and that was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW   It came with a biscuit and sausage gravy, two eggs, greens, and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   The highlight for this entree was the biscuit since it was so freakin' moist, soft, buttery! I tried my friend's beef hash and I so liked his dish more than mine. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd definitely come back here for their pastries, beef hash, and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW  Sequoia, the new home of the now long-gone and super mediocre Full House, is a little gem of a hipster haven worth pushing past the throngs of screaming toddlers and hoards of impatient soon-to-be patrons for. END
BEGIN NOW   It's pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   Serving up the usual diner fare with their own flare and fancy (and a bit of a price hike, juheard?), Sequoia aims to please by grabbing you in with something you're familiar with and getting a good grip on you with their unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   I usually storm the joint on a Sunday or Saturday morning with m'ladies, but today's dolo trip offered a more reflective experience and prompted me to step outside of my usual "two eggs and toast with avo on the side" comfort zone. END
BEGIN NOW  I was surprised to find when I walked up around 10 A. END
BEGIN NOW  M. END
BEGIN NOW   on a Wednesday that the diner already had a significant crowd outside. END
BEGIN NOW   They didn't have pitchforks just yet but they looked like they were hungry enough to turn into an angry mob. END
BEGIN NOW   Luckily, I signed in with the lovely hostess and was at a counter seat within ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   Once seated, I ordered a mimosa and decided today was the day I'd get jiggy with that Red Flannel Hash I had heard so much about and constantly peered over people's heads to get a better look at. END
BEGIN NOW   I also decided to forego the sliced sourdough in favor of a biscuit so I could finally weigh in on those, as I've heard they're pretty good here. END
BEGIN NOW  My mimosa was sad and unimpressive, mostly because the orange juice seemed suspect. END
BEGIN NOW   But the Red Flannel Hash and the biscuit both surpassed my expectations! The Red Flannel Hash is one of those textural and flavor landscapes I live for: warm, crunchy, soft and runny meets savory, sweet, tart and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW   The pickled cabbage that comes with the hash is equal parts culinary genius and just damned good pairing for a poached egg and hash combo. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't really get into the sour cream glob on the side but I'm not a sour cream girl. END
BEGIN NOW  The biscuit is just as buttery and flaky and scrumptious as you've heard. END
BEGIN NOW   But the nuances of seasonality scalded me: I got stuck with cranberry preserves, which were pretty gross. END
BEGIN NOW   Still, the biscuit remained sweet and resilient in the face of something so bitter, as we all should. END
BEGIN NOW   Life lessons, brought to you by Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW  A great new spot for the best breakfast in town!  You gotta be patient though, as there is always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW    Just put your name on the list and have a cuppa. END
BEGIN NOW  Farm fresh greens and in house biscuits can't be beat!  I have tried the country breakfast and the Benedict - both excellent!  The potatoes are amazing and crispy _ you won't be disappointed!. END
BEGIN NOW  If you have time for a leisurely wait and want your coffee cup "warmed up" as you hang out with the Laurel District gentrifiers, this is your spot. END
BEGIN NOW  At prime time there's quite a wait and the parking shituation  is very competitive on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW   The coffee? So-so. END
BEGIN NOW   Are you hungry? The kitchen isn't as speedy as it should be, but "have some more coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  ". END
BEGIN NOW  Been here a few times and this premium-priced trendy breakfast spot serves up great food but is a bit over-hyped. END
BEGIN NOW   The original vision is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   Hopefully, they can get more efficient to make the wait and price with the visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Still, it's a four star cafe. END
BEGIN NOW  11/20/15. END
BEGIN NOW   Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  This feels like Valencia Street in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW   A diner serves modern twists of traditional breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   The well-lit space has a dining encounter, booths and tables. END
BEGIN NOW   The tables are also reminiscent of the city--they are packed pretty tight. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  *Golden Waffle ($7. END
BEGIN NOW  50) is thin eggo-like topped with candied apples. END
BEGIN NOW   It's the kind of waffle we prefer, not the thick Belgian kind. END
BEGIN NOW  *Spinach and Mushroom Scramble ($12) is the only scramble on the menu so here it is. END
BEGIN NOW   It's perfectly done with runny scrambled egg woven evenly with spinach and fresh mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not a cheese person usually but the Swiss is not overpowering and adds flavor to the egg. END
BEGIN NOW   Served with arugula salad, fried potato and a thick buttered toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Hearty and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee is constantly refilled. END
BEGIN NOW   It's from Hot Wire. END
BEGIN NOW   They also gave fresh-squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW   The homemade goods for the day are cranberry scone ($3) and pecan sticky bun ($3. END
BEGIN NOW  50) both of which are tempting. END
BEGIN NOW  Berkeley appears to be bleeding into Oakland, as this locally owned and sourced cafe felt like a place you would expect to find about twenty minutes north of this location. END
BEGIN NOW   I've never been to Laurel before, but it's one of those transitional, culturally diverse neighborhoods where you could have a cup of artisan coffee one minute but you feel a need to keep staring at your car while it's parked on the street. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a Temescal-in-waiting, and if it does become the East Bay's next gourmet ghetto, you can thank the husband-and-wife team of Andrew Vennari and Sequoia Broderson who opened this comfy-cozy spot which drew quite a few for breakfast on Saturday morning (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1L2zRnZ). END
BEGIN NOW  As usual in Oakland, I was done with my haircut and found myself here in a peckish state. END
BEGIN NOW   Although it was only about a ten-minute wait for me, I was surprised by the constant stream of people looking to dine here since it's fairly nondescript from the outside. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I could tell why the attraction by the eclectic selection of breakfasts on the menu including a $13 Huevos Rancheros and the same-priced Shakshuka, an Israeli-originated melange of squash, peppers, garbanzo beans, lebni (kefir cheese) and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   That all sounded appetizing, but I adhered to the Patriot Act and ordered the all-American-sounding Beef Hash (also $13), certainly not a Hormel Mary Kitchen canned creation by any stretch. END
BEGIN NOW  It consisted of shredded slow-braised beef chuck mashed up and fried on the griddle with potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   You could barely see it on the plate because it was covered by big shavings of raw carrots, arugula and a pair of poached eggs with homemade rye toast on the side (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1WEvNpS). END
BEGIN NOW   It looked almost downright healthy but not really, just tasty in a Berkeley commune kind of way with a bit of a kick from a dusting of horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW   As much as I like this dish - and I did - I have to admit it was overshadowed by the sheer flakiness of the freshly baked $3. END
BEGIN NOW  25 Strawberry Scone (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1NieroA). END
BEGIN NOW   Worth every penny and perfectly complemented by the slightly overpriced $2. END
BEGIN NOW  75 cup of Highwire Coffee (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1Nz1w6h). END
BEGIN NOW   Now where is Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  bold, fresh flavors for such dinerish fare with a standout scone. END
BEGIN NOW  AMBIANCE - 3. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  nice, all-white interior (I mean the walls, not the people. END
BEGIN NOW  sort of) in a neighborhood still looking for its identity. END
BEGIN NOW  SERVICE - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  very friendly and attentive server. END
BEGIN NOW  TOTAL - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  coming back for the Shakshuka. END
BEGIN NOW  but seriously, where's Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything we have ordered came out delicious! The sticky buns were made so you can dream about them when you are hungry ! it s packed up weekends but the best time is during the week. END
BEGIN NOW   I am soon happy this dinner is in the Laurel district a few blocks from my house. END
BEGIN NOW  Good job!. END
BEGIN NOW  When my old roommate from college decided she wanted eggs for breakfast, Montclair Egg Shop seemed like a very logical answer to her hunger. END
BEGIN NOW   There ended up being a 40 minute wait when we showed up at 12 pm on a Saturday, but that led us to exploring the area for the first time (spoiler: there isn't much to do, but there IS a really good bookstore in the area). END
BEGIN NOW  THE BASICS. END
BEGIN NOW  + It's a very old-fashioned sort of place, like a dusty diner, but in the best possible way. END
BEGIN NOW  + At least 50% of the menu (if not more) focuses on eggs (logically so) - meaning you should really order something with eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  + Service is pretty fast considering how slammed they get for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  + Their egg creations are quite good (egg shop ham & cheese potato pancakes ftw). END
BEGIN NOW  It's kind of amazing that this place has been around and in business for 42 years - definitely a solid place!. END
BEGIN NOW  thought my friend meant "eggslut" when he suggested this place, but either way it's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW   Our server was Antonio and he's just the sweetest thing; genuinely cared about our time there. END
BEGIN NOW  It took me a while to order because I couldn't decide between the french toast or the crêpes, but I thoroughly enjoyed my french toast. END
BEGIN NOW   The ambiance is quaint and mellow, much like the rest of the street outside. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all: service was great, brunch was lovely, and despite their lack of variety in coffee, I definitely recommend this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Ah the egg shop. END
BEGIN NOW   This place seems like an iconic part of Montclair. END
BEGIN NOW  The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW   We came here after my best friend had a minor surgery, and were immediately greeted warmly and seated. END
BEGIN NOW   The hostess took our drink orders, and when we hadn't received them by the time our waiter showed up, he immediately ran to do it himself. END
BEGIN NOW   Very cool. END
BEGIN NOW   To the hostesses' credit, it was super busy, and she apologized. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is. END
BEGIN NOW  okay. END
BEGIN NOW   I opted for chilequiles and was a bit disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW   For one, the eggs were over soft- no choice as to how to cook them, and the salsa was bland. END
BEGIN NOW   The quest fresco was rubbery. END
BEGIN NOW   I went from excited to "I can barely eat this" pretty quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  My best friend got a large waffle with whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW   She said it was pretty damned good. END
BEGIN NOW   Portion sizes are relatively large. END
BEGIN NOW  Basic breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing fancy. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't think I'd spend the money to come back. END
BEGIN NOW  Very nice people working here though. END
BEGIN NOW   The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW  Ohmygoodness!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is beyond cute. END
BEGIN NOW   It's located in their cute little downtown. END
BEGIN NOW  Has a "small-town" vibe to it. END
BEGIN NOW  Walking in - the décor reminded me of Leavenworth in WA - Bavarian. END
BEGIN NOW   SUPER CUTE!. END
BEGIN NOW  You sign-in at the notepad they have at the podium & have a seat. END
BEGIN NOW  There isn't necessarily a hostess - someone behind the counter, cooking was the one that told me to put my name down. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated immediately - there was no one in front of us - so that could be lucky for us. END
BEGIN NOW  There is ample seating & the restaurant looks a lot smaller than it really is. END
BEGIN NOW  They took our drink orders quickly but took a little longer to take our food orders. END
BEGIN NOW  The food did come quickly though - a PLUS in case you're super hungry. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered one of their specials - Garden Omelet which had asparagus, zucchini, spinach, & a bunch of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW  I honestly took a couple bites & knew that it wasn't my cup o' tea. END
BEGIN NOW  My whole omelet tasted like asparagus. END
BEGIN NOW   Sure, it wouldn't bother me so much but it was just really bland -_-. END
BEGIN NOW  No flavor whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh! I substituted the potato fries for fruit - as usual it cost extra. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, my friend ordered bacon on the side & they charged her 4 dollars. END
BEGIN NOW   Just FYI. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all - I wasn't really impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Sad to say, I took the omelet home but pretty much threw it away & made my own omelet. END
BEGIN NOW  One of thine partner in crimes and I had a hankering for a tasty brunch experience and a tall glass'a mimosa to start our New Year off right. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not ashamed to admit that I called several other eateries first to see how long the wait time was (and whether they served alcohol) before we ended up here. END
BEGIN NOW   The wait was about 35 minutes, giving us plenty of time to determine what we would be eating before we were seated. END
BEGIN NOW  I chose two eggs scrambled with jack cheese, home fries, an english muffin and a side of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   My accomplice dined on the Egg Shop's signature Ham, Cheese & Potato Pancake, which comes with scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   With the exception of my "Home Fried Potatoes", the meal was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes were greasy, undercooked and inedible so I didn't touch them. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend said that her potato pancake was good and didn't suffer from the grease problem that my home freezies did. END
BEGIN NOW   The jealousy was flagrant but I was still happy for her. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus I was too focused on the delicious pomegranate mimosa in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was Adolfo and he was totally attentive, super sweet and didn't make us feel rushed or act irritated even though by the time we were seated the place was pretty much closed. END
BEGIN NOW   And who wouldn't want to get the hell out of their job on New Year's Day? Thanks again!. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Belgium waffle topped with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream with a side of eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything was delicious, but I had to knock a star off because their coffee was not my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW   It was bitter and just seemed old. END
BEGIN NOW   It didn't taste like a freshly brewed cup of coffee and that dented my eating experience a bit. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd like to bring my own in the future without being judged. END
BEGIN NOW  The price was great, the ambiance was really cute. END
BEGIN NOW   There's writing on the ceiling and behind the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   Really neat place. END
BEGIN NOW  Like any good brunch spot, there was a wait and for some reason my cell service was not the best here so talk amongst yourselves. END
BEGIN NOW   hahaha And don't give up on checking in!!. END
BEGIN NOW  The service here is always wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW   All the servers and hosts are super friendly with their guests and each other. END
BEGIN NOW  I always order something different but I love their "make your own" omelets. END
BEGIN NOW   The coffee is good too. END
BEGIN NOW   I think it'd be super cute if the upstairs were open for eating too because there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   But whatever, it's never more than a 15 minute wait. END
BEGIN NOW   You know this place must be great if the neighboring restaurants are usually empty while people are waiting to eat here. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely a favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW  So I wanted to try a new place and this place had good reviews and the food pics looked great. END
BEGIN NOW   The main thing I wanted to get was the pancakes, but by the time the server came to take our order they "ran out" of pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW   How do you run out of pancakes? Can't you just make more batter?. END
BEGIN NOW  Going in it has a very rustic welcoming feel. END
BEGIN NOW   The red brick walls and fireplace makes it more personable. END
BEGIN NOW   Most tables are 2 seaters so because there were 4 of us we were seated in the back. END
BEGIN NOW   It was nice and quiet. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Egg Shop Ham&Cheese Potato Pancake and hubby got the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW   The potato pancake is basically hash browns with ham and cheese which I was looking forward to. END
BEGIN NOW   Unfortunately I was informed it has cilantro which it doesn't state on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   It also didn't state it contains onions and green onions which I discovered after taking my first bite. END
BEGIN NOW   That's about when my gag reflex kicked in. END
BEGIN NOW   Me and onions don't like each other. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd never have ordered it if it said those 2 items were in there. END
BEGIN NOW   Ended up eating my daughter's French toast while she ate the hubby's side order of Belgian waffle. END
BEGIN NOW   Yeah they can make waffles but not pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW  Hubby was not impressed by the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW   It was ok but was more potatoes and veggies than corned beef. END
BEGIN NOW  Their soft drinks were a cup of ice with a soda can so no "refills". END
BEGIN NOW   At $1. END
BEGIN NOW  50-$2. END
BEGIN NOW  50 a can I opted for water. END
BEGIN NOW  A little pricey but ok for just me and hubby. END
BEGIN NOW   Not a place we'd bring the kids because our kids eat more than their serving size. END
BEGIN NOW   Lol. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all it was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW   I might try it again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it and I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone just yet. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe next time. END
BEGIN NOW  maybe. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious french toast and Belgian waffles :). END
BEGIN NOW   With fresh strawberries and whipped cream! Their orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and all of their servers were very nice!! The ambience was chill and kind of eccentric but I liked it! Clowns and trains, and old timey things. END
BEGIN NOW   My only complaint! Was one particularly creepy waiter who worked there and hit on me and my sister and stared every time he walked by. END
BEGIN NOW   Not what I'm looking for with my breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  A little disappointed in this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Came here on a Sunday at 10:30am. END
BEGIN NOW   Limited street parking because there is a farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW   Also took 30 mins to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW   Guess it's the only joint in town. END
BEGIN NOW   Ordered the Benedict with crab cake and also the bloody mary with sake. END
BEGIN NOW   My benedict was very disapponting. END
BEGIN NOW   Eggs were overcooked. END
BEGIN NOW   When I cut into them, the yolk was cooked. END
BEGIN NOW   Also there was avocado skin in my meal that should have been thrown out and random peices of corn?? As for the bloody mary, there was nothing special tasting about it. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall, had high hopes, but the meal was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW    It was packed and there was a long wait. END
BEGIN NOW    Food and service were both good. END
BEGIN NOW    I had the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW    Very good!  Nice spot, highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW  Omg. END
BEGIN NOW   Their jam though. END
BEGIN NOW   Homemade. END
BEGIN NOW  Apricot jam. END
BEGIN NOW   I wanted to steal the whole jar haha! I always get their scramble which is nicely done. END
BEGIN NOW   The eggs are in the runnier side and that's the way I like my eggs! It was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel conflicted about giving this place only 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I have nothing but good memories at this neighborhood place (used to come here in high school). END
BEGIN NOW   The service was wonderful but the food was pretty mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW   My eggs benedict was soggy from the generous amount of hollandaise. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't get me wrong, I love hollandaise with all my heart, but there is such a thing as too much. END
BEGIN NOW   I could also tell that the crab cake had a ton of filler/binder. END
BEGIN NOW   Kind of a nitpicky complaint, but my avocado slices were bruised (at least cut away the bruised parts). END
BEGIN NOW   Bf really liked his potato pancakes though. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfectly crisp and seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW   Food here is like diner food but better, but only a little better. END
BEGIN NOW   The plastic plates and dingy cups don't help. END
BEGIN NOW  We typically go here for breakfast meetings and it is never a disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a variety of breakfast items to choose from, whether you have a hankering for a standard 2 eggs and bacon breakfast or maybe a sweeter dish like waffles, or more ethnic dish like breakfast tacos, they have it here!. END
BEGIN NOW  Yesterday I ordered the breakfast tacos which honestly is the best deal. END
BEGIN NOW    For 8. END
BEGIN NOW  95, you get two tacos with greens, bacon, and eggs how you want it, covered with salsa and a side of half an avocado. END
BEGIN NOW    As you can see from the picture, it's a huge dish!. END
BEGIN NOW  Great flavor and fast service. END
BEGIN NOW    On the weekends though, there may be a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   But, totally worth it!. END
BEGIN NOW  +/- THE FOOD. END
BEGIN NOW  I had really high expectations for this place seeing that it was so packed when I went. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the chicken apple sausage scramble and a pomegranate mimosa and it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW   The scramble was rather bland and didn't have any attributes that stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW   The mimosa was definitely 80% champagne and 20% juice. END
BEGIN NOW   I tasted no pomegranate whatosever. END
BEGIN NOW   I also tried my friend's regular orange mimosa and same thing- too much champagne. END
BEGIN NOW  + THE ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is absolutely adorable. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like you stepped into a little cottage from a storybook. END
BEGIN NOW   The restaurant is neatly decorated with a bunch of gadgets and gizmos like toy trains and inspirational quotes on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW   The place is pretty small but very clean. END
BEGIN NOW  We went to the Montclair Egg Shop this week for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW   We were seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW   I was hungry so I ordered the challah bread French toast and an omelette with bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, and jack cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  The omelette was your standard size and was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   The French toast was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread was too flat/thin and it tasted just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  The prices were good and the service was good as well. END
BEGIN NOW   We will return!. END
BEGIN NOW  Breakfast of Champions! You know it's that good if you saw Andre Iguodala enjoying his breakfast while you were here. END
BEGIN NOW   Shared the potato pancake and salmon scramble, both were delicious and hearty. END
BEGIN NOW  NBA Finals MVP approved! #StrengthInNumbers #NBAChamps #Warriors. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is good. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  Attractive interior. END
BEGIN NOW  If you are into America style breakfast no doubt it suits to your pallet. END
BEGIN NOW  Vs decent European breakfast places eg in the nicer parts of London, there is way more sugar and other high glycogen index ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW   such ingredients are not too my taste, leave me feeling bloated and of course contributes to putting on weight. END
BEGIN NOW  scrambled eggs with salmon:-- like most America breakfast the egg was more like an omelet chopped up. END
BEGIN NOW   The salmon is mixed in to the egg, which also makes it more difficult to cook to the best consistency. END
BEGIN NOW  old fashioned oaks:-- expecting big fat Scottish rolled oats which typically have lots of flavour, but found them to be more like typical modern rolled oats. END
BEGIN NOW   I asked for no sugar but there was shed loads of both brown sugar and honey. END
BEGIN NOW   It was sweeter than a pudding. END
BEGIN NOW   The oats were also overlooked and had lost all there lost form. END
BEGIN NOW  they kindly took it back and brought me a version with no sugar or honey and the oats were less cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  Mocha:- pleasant but massive(full size tall  glass) too sweet, suspect they use the chocolate syrup as couldn't taste much cocoa. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all pretty consistent with other American breakfast places I've been to above average atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be making my own breakfast until I discover a decent place. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here a second time for dinner instead of brunch this time. END
BEGIN NOW  DRINKS- Plaid on plaid drink was so good! Love those egg white drinks, and they do it well here. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD- Tried their famous fried chicken, and it was soooo juicy!! I was surprised. END
BEGIN NOW   Just wish there were more vegetables since they only gave 2 pieces of asparagus with 2 giant fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW  ATMOSPHERE- modern, restaurant is small inside, so we sat outside which was quite nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Lively neighborhood to grab dinner at. END
BEGIN NOW  OVERALL- Awesome restaurant!. END
BEGIN NOW  Sorry to be late in posting this. END
BEGIN NOW  life gets in the way, especially when one is remodeling [smile]. END
BEGIN NOW  After a lovely 2014 Holiday Series dinner, the 2015 Holiday Series dinner, which essentially promised the same menu of various goose dishes, was a real letdown. END
BEGIN NOW   Cost-cutting undermined  the once-lovely appetizer plate, which had a similar trio of dishes but was less generous,less interesting, and more green salad than anything else. END
BEGIN NOW  Entree dish was salty (confit; insufficiently rinsed) and greasy (potatoes). END
BEGIN NOW   The breast meat was chewy even tho sliced thin, and a touch overseasoned with thyme. END
BEGIN NOW   Grilled escarole was a nice bitter element but the plate was surprisingly dull-looking, especially compared to prior year's plate where bright Fuyu persimmons provided a lovely accent in both color and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopscotch's dessert menu is annoyingly banal. END
BEGIN NOW   In an area filled with great pastry chefs, offering mud pie or donuts is disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW   We tried the latter, which were dull and served with a too-sweet butterscotch cream. END
BEGIN NOW   It has no depth, and since the donuts are just fried dough, a little something more interesting is needed than just additional sugar on top of grease and flour. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall: a big miss which left us sad. END
BEGIN NOW   Itani's one of Oakland's premier groundbreaking chefs, but we're finding better food elsewhere these days. END
BEGIN NOW  Meat-heavy, drink-heavy. END
BEGIN NOW   Despite diner decor, this is for people who know little about food. END
BEGIN NOW   Mel's in SF makes this place look sick. END
BEGIN NOW   Thunderously noisy, even though there's not many tables. END
BEGIN NOW  - Fish'n'chips. END
BEGIN NOW   Travesty. END
BEGIN NOW   Little pieces of heavily battered fish. END
BEGIN NOW   Much vaunted duck fat chips are a waste of $2. END
BEGIN NOW   There are many places where duck fat fries are worth the upcharge. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopscotch is not one of them. END
BEGIN NOW   The three of us compared them head-to-head with the regular fries, and found very, very, very scant difference. END
BEGIN NOW   Both regular and duck fat were slightly too greasy; we like our chips a bit crisper. END
BEGIN NOW  - Fried chicken was a fried disaster. END
BEGIN NOW   The batter was the extra-crispy style, which Spouse dislikes, and was fried so hard and so long that even the dark meat was dried out. END
BEGIN NOW   It also had the dessicated look of fried food that had been sitting around, although he said it was very hot all the way through. END
BEGIN NOW   He did like the raw pickled cauliflower florets with it, however. END
BEGIN NOW  - Burger with tongue & the pork belly extra. END
BEGIN NOW   Burger unsalted (big NO-NO) and didn't cover the bun. END
BEGIN NOW   Slice of tongue was super-tiny and dried out. END
BEGIN NOW   Pork belly griddled so it was just chewy thick bacon, much ado about nothing. END
BEGIN NOW   The bun was good, but buttered before grilling, making it greasy. END
BEGIN NOW   Adding mayo and aioli just made it even greasier. END
BEGIN NOW   Ordered medium-rare, but came medium. END
BEGIN NOW   No option for cheese, highly irritating because this puppy needed some salt (and I don't often say that, being on 20 yrs of low-salt diet!). END
BEGIN NOW   Needed a whole lot more of those pickled onions to get any flavor through all the oil slick. END
BEGIN NOW  Iced tea was a very strange black tea/sassafras blend. END
BEGIN NOW   Does anybody seriously think weak flat root beer flavoring makes good iced tea???  But the ginger limeade was superb. END
BEGIN NOW   By itself, however, one good juice drink isn't enough to be worth the schlep out here. END
BEGIN NOW  Try Spice Monkey for fish'n'chips, Pican or Bistro 1491 for fried chicken, and anywhere else for a burger. END
BEGIN NOW  If only yelp allowed half stars, 3. END
BEGIN NOW  5 would be my true rating. END
BEGIN NOW  Service. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW   Love the ambience. END
BEGIN NOW   Small, cozy space. END
BEGIN NOW   Restaurant was slow. END
BEGIN NOW   Walked in. END
BEGIN NOW   No hostess. END
BEGIN NOW   Then she appeared behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Attended to a customer who had a takeout order, but neglected to greet us afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW   Had to approach her to ask, "Do we seat ourselves?". END
BEGIN NOW   Unenthusiastically, she responded, "No, I will. END
BEGIN NOW  " Half star ticked right off for that!. END
BEGIN NOW  The server was friendly, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't stand when a waiter asks you five times in 10 min intervals, "How is everything?". END
BEGIN NOW  There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant and they are dog friendly, yay!! My friend asked the server for some chicken for the dog and (although it took a while. END
BEGIN NOW  ) he came back with perfectly grilled slices of chicken (4 bucks a breast). END
BEGIN NOW   The food came out in a timely manner, but our additional order of the two Yonsei Oysters were lagging and we even thought that that it might have been forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW   There were only three other tables at this time. END
BEGIN NOW   Another half star ticked off!. END
BEGIN NOW  Food. END
BEGIN NOW  Start-Little Green Salad with butter lettuce, baby kale, (shaved) celery, hazelnuts, soft sheeps cheese, Sherry vinaigrette: (warning: it's truly starter size and takes four full bites to eat. END
BEGIN NOW  ) Some bites were overly salted and others under. END
BEGIN NOW   The sheeps cheese was the star. END
BEGIN NOW   Greens were crisp and can't hate on those toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW   Last half star ticked off for this one!. END
BEGIN NOW  Main-Buttermilk Fried Chicken with black sesame asparagus: DAMN, that crusty, crunchy, flakey, party in yo mouth chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW   Tell me your secrets! It's a GIANT chicken drumstick+thigh. END
BEGIN NOW   The meat itself was well cooked over a bed of cabbage slaw. END
BEGIN NOW   Finally, topped with two grilled asparagus (keepin those expectations realistic!). END
BEGIN NOW   Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but pretty darn good. END
BEGIN NOW  Side-Yonsei Oysters with sea urchin, salmon roe and citrus: Real fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW   These were the good ones. END
BEGIN NOW   Little sweet oysters. END
BEGIN NOW   Gotta love that sea brine. END
BEGIN NOW   More citrus than soy, but how can you go wrong that roe and sea urchin??! A dozen more please!. END
BEGIN NOW  I really wanted to like this place for brunch but only had an ok experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Warning:. END
BEGIN NOW  -Coffee was/is terrible! Sorry but it's either the beans you're using, lack of extraction when brewing or maybe the coffee machine needs to be decalcify. END
BEGIN NOW  We asked for another cup with a new pot and tasted just as bad. END
BEGIN NOW  -Place gets heated up fast. END
BEGIN NOW   Seems like no AC so expect to sweat on a warm day. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't imagine in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW  Now to food. END
BEGIN NOW  1. END
BEGIN NOW   Buttermilk fried chicken - crispy, juicy, fresh and hot. END
BEGIN NOW   Chicken and gravy were the best part of my brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   However, biscuit was hard and chewy. END
BEGIN NOW   Side of fruits tasted sour and old :( Also no choice on how you want your eggs when you order this dish. END
BEGIN NOW   Only scrambled. END
BEGIN NOW  2. END
BEGIN NOW   Mushroom Benedict - lacks flavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Need a lil truffle oil or something to enhance the shiitake mushrooms and need to reduce the cream on the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  3. END
BEGIN NOW   Donuts - good but really small for the portion. END
BEGIN NOW  only 3 mini round donuts. END
BEGIN NOW   Gotta split the 3rd :/. END
BEGIN NOW  Honestly don't know if I'll try this place again. END
BEGIN NOW   Tempted to go back and order the Benedict with pork belly but not sure I can convince the BF to give it another shot. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a cute, trendy spot in Uptown Oakland where customers ranging from college students to older, more mature patrons come to dine. END
BEGIN NOW   It is a tiny restaurant, but there is seating both inside and outside, and the decorations are spot-on. END
BEGIN NOW   The menu changes for lunch and dinner, and are limited to about 5-7 offerings, and is on the pricey side. END
BEGIN NOW  I came here once for brunch and another time for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  My favorite is the yonsei oysters, which includes salmon roe and uni on the half shell, a perfect Asian fusion dish. END
BEGIN NOW   They taste fresh and complex. END
BEGIN NOW   One second you taste the salty juices of the roe, then you taste the sweet briny freshness of the uni, followed by the cool ocean flavor of the oysters. END
BEGIN NOW   The portions are a bit small but they are definitely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  For brunch, I had the braised pork belly benedict. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork belly was cooked perfectly, crunchy and tender at the right places. END
BEGIN NOW   The hollandaise sauce was the right amount of creamy and citrusy. END
BEGIN NOW   I liked that it was a well-executed twist on a classic brunch platter. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I did not like the dinner dishes as much. END
BEGIN NOW   They seemed a bit too average for the price you pay. END
BEGIN NOW   Granted, I'm sure they use the most high quality and the freshest ingredients, but at $19 for a plate of pasta and $22 for clams, I sort of expect something out of this world. END
BEGIN NOW  The soba bucatini is very tomatoey but tastes just a bit better than the average pasta, though the green beans do add a nice crunch. END
BEGIN NOW   The manila clams were yummy and it came with a deep-fried vegetable that paired well with the seafood tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I felt the prices were too high for what my bf and I got. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, this is a nice little date spot, but much more so for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a bar and serve all types of alcohol, so it's great for boozey brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Any chance to try a new brunch place is gladly taken - #brunchsohard! We heard this place has a better brunch menu than dinner. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a very small location but there's apparently more seating next door! You can make reservations too, so definitely plan ahead. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything on their menu was tempting - American brunch fare with a Korean twist, what better combination could there be!? I just had to go for the kimchee fried rice with shoyu eggs and pork belly. END
BEGIN NOW   Tender, flavorful, spicy and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW  every bite was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   We also got to try the donuts with butterscotch cream (it should be a sin to have this for breakfast) and the cinnamon challah toast with jam (how is this so soft?!). END
BEGIN NOW   I had a bite of their famous fried chicken and biscuits for whatever room was left in my stomach and wow it was not your typical chicken and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW  Based on my experience today, you will not be disappointed no matter what you order. END
BEGIN NOW   Wish we had this place closer to home. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd be ordering that kimchee fried rice on a weekly basis. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with a Yonsei Oyster and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken--both were good, but both items are way overpriced which disallows me from giving this place anymore than 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything else about the experience here was outstanding except the $23 chicken that didn't even come with a carb on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   That dish is worth $13-$15 at most. END
BEGIN NOW   It was literally just some fried chicken (sure, dredged in their signature marinade of buttermilk, soy sauce, and potato starch), some asparagus, and chrysanthemum salad with vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW   The chicken was juicy and tasty but it wasn't even a decent size--was still hungry after. END
BEGIN NOW   You can argue that this one dish alone isn't supposed to fill you up however I think that the very essence of fried chicken is a comfort food that serves the purpose of filling you up and if someone wants to make it extra special, he/she can do that, but he/she doesn't need to make it so fancy it becomes small and too expensive. END
BEGIN NOW   It's fried chicken, how much extra does your buttermilk and soy sauce cost? This isn't Napa where you're surrounded by million dollar wineries. END
BEGIN NOW   I can understand overpriced oysters, but $23 fried chicken in Oakland? You've got to be kidding me. END
BEGIN NOW  Since I wasn't fully satisfied, I had to go to Belly down the street which is where I should've went to in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW   Literally, if they just added something like mashed or scalloped potatoes, this dish would be on point. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not sure why everyone raves about it. END
BEGIN NOW   Furthermore, I've never complained about negative space on a dish but even from the consumer point of view, the dish didn't come together well looks-wise. END
BEGIN NOW   It'll leave you hanging like, "where's the rest of my food?" The oyster was pretty delicious, but not worth $5. END
BEGIN NOW  So, I honestly would recommend checking out Hopscotch and I want to come back someday to give it another try, but please do yourself a favor and refrain from ordering that fried chicken--you're better off going to 'insert-your-favorite-fast-food-fried-chicken-joint here'. END
BEGIN NOW  On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and it's a cozy unique atmosphere that defines the rising Oakland food scene. END
BEGIN NOW   I believe it might be best to make reservations if you're anticipating to come with friends during peak eating times. END
BEGIN NOW  I have to say Hopscotch has a pretty delicious brunch! This was my first time brunching in Oakland as opposed to SF, and it was pretty positive overall. END
BEGIN NOW   The setup of the restaurant is a little confusing, as there are two separate rooms separated by a convenience store in the middle. END
BEGIN NOW   We dined in the second room, which I actually thought had a nicer and more spacious layout. END
BEGIN NOW  We started off the meal with some mimosas and the Donuts and Butterscotch Cream. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely try these because they're super warm and fluffy, and the butterscotch is so good you'll literally want to bottle it and take it home! We decided to split a couple of the entrees, so we ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Biscuits, which had a really tasty gravy drizzled on top. END
BEGIN NOW   The biscuit was nice and flaky and you can tell it's homemade. END
BEGIN NOW   We also got the Kimchee Fried Rice with pork belly, which was the standout of the meal for me. END
BEGIN NOW   The rice was really authentic, and I loved the addition of the jidori eggs!. END
BEGIN NOW  I've heard Hopscotch also has a delicious dinner menu, so I'd definitely come back to check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW  The combination of Beer (hops) and Scotch is already awesome but add gastro pub grub and you have the makings of a winner! The place is split into two separate rooms that are surrounding some other business so that's a bit strange at first. END
BEGIN NOW   The main room where the hostess is located is quite small and I was wondering if we were going to fit. END
BEGIN NOW   After a very short walk to their "annex" as they called it, we were pleased to find more larger tables and room for our party of four. END
BEGIN NOW   Both rooms were sparsely decorated and appeared that the building was from the early 1900s, it had a cozy feel. END
BEGIN NOW  I had to start with a Hop / Scotch Pairing. END
BEGIN NOW   I went with the Nikka Coffee Whiskey paired with Fort Point Charred Manzanita Red Ale ($14). END
BEGIN NOW   The Scotch was served neat with both water and ice on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   I popped a single rock into the scotch to open it up a bit and proceeded to sip back and forth off the two enjoying how the flavors played off each other in harmony. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu is spartan with only 5 entree offerings and 6 starter options. END
BEGIN NOW   My wife had the ribs and I got to try one, they were quite good. END
BEGIN NOW   They were tender but not too tender, seasoned well and served with Japanese Sweet Potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the "First Base" Burger. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a blend of house ground chuck and beef tongue. END
BEGIN NOW   Now beef tongue is not usually something I seek out but I was feeling adventurous. END
BEGIN NOW   I took a chance and ordered it medium rare on the waitresses suggestion and unfortunately is came out about as rare as I've ever seen a burger. END
BEGIN NOW   I still ate it and it was tasty but I learned my lesson, medium for burgers, medium rare for steaks. END
BEGIN NOW   I added the house cured bacon and some cheddar cheese to my burger and that put it @ $20. END
BEGIN NOW   The $20 burger was served with some house made kennebec potato chips, it would have cost $4 more to substitute fries. END
BEGIN NOW  Price was my major gripe at this place (besides the uber rare meat), our bill was over $60 for the 2 of us and I had a burger! I'm not from the area so when I come back to town I will likely not return but it's worth trying at least once. END
BEGIN NOW  First time here for brunch, heard it was good but no expectations. END
BEGIN NOW   We started with the Wasabi Bloody Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not a big Bloody Mary person but these totally hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Just the right level of heat and spice. END
BEGIN NOW  Then the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW   You know when you have a bite of food and everyone goes quiet and looks at each other? Especially with a group that is usually not quiet? And then the conversation shifts to "What would be your last meal?" because the plate in front of you is now in the running? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   Get the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh God and then the main course. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the fried chicken with the sausage gravy on the side, poached eggs, biscuit and (mostly decorative) fruit and salad. END
BEGIN NOW   This is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW   And the gravy with the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW   Ugh. END
BEGIN NOW   I am still thinking about it 3 days later. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   Took a while to get our food, especially considering the place was mostly empty on a late Saturday afternoon, but I guess you can't rush perfection. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW  Any bar/restaurant that offers happy hour on a Saturday has a very, very special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW   Especially when their happy hour menu includes $7 cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Our bartender made the most amazing whiskey sours - he put egg white in them, so they were frothy and almost creamy. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is ah-mazing too. END
BEGIN NOW   Holy crap, this is a f*cking good hamburger. END
BEGIN NOW   The patty is so, so juicy and you can really taste that it's freshly made because the meat just crumbles in juicy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW   Fries are thick and soft and they give you this tangy orange aioli to dip them in. END
BEGIN NOW   It paired reallllly well with our whiskey sours. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is old-timey and incredibly charming. END
BEGIN NOW   Hopscotch has a second, disconnected room over from Subway (can we just get rid of the Subway?!) that we were seated in. END
BEGIN NOW   One entire wall is a cream-colored tufted leather booth. END
BEGIN NOW   It feels like something out of the golden age of jazz. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is remarkably friendly and made for a very comfortable experience. END
BEGIN NOW   Love love love Hopscotch. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh hey, you can get a bucket of fried chicken to-go too :). END
BEGIN NOW  A friend who knows I like fried chicken said I had to come here and try their buttermilk fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    $18 for half a chicken, she said. END
BEGIN NOW    At those prices, it'd better be some chicken, I said. END
BEGIN NOW  In the first place, it isn't half a chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    (To be fair to the restaurant, they don't say it is. END
BEGIN NOW  )  It's two pieces, a boneless breast and a drumstick (not boneless), sort of melded together with a bridge of excess breading. END
BEGIN NOW    When it was served, I was told "the only bone is in the drumstick", which suggested that there might be at least a boneless thigh or a boneless wing in there somewhere, but there wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW  The breading was very crunchy and very thick. END
BEGIN NOW    It had an interesting seasoning, that was its best point. END
BEGIN NOW    It was quite tolerable with the thick, not particularly moist breast meat. END
BEGIN NOW    Once I'd eaten that, though, the breading became overwhelming, and I was glad there wasn't any more. END
BEGIN NOW  After leaving here, I drove up Telegraph and went past a Church's, and I thought: I could have gotten twice as much fried chicken, just as good and with less heavy breading, for half as much money, if I'd gone here instead. END
BEGIN NOW  One of the rare times my wife and I agreed that a restaurant was 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the burger. END
BEGIN NOW   It was perfectly done, juicy, and tasted amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   One of the best burgers I've had. END
BEGIN NOW   It was worth the $14. END
BEGIN NOW  My wife had the ribs, which she loved. END
BEGIN NOW   The meat came off the bone very easily, and the sauce was quite flavorful (and a bit smokey, which she liked). END
BEGIN NOW   She was also very happy with the cocktail she had (an interesting tropical and smokey flavor combo). END
BEGIN NOW  We also really enjoyed the mud pie. END
BEGIN NOW  No complaints!. END
BEGIN NOW  Food to die for and a counter to die at. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch could be wonderful, but you can't eat comfortably at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW   The stools have no foot rest and you get a climbing Halfdome experience clinging to the 2 inch rail the provide. END
BEGIN NOW  NOTE TO READER: Before I get my head chopped off by other yelpers. END
BEGIN NOW   (This has happened before) I am about to go on a 14 hour flight, out of the country. END
BEGIN NOW   During this flight I have nothing to do and I know I have slacked on my reviewing because I have been crazy busy! Although every time I have gone somewhere new I made it a point to check-in so I may go back and review later. END
BEGIN NOW   It has taken me a while to review these restaurants but I am finally doing so. END
BEGIN NOW   Before somebody says "you posted x9843058048 reviews in one day", please know that I am reviewing as my flight is in the air and will be posting once landed at my destination. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank you! Also, I review on trip advisor before anybody goes psycho crazy on me saying they seen this review elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW   I post on both yelp and trip advisor of my reviews! Thank you (:. END
BEGIN NOW  Location: Downtown Oakland, street parking!. END
BEGIN NOW  Customer Service: Fast and welcoming!. END
BEGIN NOW  Decor: Small restaurant but cutesy atmosphere, we sat at the table top seating where the small bar is at. END
BEGIN NOW  Presentation of Food: ---. END
BEGIN NOW  How did the food taste?: FIRST BASE BURGER WITH GRIDDLED BEEF TONGUE. END
BEGIN NOW   That's all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW   AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall Experience: Good!. END
BEGIN NOW  Would I Come Back?: Yes!! Hell Yes!. END
BEGIN NOW  When my daughter flew in from Orlando, she was hungry. END
BEGIN NOW    So, we decided to eat something small. END
BEGIN NOW    Hence, we came to Oakland Grill. END
BEGIN NOW    We were here a few times, but I never got a chance to write a review until now. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the waffle with 2 eggs, and 2 bacons. END
BEGIN NOW    When they brought the plate, it was a large portion. END
BEGIN NOW    Good side for 2 people. END
BEGIN NOW    My daughter and I shared a plate. END
BEGIN NOW  The food wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW    Can't really go wrong with breakfast, unless it's Dennys. END
BEGIN NOW    For the most part, it was good. END
BEGIN NOW    I like their service. END
BEGIN NOW    Very friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambience wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW    It can get very busy during the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW    Be prepare for it. END
BEGIN NOW  Rating:. END
BEGIN NOW  Food:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Service:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Price:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Ambience:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  I would come back over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW  We got lucky with parking for a Sunday but we did look for around 10 mins. END
BEGIN NOW  Wait was super quick for a Sunday at 11:30, the guy who seated us was awesome!. END
BEGIN NOW  Get to a cute table, given menus. END
BEGIN NOW  Waitress comes and is stank in the face, I can tell this will be fun, no hello, no nothing, just :. END
BEGIN NOW  "What would you like? ". END
BEGIN NOW  The food was expensive for what it is but hey that's trendy Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  I would have at least had an egg that was cooked to order. END
BEGIN NOW   ( picture added ). END
BEGIN NOW  I got attitude for being allergic to pineapple, had no idea pancakes come with a side of fruit as it's not mentioned on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sad! My boyfriend loves Eggs Benny and his would have been really easy place to help him get his fix. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes! Family could not stop telling me about the crab cakes, and they were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    Serving size here is stupendous. END
BEGIN NOW    Staff here is really nice, and our waitress was so attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  We split the crab cake benedict and pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW    The apple sausage is worth trying. END
BEGIN NOW  I love a breakfast place like this. END
BEGIN NOW    The atmosphere is just relaxed and warm. END
BEGIN NOW  I came with a bigger group of 6 and had about a 25 minute wait which is a lot faster than I thought it would be considering the large crowd of people standing outside of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the chef's eggs Benedict which I was really excited about from the reviews, but sadly it just fell short. END
BEGIN NOW   The eggs itself were cooked perfectly and the side potatoes were well seasoned and quite tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Aside from that everything else was quite disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW   The sausage wasn't very tasty and the sauce was too overpowering and made the toasted English muffin soggy and hard to cut through. END
BEGIN NOW   Though I was starving coming in I barely could finish half the meal. END
BEGIN NOW  Taking a bite of the cob salad, I wish I would have gotten that because the crispy bacon and the fresh lettuce mixed with the well seasoned chicken (which was a hair dry) was worlds better than what I had. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, aside from the great customer service this place was just meh and I probably would check out another breakfast place next time. END
BEGIN NOW  GREAT BRUNCH SPOT! Generous portions, and their potato hash is bomb! It has a subtle spiciness to it. END
BEGIN NOW   The side of potatoes comes with your entree, or it's 3. END
BEGIN NOW  99$ as a side. END
BEGIN NOW   We ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict, which was on their special. END
BEGIN NOW   It had heaping servings of crab, a great creamy hollandaise sauce on top and a great portion of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   For 1. END
BEGIN NOW  99$, you can substitute your toast with a pancake. END
BEGIN NOW  We also ordered the turkey/avocado/bacon Benedict, also on their special. END
BEGIN NOW   The combo was amazing and the poached egg was nice & drippy when I poked into it. END
BEGIN NOW  Great spot, service was friendly & atmosphere was inviting. END
BEGIN NOW   Will definitely come back !. END
BEGIN NOW  Jack London Square was fairly empty on Monday around 11:30 am. END
BEGIN NOW   Assuming that it was a weekday and no one around, we thought the Oakland Grill wouldn't have much people. END
BEGIN NOW   But I guess everyone that didn't have work also decided to go to Oakland grill. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty packed, we came in and snagged the last table. END
BEGIN NOW  CRAB CAKE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW  99. END
BEGIN NOW  SUPER FRIED. END
BEGIN NOW   but it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW   [Crab cake+Poached egg + hollandaise sauce+English muffin]. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend preferred the blackstone Benedict, he said the crab and was too heavy and too fried for him. END
BEGIN NOW   All of the benedicts come with seasoned potatoes with a dollop of sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW   I Put the sour cream on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   Also comes with two small slices of fruit. END
BEGIN NOW  BLACKSTONE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW  99. END
BEGIN NOW  [bacon+tomato+hollandaise sauce+English muffin] totally preferred the crab cake. END
BEGIN NOW   The way they made the eggs though wasn't as runny as we all thought it would be. END
BEGIN NOW   This one was okay to me, but my friends loved this one way more. END
BEGIN NOW  STRAWBERRY MIMOSA: $3. END
BEGIN NOW  99. END
BEGIN NOW  Pretty small glass. END
BEGIN NOW   I totally thought it was strawberry + mimosa (OJ + Champagne) but it was actually strawberry + champagne. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Wish the flavor was more crispy C like a chilled glass or something. END
BEGIN NOW  ORANGE JUICE: $4. END
BEGIN NOW  50. END
BEGIN NOW  Freshly squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW   No pulp. END
BEGIN NOW   A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW   Small glass. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely a good find. END
BEGIN NOW   Would come again. END
BEGIN NOW   Has the ambience of a Denny's diner. END
BEGIN NOW   Also has an upstairs for dining. END
BEGIN NOW  This was a cool little place my work group visited while out on a team building trip. END
BEGIN NOW   The location is in an area where there's a lot of wholesale produce traffic, so be forewarned that not only is parking bad, but be mindful of fast moving forklifts hauling produce. END
BEGIN NOW  The restaurant has a lot of charm. END
BEGIN NOW   The kind of charm that says "established" and unpretentious. END
BEGIN NOW    My coworker set up the whole affair and had their staff arrange a large table for us. END
BEGIN NOW   While a few of my coworkers were late, they cheerfully filled our water glasses and coffee mugs without rushing us or giving us the impatient looks. END
BEGIN NOW   Granted it wasn't busy, but you all have been there. END
BEGIN NOW  After having four cups of coffee, I had the applewood smoked sausage with eggs and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW   It was quite filling and I only finished about more than half. END
BEGIN NOW   In my opinion the apple sausage was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but was still pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   There was a heaping portion of hash browns which was done right and not swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was really good, they really took good care of us. END
BEGIN NOW  I seriously doubt I'll venture here again as it's pretty far from where I live and parking is typical Oakland, but if someone invited me, I'd cheerfully meet them there. END
BEGIN NOW  Lipstick stains on my coffee cup, potatoes didn't have the sour cream I asked for, an item that was not mine was added to my bill, and the poached egg on my benedict was fully cooked and didn't run at all! That's the whole point of the benedict! All of this and I couldn't even find my server to ask for these things to be fixed until my date was finished with their food. END
BEGIN NOW   Super bummer. END
BEGIN NOW   The only reason I gave a second star was that I've been here before and had a better experience. END
BEGIN NOW   This was pretty disappointing though. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland Grill will definitely satisfy your breakfast needs for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    Located in downtown Oakland, it serves breakfast all day for those late risers. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the Lox Benedict (smoked salmon) with a side of potatoes and a few strawberry mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW    It was tasty, hearty, and the portion was huge. END
BEGIN NOW   The mimosas was mostly champagne, so don't worry about being skimped. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   The only downside is my smoked salmon was topped with warm hollandaise sauce that lightly cooked the salmon (I like mine raw). END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe I should've ordered it on the side next time. END
BEGIN NOW  Go with the Benedict, they're most popular dish. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland Grill is my solution to my Jersey diner. END
BEGIN NOW  * They serve their menu all day (yes, breakfast anytime), they're pretty much always busy on the weekends, the food is hearty and reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been both for weekday lunch and a Sunday brunch and both did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW   Lunch was much calmer; we walked right in like we owned the place. END
BEGIN NOW   My chicken and black beans was so large, I failed to clean my plate. END
BEGIN NOW   It was also healthy (yay!), filled with grilled chicken, black beans, fresh salsa, corn tortillas, a side salad and what seemed to be a half avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   It's so nice to be able to order fresh food at a casual eatery like this. END
BEGIN NOW  This past weekend's meal wasn't quite so healthy. END
BEGIN NOW   I indulged in the veggie benedict with hollandaise on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   Not the most adventurous order, but definitely a solid one! The perfectly poached eggs topped on an english muffin with grilled tomatoes and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   My one complaint? I think they could step it up on their english muffin game. END
BEGIN NOW   Change it up maybe? Higher quality muffins? Still wonderful, but it could have used a lil' something. END
BEGIN NOW  Most breakfasts come with what seems to be a pound of breakfast potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Although the b'fast potatoes are solid, I prefer mine extra crispy (which I'll request for next time), as these were a bit more mushy. END
BEGIN NOW   The fresh fruit slices are such a great touch and this fruit was perfectly ripe!. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee is dece, nothing gourmet and I spied a strawberry mimosa that was going like hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is on point with water glasses always filled and quick service. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, a solid neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure if I'd wait an hour to grub, but definitely worth a 20 minute wait as the direct 'hood can be a bit sparse for brunching options, especially on a Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW  * There are more diners per capita in Jersey than anywhere else in the world! Boo ya! #Themoreyouknow. END
BEGIN NOW  Decent neighborhood establishment with all the usual items you'd expect for brunch, whether omelets, scrambles, benedicts, and other egg-heavy dishes; or lunch, such as salads, sandwiches, and burgers. END
BEGIN NOW   Anything you can get here is going to be pretty dependable and well-portioned for the price. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is reasonably friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall, a perfectly decent experience that might not pack a lot of "wow" punches but is nevertheless dependable. END
BEGIN NOW  Stopped in here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and it was pretty packed but they seated us within 5 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   We ordered the eggs vocal stone which was like an eggs Benedict but with bacon and tomatoes instead of Canadian bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   The hollandaise sauce was amazing and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   My fiancé also had a pancake which was super fluffy and the portions were great. END
BEGIN NOW   Would definitely eat here again. END
BEGIN NOW  One of my favorite brunch spots! Especially since they serve breakfast ALL DAY!. END
BEGIN NOW  Its usually busy but you get seat right away almost all the time! Once you walk in, always get greeted by someone who's working. END
BEGIN NOW  I usually order the Eggs Benedict and you always get a choice to have fruits or potatoes on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   They always have the freshest fruits available and if you have a specific fruit you only want, they will be happy to accommodate you. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried the potatoes too and they were equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The server always comes  by to fill your water cup without you having to ask. END
BEGIN NOW   They constantly come by to check up on your table. END
BEGIN NOW   Everyone is always extremely friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  My favourite brunch spot in Oakland hands down. END
BEGIN NOW   Recommended by my grandma who would frequently come here during her conferences back in the day and whose advice I take to heart. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm a creature of habit so I always order the crab cake Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW  loved it the first time and every time since. END
BEGIN NOW   Their food is Always bomb and just made with lots love. END
BEGIN NOW  The spot is hidden, near a produce area, lots of parking outside. END
BEGIN NOW   It has 2 levels, downstairs with booths or upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW   Excellent cooks behind those grills, and friendly servers. END
BEGIN NOW   A must whilst in Oakland!!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is in such a hidden area (near all the meat packaging/wholesale warehouses). END
BEGIN NOW   I love it regardless though!. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW  I got one of the Benedict and can't remember which one but I've never been a fan of crab cake or ham so I asked if I could replace it with a sausage patty and they were able to accommodate me! The one thing I look forward to in eating eggs benedict is the yolk that comes out of it, and for both my visits the yolk came gushing out, YES!. END
BEGIN NOW  SERVICE:. END
BEGIN NOW  The servers have always been super nice. END
BEGIN NOW   I've never had a bad encounter with any of them. END
BEGIN NOW   Super friendly, and I'm glad they're able to substitute. END
BEGIN NOW  PARKING:. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking is on the street, & it is meter parking, unless you park like 2 blocks away for 2 hour free parking. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious eggs benedict and $3 mimosas? Yes please!. END
BEGIN NOW  Arrived here for the usual Sunday brunch ritual after getting frustrated and not finding any bottomless mimosa spots that served past 2 pm. END
BEGIN NOW   We settled for this spot when we noticed how nicely priced their mimosas were. END
BEGIN NOW   It was of course incredibly busy since it was Sunday brunch hours and but we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW   Our server was incredibly kind and it being our first time was very information and willingly gave us her recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend went with the burger and I opted for the eggs benedict after eyeing it up at our neighbor's table. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm sure the crab benedict is the more popular option, but oddly enough I'm not the biggest fan of crab. END
BEGIN NOW   Two rounds of mimosas in and our food arrived. END
BEGIN NOW   It looked AMAZING first off, and the taste matched its appearances. END
BEGIN NOW   The eggs were basically orgasmic. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfectly cooked and explosive with all that delicious yolk. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes that came on the side were freaking delicious as well! So packed full of different type of herbs, flavors, and you can tell that the cooks had scraped all of the good stuff off of the pan (hey, that's where all the flavor is, right?) to garnish the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   I was in heaven, and so incredibly happy by the time the meal was done. END
BEGIN NOW  I do wish they had bottomless mimosas and chicken and waffles, but those are just my own selfish desires. END
BEGIN NOW   Other than that, I will certainly return!. END
BEGIN NOW  Great everything!  Seriously. END
BEGIN NOW    I had never tried Red Bay Coffee before this- two thumbs up!  Plus it's roasted in Oakland- I love that!. END
BEGIN NOW  I first tried the oatmeal and went for sweet- adding bananas, brown sugar and yogurt. END
BEGIN NOW    Delicious!  However, the polenta- oh the polenta!  I get it with caramelized red onions, fresh green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and sea salt. END
BEGIN NOW    Filling, nutritious and absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  It was all so good that I had to go back and try their donut happy hour- HOLY COW!!. END
BEGIN NOW  Top that all off with a fantastic mission- " job creation and leadership training for girls in Oakland who face significant barriers to employment," this is definitely a favorite spot now. END
BEGIN NOW    I highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW  Mamacitas Cafe is small, just a serving counter on the left. END
BEGIN NOW   and some lounge seats to the right. END
BEGIN NOW  another room has tables for laptopers. END
BEGIN NOW   not sure if it's connected to the Cafe or not. END
BEGIN NOW  eats: oats or polenta(grits)  choose polenta (12 oz 6. END
BEGIN NOW  95). END
BEGIN NOW  -choice of many toppings and seasonings. END
BEGIN NOW  -roasted tomatos, zuchinni, sea salt, green onions was my choices. END
BEGIN NOW  -delicious! never thought i would like grits. END
BEGIN NOW  brew: red bay coffee (3). END
BEGIN NOW  -bold, herby taste. END
BEGIN NOW  -definitely unique. END
BEGIN NOW  drips:. END
BEGIN NOW  -parking difficult in this area. END
BEGIN NOW  -quick service with smiles. END
BEGIN NOW  -menu limited to 2 offerings, maybe more in the morning?. END
BEGIN NOW  In a world overrun with Starbucks, Peet's and Keurig machines that you have to decalcify every 2 minutes (you don't know my struggle so you don't feel my hustle!), a good cup of coffee has become a luxury that too many of us don't get too experience often enough. END
BEGIN NOW   But look no further! Sip on without the shame of knowing your joe was sourced by underpaid laborers and upheld by unfair labor practices! Dunk a delicious donut hole in that cup and know that pastry was made with wholehearted love and passion by women who support fair business practices and use their small business to uplift their community!. END
BEGIN NOW  I love everything about Mamacita's, and please believe that the coffee, lavender lemonade and yummy donut kebabs are just the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW   The owners, Shana and Renee, grind super hard for theirs and employ and educate young women in high school on the ins and outs of business ownership along the way by offering opportunities to keep kids occupied and focused. END
BEGIN NOW   They serve up Red Bay Coffee, keeping it fresh, local and delicious while giving back to the hood whenever they can. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't praise them enough!. END
BEGIN NOW  My fiancée and I first heard word of Mamacitas Café in the East Bay Express over the summer and appreciated their mission. END
BEGIN NOW   Then when looking for a vendor for our post-wedding picnic they came immediately to mind. END
BEGIN NOW   It was easy as pie to get in touch with them and then for a very fair price they served a lovely selection of their amazing donut kebabs to our assembled guests. END
BEGIN NOW  They were there on time, supplied all the gear they needed, and ran a well organized operation. END
BEGIN NOW  Both the sweet and savory options were a big hit, along with the hot coffee, iced coffee, iced tea, and lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW   I would recommend them to anyone looking for a dessert or coffee vendor. END
BEGIN NOW  I sat with a group of 4. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything was tasty and the service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   They were more than accommodating for our 8 month son. END
BEGIN NOW  We shared a chicken and waffle, which was very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   The waffle reminds me of a doughnut and the chicken has a perfectly crispy battery. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the vegetable hash and everything was cooked just right: nothing soggy or greasy. END
BEGIN NOW   The red chile sauce was a great compliment to the greens. END
BEGIN NOW  Long wait. END
BEGIN NOW    That's to be expected though. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the waffle with fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    The waffle was better than average but the chicken wasn't great. END
BEGIN NOW    They use chicken breast, which is indisputably the worst cut of meat on the bird. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a tasteless, fat-less cut. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a reason fried chicken joints serve legs and wings. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a mixed review regarding the food and the atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    Had the Thursday before Memorial Day off and the choice of Oakland eateries were Mama's  Royal Cafe (a standard on any day of hookie) and Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW    So I choose to pay Auntie a visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Service: On point, coffee DELICIOUS!!!  Whatever the jam was. END
BEGIN NOW  YAASS!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  The not so great. END
BEGIN NOW   The noise level in this place is deafening. END
BEGIN NOW    It was about 11 am and not crowed, but steady. END
BEGIN NOW    Restaurants of today have zero noise cancellation and given the open space, closeness of the kitchen and lots of wood decor the sound is to the point of painful. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash with Poached Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW    I know my corned beef and this was a miss. END
BEGIN NOW    Very little meat and a whole lot of deconstructed cabbage and peppers. END
BEGIN NOW    Nothing was together. END
BEGIN NOW    It was like a tiny bit of meat topped with cabbage, onions, some potatoes and the topped with the eggs that were not poached well (running whites). END
BEGIN NOW    Homemade rye bread was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  My last put off was this little note card that explained about the "surcharge". END
BEGIN NOW    Auntie charges a 15% surcharge to help pay for the entire staff. END
BEGIN NOW    You may also leave and additional amount that will go directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW    And like a good Aunt, she has broken down what the extra 3% or 5% for your server would be. END
BEGIN NOW    You read this coming into the restaurant, you read it again at the table and on your tab. END
BEGIN NOW  The cost of doing business is just that. END
BEGIN NOW    Whatever you have to pay to keep your place staffed well should be built into the cost of your meals, not let the patron work on supplementing your payroll. END
BEGIN NOW    What will we see next?  PG&E goes up on gas so there is another surcharge to read about if we want hot food or to see the food on the table?. END
BEGIN NOW  So, I will not return to Aunt Mary's, and I will instead go visit Mama's. END
BEGIN NOW  like everyone should. END
BEGIN NOW  We went here with an open mind, but was disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW   Food and service were WAY below average. END
BEGIN NOW   And what's up with this 15% mandatory tip? I don't buy this argument that since kitchen staff are making min wage then charge customers more to help the kitchen staff. END
BEGIN NOW   Really? If the owner really cares for his employees, why pay them min wage? Give them a raise man. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't ask customers to compensate for your lack of humanity. END
BEGIN NOW   Total BS. END
BEGIN NOW   We will never go back here and will not recommend it to anyone. END
BEGIN NOW  Now here are just 2 examples of the shortfalls regarding the food:. END
BEGIN NOW  (1) $15 for 2 hard pancakes with fake cherry jam. END
BEGIN NOW   Really? For the sake of comparison: Bette's diner has the BEST pancakes; price for 2 is $6. END
BEGIN NOW  75 (same size). END
BEGIN NOW   It comes with butter and syrup (and not attitude). END
BEGIN NOW   Who would pay twice as much money for lower quality food/service?. END
BEGIN NOW  (2) my poached eggs where raw yuk. END
BEGIN NOW   It's not very hard to make poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   Believe me, just Google it and you'll learn. END
BEGIN NOW  I think people who give this place 5 starts should really get out more often. END
BEGIN NOW   Try other breakfast places. END
BEGIN NOW   Any place is better than this (Yes even Denny's). END
BEGIN NOW   The entire experience was way below average. END
BEGIN NOW   The only bright side was my lovely company. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had Aunt Mary's bookmarked for sooo long it moved to a new location hahah! (Not far. END
BEGIN NOW  only a few blocks down!). END
BEGIN NOW  After my experience, I can see why so many people rave about it. END
BEGIN NOW   It's super casual with generous portions. END
BEGIN NOW   Prices are not cheap here, but you are paying for good quality dishes. END
BEGIN NOW   (Kid friendly too - there's toys and books in the waiting area). END
BEGIN NOW  Our party of 7 didn't have to wait long early on a Saturday morning (around 9am). END
BEGIN NOW   I put my name down at the front & was told they have a special room upstairs for large parties. END
BEGIN NOW   (I believe your party has to be complete before they will seat you though) We felt like VIPs since we had the whole space to ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW   There was even a bathroom upstairs and couches! KUDOS to our wonderful server to made the endless treks up and down the stairs bringing our food, clearing our plates, refilling our coffee, and checking on us periodically. END
BEGIN NOW  I really liked my Southern Bubble and Squeak dish (what a cool name :D) It's basically like gravy, eggs, and mashed potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  simple enough but it was really tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Another memorable dish in the party was Huevos Benedictos but it was way spicer than it looked. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, I was really impressed with the side of pancake ($1. END
BEGIN NOW  75) that came with the Basic Eggs & 2 Sides - so gigantic!. END
BEGIN NOW  They were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives but unfortunately I didn't get to try the Pain Perdue this particular visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Yelp pics look amazing though - can't wait to go back for brunch again to try it!! (Only served during weekend brunch). END
BEGIN NOW  This is definitely a neighborhood gem and worth a visit if you are in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW  Tips: Large parties of 8 or more can call to make reservations before 9am. END
BEGIN NOW   15% auto tip charge on all bills. END
BEGIN NOW   No dinner service. END
BEGIN NOW   No TOGO orders on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW  You know when you walk into a place and it just reminds you of a little piece of your past? That happened for me at Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't pinpoint what, but walking in on a later afternoon weekday, to a spacious and airy place, a kind hello and people thoroughly enjoying their food, I knew I was in for a treat. END
BEGIN NOW   A little bit country, a little bit Oakland, this diner is serving up comfort food all day, every day. END
BEGIN NOW   No dinner service here, but they make up for it by offering breakfast until their 3pm closing. END
BEGIN NOW  I can see this place being a shit show on weekend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Be patient. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're like me and can enjoy a leisurely weekday meal, as always I suggest that. END
BEGIN NOW   I went with the chilaquiles asking for the two accompanying eggs poached and an iced tea and got to using their free wifi. END
BEGIN NOW  The iced tea was a bucket. END
BEGIN NOW   Straight up the largest mason jar filled with unsweetened iced tea. END
BEGIN NOW   No need for refills, since I mean, there is so much dang liquid. END
BEGIN NOW   Smart. END
BEGIN NOW  The chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW   Not like the one from your local taqueria. END
BEGIN NOW   Lacking in elbow grease from an abuela, they were still a treat for the senses. END
BEGIN NOW   The fried tortilla chips perfectly soft, yet still had a hint of crisp served a pretty perfect bed for the eggs, pico, black beans and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   The side tortillas were even a bit of an overkill. END
BEGIN NOW   The hint of heat from the verde salsa really rounded up this dish. END
BEGIN NOW  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW   15% gratuity is included and divided amongst all staff and you can choose to give more which goes directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm ok with that. END
BEGIN NOW   My one small gripe? This isn't a cheap endeavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Lunch was around $18, not the cheapest meal you've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back mainly to try more on the menu, especially the hangtown fry-tatta: a frittata with bacon and spinach, topped with fried oysters and fennel slices, drizzled with Rockefeller sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   Yep. END
BEGIN NOW   That's the truth right there. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back, for sure. END
BEGIN NOW  Their BLT is the best sandwich I have ever eaten, and I am not a sandwich person. END
BEGIN NOW   It's the XL bacon strips and spicy aioli generously spread in between the toasty, buttered sandwich bread with crunchy, fresh lettuce that will make you return for this. END
BEGIN NOW  Served with a fresh, green salad NOT overdressed with vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW  The other must-try is their oyster po-boy. END
BEGIN NOW   It's fried to crispy deliciousness. END
BEGIN NOW   I love their refillable iced tea and my husband loves their lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW  Extremely family friendly - They have high chairs and mommas often come here so you're likely to see a breastfeeding mom or two who'll understand if your kiddo has a meltdown. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure if the bathroom has a changing room. END
BEGIN NOW  Call ahead for pick-up if you'd like. END
BEGIN NOW   Tips are automatically included and split among front and back of house staff. END
BEGIN NOW  I love this place, I'll be back, and if there's anything bad to be said - it's that the food's so good, it's a popular spot so expect to wait a little to eat, but be rest assured that your taste buds will be excited and you'll remember your meal and be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW  I really like the food here. END
BEGIN NOW   The oyster po'boy is especially good. END
BEGIN NOW   Stopped going due to this 15% surcharge business. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't want to feel pressured to leave a tip on top of a forced tip -- which is really what it is, regardless of what they choose to call it. END
BEGIN NOW   Check out the card I found on the table the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW   (Sorry, but Yelp does not have a "rotate" function!). END
BEGIN NOW  I have always been a good tipper, and very forgiving of problems that are out of the server's control, so it's not the amount that turns me off, rather the principle. END
BEGIN NOW  Sad, because the food is good, though it is a little high, and perhaps that's why they couldn't just up the food prices rather than institute the surcharge. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm always exploring breakfast and brunch places in Oakland and, given the reviews I had read, I was highly anticipating a great breakfast/brunch here. END
BEGIN NOW   While everything started great, it was just went downhill from there and I walked out very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  First, the good stuff: It was very busy, but I was still promptly greeted by hostess who handed me the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW   When she saw I was jus one person, she offered me a seat at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW   Once there, I was promptly attended to by a smiling and friendly server, Sasha, who took coffee order and was patient with me while I decided what I wanted for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   My meal, the huevos benedictos, was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   The sauce, not hollandaise, was very spicy, which is great with me! Up until the time Sasha checked on how I liked my meal, she was five stars all the way. END
BEGIN NOW  What went wrong?. END
BEGIN NOW  A few minutes after I was seated, a second hostess came up to me and said that there was a waiting list, implying that I "cut" in front of everybody on the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW   I told her I tried to get on the list, but another hostess offered me the counter. END
BEGIN NOW   She wanted to know who that was and then she walked away and never said another word to me. END
BEGIN NOW   She was very polite and professional, but I found the encounter offensive, partly because she never apologized. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, she should have checked with the other hostesses before confronting with me. END
BEGIN NOW  The other issues were minor. END
BEGIN NOW   My server never offered to refill my coffee, I had to ask twice. END
BEGIN NOW   She dropped off my bill with a polite comment and was gone before I could say anything to her - without ever asking me if I wanted anything else, which I did. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is as important to me as the food and this was a bad experience, primarily because of the second hostess, not the server. END
BEGIN NOW   Because the food was good, I may try it again someday. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for brunch once with my sister, dad and niece. END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone seemed to like their food, including my picky 3-year-old niece. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the Grilled Flank Steak Sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW   The flavors were great, but my meat was so tough!!!!! It was so awkward to eat because I couldn't rip off a piece and all of it would just come flying out of the bread. END
BEGIN NOW   If the steak wasn't so hard, this sandwich would've been amazing and would've changed how many stars I'm giving this place. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried my sister's catfish sandwich and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Should have gotten that. END
BEGIN NOW  They have an interesting and unique menu which makes me want to come back and try some more. END
BEGIN NOW  After receiving a recommendation of this spot from a co worker, we decided to check it out as we were still looking out for a signature breakfast spot in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW    We came here for Sunday brunch and found ourselves only waiting for about  15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW    We ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW  Lemon ricotta cornmeal pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW  Side of spicy pork sausage. END
BEGIN NOW  Pain perdu. END
BEGIN NOW  Sadly, everything was no more than mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW    The sauce that was served with the pancakes was crazy overpowering. END
BEGIN NOW    It would have been better served without. END
BEGIN NOW    The pancakes, alone, tasted great. END
BEGIN NOW  The homemade sausage, while I appreciated it, was overcooked and dry. END
BEGIN NOW  The whiskey pain perdu fell short. END
BEGIN NOW    After a bite or two, I was over it. END
BEGIN NOW    It looked better than it tasted. END
BEGIN NOW  Service also fell short. END
BEGIN NOW    It was difficult to find someone to ask for our check or get a refill on water and coffee. END
BEGIN NOW    3 stars at most. END
BEGIN NOW  I have to say im only judging off my food experience here. END
BEGIN NOW   I was with a table of 5 and everyone agreed my food was definitely the worst. END
BEGIN NOW   So. END
BEGIN NOW  The bisquits and gravy taste more like bisquit and paste. END
BEGIN NOW   A paste that gives a hint of glue. END
BEGIN NOW  No salt added whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean NONE. END
BEGIN NOW   Possibly the blandest biscuit and gravy I've ever witnessed. END
BEGIN NOW   So much for being whisked away to my childhood. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   No. END
BEGIN NOW  $15 for that atrocity. END
BEGIN NOW  I tasted the waffle of my friends. END
BEGIN NOW   On point. END
BEGIN NOW   Chicken was good too. END
BEGIN NOW  The fried oysters-doable. END
BEGIN NOW  Minus 1 star for having a menu that actually says  "maple flavored syrup" or actual "maple syrup" for $3. END
BEGIN NOW   Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  no. END
BEGIN NOW   Just serve maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was just ok too. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean I probably wouldnt go back but it's worth a try if your in the area. END
BEGIN NOW  Aunt Mary's is a solid place for breakfast and brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    Although their specialty items are a little more expensive, they're pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW    I enjoyed the posole verde. END
BEGIN NOW    Good pancakes too. END
BEGIN NOW    I didn't like the chicken fried steak too much, I thought the meat was a little rubbery, but the chile sauce on top was good. END
BEGIN NOW    Ingredients are fresh and portions are generous. END
BEGIN NOW  Amazing food and service. END
BEGIN NOW     I saw this place on Diners and Dives and was sold when they showed how to make Shrimp and Grits. END
BEGIN NOW     After visiting our daughter on Mothers day weekend, we got up early to avoid the breakfast rush. END
BEGIN NOW    They opened at 8:00. END
BEGIN NOW    We were greeted and asked to sit where we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW    This area and restaurant setting reminded us of Portland, Oregon. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved it. END
BEGIN NOW    I of course had to try the Shrimp and Grits, which was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    We watched other food pass by and everything looked amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    You must try Aunt Mary's!. END
BEGIN NOW  I have many happy memories of this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Great appetizers and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    They have $1 oysters for happy hour and they are always fresh and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   They serve a lot of cool condiments with them that are fun to try and are taste tantalizing. END
BEGIN NOW   If you never had raw oysters before, this is a good place to try it first, because they are small and mild. END
BEGIN NOW   I also highly recommend their deviled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   I am not crazy about their chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW  that is one dish I would not recommend. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a large selection of wines and the waiters really know what their stuff in case you need help choosing the right drink for your mood. END
BEGIN NOW   No matter how busy they get I've never had an issue with the wait staff and we always were able to get a seat somehow, though we usually get there early. END
BEGIN NOW  Where do I start? I had a detailed review in my head but then realized it was long and would have been a rant, so I will just give pluses and minuses and be brief. END
BEGIN NOW  Started out as a nice warm Oakland evening at the beginning of a three day weekend and looking forward to relaxing with great food and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks, yes, they were great: sidecar and petit pomme. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice wine list too. END
BEGIN NOW  Started with the roasted cauliflower and baby kale to share. END
BEGIN NOW   The cauliflower was not cooked, and the dish was barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW   Server said it was not intended to be hot. END
BEGIN NOW   We took two bites of raw cauliflower, and she took it away-not going to eat raw cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW   The sauce was rather bland as well. END
BEGIN NOW   Very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  Next came our steak and sliders. END
BEGIN NOW   The sliders they got right although the buns were a little dry. END
BEGIN NOW   I could easily overlook this. END
BEGIN NOW   The steak was cooked just right, and the sauce was good, but again the dish came to us barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW   Is this a new thing I just don't know about?  I like my food served hot from pan or grill to plate to table. END
BEGIN NOW  Our fries to share never came; we had to ask for them. END
BEGIN NOW   When they did arrive, they were great-perfectly cooked and seasoned, temp was just right, and aioli was better than most. END
BEGIN NOW   Still disappointing since we had already finished our mains. END
BEGIN NOW   Would have been nice to enjoy both at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh well. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was aloof and uneven. END
BEGIN NOW   They had a crowd but not too busy so there was no reason for delayed service. END
BEGIN NOW   If the kitchen is having timing issues, the server just didn't seem concerned. END
BEGIN NOW   I felt like we just had to take what we got with no apologies, just drop the plate at the table and run. END
BEGIN NOW   There are some nice sounding dishes on the menu I would like to try, but I don't think that will happen any time soon. END
BEGIN NOW  This is not my place; I will not return. END
BEGIN NOW  Pesto pizza, chicken wings, ceviche, wine tasting, cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   My ladies and I had a great night there sharing dinner and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  Busy lively atmosphere for late 20-30-40 somethings. END
BEGIN NOW  I would definitely recommend to others and go back for Friday night happenings. END
BEGIN NOW   The food was great and service was great!. END
BEGIN NOW  Whooooooaaaa there Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW   How have I NOT written a review for one of my favorite happy hours in the East Bay? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   I genuinely love their happy hour offerings and the food for that is also delish. END
BEGIN NOW   De. END
BEGIN NOW   Lish. END
BEGIN NOW   Umph. END
BEGIN NOW  I actually discovered District's amazing happy hour on a pub crawl. END
BEGIN NOW   Yes. END
BEGIN NOW   That have happy hour on Saturdays. END
BEGIN NOW   You're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW   So once you've had brunch, with bottomless mimosas, started to sober up, and don't want to. END
BEGIN NOW  come here. END
BEGIN NOW  The tables fill up mostly due to reservations. END
BEGIN NOW   #protip. END
BEGIN NOW  But, if you can find yourself at the bar, then go for it. END
BEGIN NOW   Minus a star because the service can be (okay, probably will be) slow. END
BEGIN NOW   But, no one is perfect right?. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu includes $6 house wine, beers, well drinks, and my favorite the food (see photo for menu). END
BEGIN NOW   $6 for 6 oysters, yes. END
BEGIN NOW   Recommendation: go with the truffle fries. END
BEGIN NOW   They are cooked to order so they are not cold. END
BEGIN NOW   They come seasoned with salt, pepper, and what I believe is Rosemary (listed as herbs and truffle Parmesan aioli), ketchup, and the dipping sauce aforementioned. END
BEGIN NOW  It's walkable from 12th street BART and then you can explore old Oakland, head to Jack London Square, or off to the Fox Theatre and Uptown. END
BEGIN NOW   I love it here and definitely recommend it for a stop along the way or a place for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  District isn't a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a wine bar with food. END
BEGIN NOW    We failed to know this. END
BEGIN NOW  Their menu consists of small plates and pizzas. END
BEGIN NOW    The bf and I ordered six dishes and that was too much. END
BEGIN NOW    Stick to about two dishes per person and you should be good. END
BEGIN NOW    If not, order as you go. END
BEGIN NOW  MUST TRY:. END
BEGIN NOW  The two standout dishes of the night were the tempura avocado and the sliced hanger steak. END
BEGIN NOW    The tempura avocado had a light and crispy exterior, topped with chili lime salt (which was phenomenal), and served with a roasted jalapeno aioli sauce for dipping. END
BEGIN NOW    The hanger steak was so tender that it melts in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW    The topping was that it was served with chimichurri sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  OTHER FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW  *The raw oysters were medium size and served with a mignonette sauce and fresh horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW    They do have $1 oysters (opposed to $2. END
BEGIN NOW  50 each) during happy hour (weekdays 4-6pm). END
BEGIN NOW  *The steak tartare was okay. END
BEGIN NOW    The bf wasn't a big fan as it was tangier than other places. END
BEGIN NOW    One of the biggest mistakes with the dish was the egg. END
BEGIN NOW    Unlike most places that serve it with a raw egg on top, District's version cooks their egg. END
BEGIN NOW    My egg was more cooked than in pictures I've seen on Yelp and lacked that yolky gooiness. END
BEGIN NOW  *The margherita pizza had a nice thin crust and was perfect for sharing. END
BEGIN NOW    It was topped with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. END
BEGIN NOW    It was good but it needed more tomatoes or tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was nice but staff was often missing so it took a long time getting what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW    There was a bit of a timing issue with food arrival. END
BEGIN NOW    The pace in the beginning was good as we had food in front of us but not to the point of taking up all table room). END
BEGIN NOW    There was so much time between the last couple dishes that food had settled and we were too full. END
BEGIN NOW  Depending on the size of your party, make a reservation on Opentable. END
BEGIN NOW    If reservations aren't made, seating is free for all which we lucked out with. END
BEGIN NOW    District has a limited number of reservations because there is a limited amount of seating. END
BEGIN NOW    Though it's a big place, most of the area is taken for bar seating and lounge areas. END
BEGIN NOW  WHAT TO KNOW:. END
BEGIN NOW  *Full bar. END
BEGIN NOW  *Take advantage of their happy hour specials from 4-6pm. END
BEGIN NOW  *Street parking or a paid lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend and I went to district to watch the warriors game last night and had a horrifying experience. END
BEGIN NOW   I asked the bartender to place a order for food and drinks, he rolled his eyes and said I'm kinda busy ( tall large white male). END
BEGIN NOW  My friend who I was with (white) went outside after the game as we waited on the bill to take a call from a Ill family member. END
BEGIN NOW   I went outside to let her know that the bill was ready. END
BEGIN NOW   The manager John ran outside in full stride after me and yelled in front of everybody outside you are banned you are banned for skipping out on your bill. END
BEGIN NOW   I explained to him I was getting her to come pay her portion but he continued to yell that I was banned. END
BEGIN NOW   We gave him our cards and proceeded to walk behind him. END
BEGIN NOW   He told the security not to let me in while he charged our cards. END
BEGIN NOW   When he returned he threw bill holder at my friend with our cards in it which fell on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW   As we checked the bill he charged us double and refused to let us back in to discuss it. END
BEGIN NOW   I have never been so disrespected at an establishment in all my life. END
BEGIN NOW  One of those rare places that does a number of things well, whether it's serving up weekend brunch, offering daily drinks and dinner, or morphing into a thumpin' hangout on late weekend nights. END
BEGIN NOW  No matter what the environment is, the ambience is friendly, casual, diverse, and welcoming in a uniquely Oakland way. END
BEGIN NOW   Brunches here, in particular, are a laid-back way of easing into your weekend day, and there's a wide array of scrumptious offerings to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW   Seems like half of Oakland is here too, all with smiling faces. END
BEGIN NOW  Can't go wrong with this place no matter the purpose. END
BEGIN NOW   Highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend wanted to try this place and I was down to because they had $1 oysters. END
BEGIN NOW    When I entered, I stood their awkwardly trying to find a waiter to seat me. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't know that you actually seat yourself. END
BEGIN NOW   (Remember this! So you don't awkwardly stand there and wait for someone to come). END
BEGIN NOW   Once we sat down, it took them awhile to come to the table. END
BEGIN NOW   The service here is extremely slow. END
BEGIN NOW   The food service is fine. END
BEGIN NOW   But grabbing the waiter's attention is extremely difficult. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried the following:. END
BEGIN NOW  Peach Bellini: it was good! But not much for $6. END
BEGIN NOW   I finished it quickly. END
BEGIN NOW   So ordered the next drink. END
BEGIN NOW  Grapefruit beer: it was delicious! I wanted to order another one but I was kind of full. END
BEGIN NOW  Oysters: they were good. END
BEGIN NOW   They waiter asked if we wanted Tabasco and I said yes but they never brought it out. END
BEGIN NOW  Chicken wings: there were 5 wings and they were a lot smaller than I expected. END
BEGIN NOW   It came out on a cute little cast iron skillet. END
BEGIN NOW   The wings were good but I didn't like the sauce it came with. END
BEGIN NOW  I would return for the food but only if I have a lot of time because of their service. END
BEGIN NOW   Parking in that area isn't difficult either so that's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW  It's really more of a 3. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars since it was slightly  over average. END
BEGIN NOW    We came here for appetizers on a Saturday night and it had a pretty good vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    Great mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW  We started with the deviled eggs to wet our appetites. END
BEGIN NOW    Creamy egg with a hint heat from the sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW    Next was the Brussel sprouts which were roasted and blended well with the cider brown butter and almonds. END
BEGIN NOW    We had them hold the pancetta since we were vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW    Last we had the fontina and spinach arancini which was on a bed of spicy tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW    All very good. END
BEGIN NOW  I think we will go back and try it for dinner next time. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW   The first time was lovely, but the second time (last night) was ruined by the female Africa American late 20s, maybe 30ish, bright pink lipstick server who seemed so annoyed by having to get us a couple of drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   All simple questions were answered with a perplexing huffiness. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't think we did anything to set her off, but it was like she hated us the minute we walked in, and there's no place for that in this business. END
BEGIN NOW   Or this world really. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartenders were great, and though we had a table we just started going to them directly to avoid her odd wrath. END
BEGIN NOW  Another plus - gorgeous art!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place was great!. END
BEGIN NOW  Le bf, me, and one of our good couple friends stumbled in here after first getting some beers at The Trappist and some nomz at the Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf was on the hunt for some oysters and he saw a sign advertising them here! Sold. END
BEGIN NOW  The sign advertised $1 oysters at happy hour which we missed (darnit!), but their normal price was $2. END
BEGIN NOW  75. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf and his friend ended up splitting a plate of about 10 oysters with a few beers between them while I got a glass of champagne and split the bread pudding with le other gf. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was great! I'm not a huge fan of oysters in general but these were fresh and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread pudding wasn't the best I've ever had but was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   Was kind of pricey but was also kind of a "scene" type place. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, we really enjoyed posting up and having a few drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW   I would definitely come back here and try more of the food! I think at happy hour (with happy hour prices), this would be a great spot I would actively seek out. END
BEGIN NOW  During my first year of working in Oakland, I would, on average, about once a week, take a lunchtime walk from our office at City Center to Jack London Square, usually approaching via Chinatown and Webster Street while returning via Old Town and Washington Street. END
BEGIN NOW   In the latter area, I've been to Pacific Coast Brewing Company a couple of times, I've glanced at the used bookstore, and have made frequent passages through Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW   Also noticed have been a handful of somewhat trendy-looking bars, just awaiting for me to make an appearance. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally, as it often happens, I wind up at a wonderful new location almost by accident. END
BEGIN NOW   A couple of weeks ago we were supposed to meet at another bar about a half block away. END
BEGIN NOW   For whatever reason, however, that location was not open when it said it would be. END
BEGIN NOW   Its loss and The District's gain. END
BEGIN NOW   Or, more precisely, our gain - we now have a reliable standby to go to after a day of putting up with the powers that be. END
BEGIN NOW   Comfy seats at right angles with room for small plates to share, the environment is just made for socializing - public but not too loud; active but with the ability to move around freely. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus the place has a good selection of brews, hard alcohol, and after work food - I recommend the shrimp pizza with chorizo, with a Raging Bitch to wash it down. END
BEGIN NOW   Even though it's not technically on the menu, our waitress complied with my request of an irish coffee, by improvising with Jamesons, and of course, coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  So, a week later, one of the bigwigs at work decided that, for whoever wanted to take him up on the offer, we should do a pubcrawl through Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   It says volumes that this crawl began and ended at The District. END
BEGIN NOW  District never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW   The food and libations are strictly top quality and the staff are very friendly for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW   The only thing on the menu that I've tried and felt "meh" about was the pesto mozzarella pizza. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty bland. END
BEGIN NOW  I also had the chance to host my birthday festivities at District. END
BEGIN NOW   Everyone in my party was treated promptly and the servers made sure my night was special. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't even have to reserve a couch, I just showed up early with part of my group. END
BEGIN NOW   The space was a little small for my party (around 23 people) but we made it work and stayed out the way (or tried to). END
BEGIN NOW  I booked a table at Bellanico's this week, looking for a restaurant that offered great, authentic Italian food, a great environment and a baby friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW    They delivered!. END
BEGIN NOW  When we arrived they had a table for four adults and a high chair ready for us, a little offset from the rest of the dining room which was much appreciated. END
BEGIN NOW    Right off the bat, our waiter was courteous, knowledgeable and professional. END
BEGIN NOW    He was present when we needed him but not overbearing - just the right balance. END
BEGIN NOW    Most importantly, he was patient with our group taking some time to reach decisions as he was with a 2-year old walking around the table non-stop. END
BEGIN NOW  Our food was outright excellent. END
BEGIN NOW    Cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned and immaculately presented. END
BEGIN NOW    The menu presents a wide array of choices to satisfy wide arrays of preferences, which we needed for our group. END
BEGIN NOW    There are many appetizers to choose from, of which many also cater well to being shared as a group. END
BEGIN NOW    In main courses, there are several pasta and non-pastas to choose from, and they all look delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW  As a trained sommelier, I was happy to see that the diversity of the menu was reflected in the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW    It's mostly Italian, and reflects all of the major wine producing areas - not a generic list of 15 different Chiantis. END
BEGIN NOW    We chose the Aglianico del Vulture which was I was happy to find - I think it's the first time I've seen it at a restaurant in California. END
BEGIN NOW    The list also has wines from France and Spain. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been looking for restaurant that has all of the above for sometime, and I am happy I found Bellanico's. END
BEGIN NOW    We will be visiting many more times. END
BEGIN NOW  Just had a very awkward exchange with the lady behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not sure if it's the way I look or was dressed but every question I had was returned with a confused look. END
BEGIN NOW   Do you accept credit for gift certificates? I thought that was a valid question because some stores only allow debit or cash payment for gift cards. END
BEGIN NOW   Can I use your phone to call my brother to make sure the gift certificate is addressed right? Another perplexed look. END
BEGIN NOW   Then I was handed the receipt where there was a section for tip, I'll chalk this one up to how the system is set up but they may want to exclude a tip section for buying a gift card. END
BEGIN NOW  -I did call after and she was much nicer but still a weird encounter. END
BEGIN NOW  I live up the street and if I was more impressed with this place, I would go more. END
BEGIN NOW   Yes, the food is really good. END
BEGIN NOW   Portions are very small. END
BEGIN NOW   If My girlfriend and I were to walk out of here with a drink and a full stomach, we wouldn't leave paying less than a $100 and that's probably without tip. END
BEGIN NOW  We've had good service here before and the food is tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Three stars for that. END
BEGIN NOW   Minus two stars for the way I was treated this past time and the small portion size and no beer on tap (I get it, it's a wine place but have at least one beer, this is California). END
BEGIN NOW  Been several times. END
BEGIN NOW   Always good. END
BEGIN NOW   Looked at menu at competitor down the street. END
BEGIN NOW   Big ass television for Warrior game. END
BEGIN NOW   No thank you. END
BEGIN NOW   That's what sports bars and living rooms are created to accommodate. END
BEGIN NOW   Italian meals are about good food, conversations, and no cell phones. END
BEGIN NOW   Went back to Bellancio-no reservation, but early for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW   Seated promptly. END
BEGIN NOW   Fried green olives - more addicting than crack. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a Negroni and an Aperol spritz ( my wife) Great wine from Montalcatino. END
BEGIN NOW   Best pork chop ever! Service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  Almost had a Tony Soprano moment. END
BEGIN NOW   Why do you hipsters and no etiquette knowing men wear your stupid baseball hats indoors and in a dinner house? My wife kept one of you from a good stare-down and punch out from a former Marine having dinner on Memorial Day. END
BEGIN NOW  Restaurant Week Review!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  Bellanico has a phenomenal menu, and they have really chosen a tasting menu that shows off the diversity of the dishes they offer. END
BEGIN NOW   I *almost* came back for lunch today, but decided to try a different menu solely for the sake of variety. END
BEGIN NOW   The space is very warm and inviting; it reminded us of being in a small cafe in Europe. END
BEGIN NOW   The servers were really nice, and the owner spent time walking around and making sure everything was going o. END
BEGIN NOW  k. END
BEGIN NOW   without being too obtrusive; he obviously cares a lot about his customers' experience. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu started out with two small appetizers, both practically bite-size. END
BEGIN NOW   They were a nice start to the menu; they provided a small tasting and good flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Next followed the "primi" course; we chose "tombo tuna" and "braised lamb belly. END
BEGIN NOW  " While probably the weakest course on the menu, the proteins in each of these dishes were still really good. END
BEGIN NOW   We were not super happy with the chickpeas in the tuna dish or the red mustard in the lamb belly, but aside from those two items, both dishes were still strong. END
BEGIN NOW  The secondi dishes were very strong; we ordered the ono (turned out to be trout) and pork tenderloin. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork tenderloin was the star dish of the night; I would *HIGHLY* recommend ordering it. END
BEGIN NOW   The trout was also pretty good, although probably fishier than the ono would have been. END
BEGIN NOW  For desert, you will get a sampling of deserts (unless you are here for lunch, in case you will have to choose). END
BEGIN NOW   The espresso panna cotta and hazelnut cakes were both really, really good; I would have a tough time choosing between them. END
BEGIN NOW   The hazelnut cake came warm from the oven and with homemade ice cream: yum! The cheesecake had a very strong goat aftertaste. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, we were very happy with our decision to try this great little cafe for restaurant week!. END
BEGIN NOW  This was my first visit to this cute neighborhood gem. END
BEGIN NOW   I was quite impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Buzzy warm vibe on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW   Smaller restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating (enclosed patio with heaters). END
BEGIN NOW  The menu was impressive because it was very unique. END
BEGIN NOW   Not your typical Italian eatery. END
BEGIN NOW   A lot to explore. END
BEGIN NOW   They also offer the option of a fix prix menu or a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW   We opted for a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW  We began with the tuna crudo with watermelon radish and grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW   To accompany this appetizer we got the warm farro with hen of the woods mushrooms, cranberries, and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW   A fantastic pairing to share with the tuna crudo!. END
BEGIN NOW  Next, we shared the pasta with tomatoe sauce and hot peppers. END
BEGIN NOW   A super cool feature that they offer is the option to order dishes as appetizer or entree size! I love this because it gives you a lot of freedom. END
BEGIN NOW   You can order a bunch of dishes and share them rather than just having one entree. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun!. END
BEGIN NOW  Then there is the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW   Again, I was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Wines offered from many regions. END
BEGIN NOW   We explored some cool Italian whites and reds. END
BEGIN NOW   And once again, they allow you to order half or full glasses. END
BEGIN NOW   And they have a full menu of wine tasting flights. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun, fun, fun!. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun guy, originally from Mexico, who clearly loves what he does. END
BEGIN NOW   Passionate. END
BEGIN NOW   Attentive. END
BEGIN NOW   Knowledgeable. END
BEGIN NOW   And just fun to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW  We ended our meal with the most delicious goat cheese cheescake. END
BEGIN NOW   That was a first. END
BEGIN NOW  and boy was it amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   Covered with pistachio toffee crumbles and paired with strawberries. END
BEGIN NOW   I would go back just to order that again. END
BEGIN NOW  We will return. END
BEGIN NOW   Bravo. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally. END
BEGIN NOW    OMG finally. END
BEGIN NOW    An Italian restaurant I can finally love coming too. END
BEGIN NOW    It's been a long, hard battle to even find a decent meal in the Bay Area, and I found my gem in the most boring part of this area. END
BEGIN NOW    Who would have guessed. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything, from start to finish, was stellar. END
BEGIN NOW    Just complex enough to make you feel special, and simple enough where it felt casual. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfect!  The $40 fix price menu is a steal. END
BEGIN NOW    We did that with an additional app, and a main, and the portions were right on. END
BEGIN NOW    The chocolate pot de creme desert. END
BEGIN NOW  whoa. END
BEGIN NOW  it's like a lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW  on par with Angelines chocolate pot de creme and Chez Mama's choco lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW  I will be back here again, and again. END
BEGIN NOW    It's simply stellar Italian. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes it's not a hip part of town, yes there are all old people in here, if you drove by you'd think some local dump restaurant that people go to because it's convenient. END
BEGIN NOW    You'd be wrong. END
BEGIN NOW  Only miss:  I went to brunch before, and was not impressed. END
BEGIN NOW    At all. END
BEGIN NOW    I was skeptical when the gf said this is her fave place. END
BEGIN NOW    But after dinner, I took back my insults from the brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Three stars because this neighborhood needs one remaining place you can get a decent glass of wine in a cute setting. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is challenging. END
BEGIN NOW    Perhaps if you stick to apps and drinks you'll be alright, but the mains, in my experience, vary from over salted to mushy, to flavorless. END
BEGIN NOW   Good luck. END
BEGIN NOW  I have no idea how Bellanico received it's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I was deceived. END
BEGIN NOW  To summarize: great service, cute spot, feels over-crowded, food is not good and I will never come back. END
BEGIN NOW  What we ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW  Duck Pate - literally slabs of pate on toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Presentation was terrible and the pate taste off. END
BEGIN NOW  Pork belly- not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW   It came on a skewer of chewy pork belly and fingerling potatoes and I liked the potatoes more. END
BEGIN NOW  Ribeye - OK steak but nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW   Temperature was correct and came with bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW  Being the snazzy little Yelper I am, I snagged a 6 pm reservation on the last day of Restaurant Week (truth: Mr. END
BEGIN NOW   P knew exactly what would brighten my day and stumbled across an abandoned reservation on Open Table). END
BEGIN NOW   This area can be a little limited in parking, so give yourself some extra time. END
BEGIN NOW  Romantic lighting, enclosed patio seating, new silverware between each course. END
BEGIN NOW   this is a very nice date night with all the lovely details without being pretentious. END
BEGIN NOW   Very attentive and kind staff who put up with all my batty questions and gave me great suggestions. END
BEGIN NOW   (For whatever reason I have the hardest time figuring out what is on Italian menus unless it's crystal clear. END
BEGIN NOW   Agnolotti, tortelli, sformato. END
BEGIN NOW   err. END
BEGIN NOW  ). END
BEGIN NOW  I could slowly talk you through bite by bite, but I'm going to just get to the point. END
BEGIN NOW   The bacala was my absolute favorite, and I could probably eat the dark and white panna cotta every day for the rest of my life. END
BEGIN NOW   I think whatever you order here will be a delightful culinary experience. END
BEGIN NOW   Also it doesn't hurt coming here during restaurant week when you can indulge for just $30 per person. END
BEGIN NOW   Such a steal!. END
BEGIN NOW  What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant! Bellanico is a local gem that has stellar service to match their scrumptious menu. END
BEGIN NOW  We came here on a lazy Sunday with our two young kids. END
BEGIN NOW   They were offering their Oakland Restaurant week brunch menu for $24, to which you can add wine pairing for $10. END
BEGIN NOW  Here's what we tried:. END
BEGIN NOW  Burrata with roasted baby beets -- they make their own burrata, which works really well with the Grillo white paired with it. END
BEGIN NOW  Braised and seared pork belly -- loved the crispy skin and tender meat, specially with the "Merlau" red. END
BEGIN NOW  Poached eggs and prosciutto on country bread -- liked this version of Eggs Benedict, paired with a Bordeaux blanc. END
BEGIN NOW  Butternut squash and goat cheese frittata -- fluffy and creamy, yet quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW   Paired well with a Loire white blend. END
BEGIN NOW  Dark and white chocolate panna cotta -- rich and creamy. END
BEGIN NOW  Florentine doughnuts - our kids loved this with the sage custard sauce and chocolate dip. END
BEGIN NOW   Only problem was that there were only 5 small pieces for $8. END
BEGIN NOW  Goat cheese cheesecake with pistachio brittle -- my fave dessert, love the savory cheese with the crunchy brittle. END
BEGIN NOW  Our brunch also came with complimentary muffins. END
BEGIN NOW   My kids loved these and our server was gracious enough to provide us with another helping! Overall, we highly recommend Bellanico and look forward to coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking: It was a little tough and hard to find street parking. END
BEGIN NOW   Luckily on Sunday we found a few spots and parking was free. END
BEGIN NOW   With my handicapped brother it was also hard to find any parking near the hotel for easier access. END
BEGIN NOW   There were a few loading zone spots out front (handicapped can park there for as long as needed!) So if you have anyone that needs to be closer, that could work. END
BEGIN NOW  Wow! So glad I chose this place for my birthday brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   I was able to make reservations a week in advance for a party of 7. END
BEGIN NOW   We got an excellent view of the lake and I really enjoyed the glass windows and interiors. END
BEGIN NOW   They had live jazz music playing as well! Impressive! Their Irish coffee is strong! Be forewarned!!! I needed a nap after. END
BEGIN NOW   I enjoyed the food as well, splitting a classic mushroom omelette and biscuits and gravy with my boyfriend. END
BEGIN NOW   They were able to do a side pancake for me which was nice since that was unlisted on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   I also tried a bit of the Jack London omelette, which had delicious chunks of crab in it. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all its a great place to bring your family and they take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW   Good views, good food and good service. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect for special occasions or if you want a nice fancier atmosphere for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  We reserved a table for 4 people here on Saturday via opentable. END
BEGIN NOW   However, when we arrived it was clear they didn't want us there. END
BEGIN NOW   Even though we had a reservation, they didn't even ask our names. END
BEGIN NOW   Instead the hostess rudely quipped 'if you want to sit down you'll have to order within 2 minutes, we have an event today. END
BEGIN NOW  ' We tried to explain we had a reservation and by now a few team members had come over but only to give us a similarly rude message 'if your party isn't here very soon, they can't order'. END
BEGIN NOW   We quickly left. END
BEGIN NOW  This could all have been avoided by simply not accepting a reservation that you can't service, and when it happens - be nice about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Coming to celebrate a graduation, we came to The Terrace Room for brunch as a big group on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW   With the exception of the view, I'd say the place is pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW  Part I: The Untrained Waitress. END
BEGIN NOW  Although the waitress was nice, she had no clue about the menu, how to properly pour a champagne and the fact that water should be refilled for clients. END
BEGIN NOW   Not only did she overpour the champagne glass, but managed to hold the bottle as if she is pouring vodka after a day at a Russian sauna (holding it with a grasp at the neck). END
BEGIN NOW   Didn't leave the cork on the table either. END
BEGIN NOW   Anyways, she didn't even know that Mumm sparkling wine was on the menu and I had to point her directly to it. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean, it's a brunch restaurant, there are 3 sparkling wines on the menu, does one really need a curriculum to learn them? Unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW  Part II: The Standard Menu. END
BEGIN NOW  Moving on, the menu is pretty average and the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't anything to make me brag about this spot to a friend, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the Crab eggs Benedict and it was fine. END
BEGIN NOW   Another person at our table had the chorizo omelet and had similar impressions. END
BEGIN NOW  Part III: The Shining. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes, there is an area where they shine and I am confident they already know it. END
BEGIN NOW   The view from the table is killer, overlooking the lake, it just adds a relaxing feel to the whole establishment. END
BEGIN NOW   Good spot for family pictures. END
BEGIN NOW  Conclusion:. END
BEGIN NOW  Would I come back? Perhaps, if I ran out of other options to try, but it's an average restaurant with an above average view. END
BEGIN NOW   Had the waitress been better versed in the service industry, I would have given 4 stars for the view and food. END
BEGIN NOW  We were here last night again for the Y's yearly Annual Campaign Victory dinner and I was looking forward to the beautiful view, spending time with friends and having a wonderful meal. END
BEGIN NOW    I can say that I had all three but there were some rude glitches along the way. END
BEGIN NOW    Dinner wasn't served until around 6:45 or 7 so we had a chance to have something to drink at the bar and chat with our friends. END
BEGIN NOW  I used my yelp check-in and noticed that I could get $3 off any happy hour food or drinks so I showed the bartender my yelp check-in. END
BEGIN NOW    She indicated that if I was part of the Y event, that I could not use my happy hour check-in; however, I was paying for my alcoholic drink and it was not part of the banquet we were attending as other patrons were in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    That didn't seem fair to me. END
BEGIN NOW    However, I was able to get my discount for my drink. END
BEGIN NOW    Then later during the dinner, one of my friends at our table, asked for some ketchup and the waiter rudely indicated that ketchup was not part of the banquet menu, what????. END
BEGIN NOW  Then when the delicious dessert was being served, the waiter was asking us who wanted coffee, another friend asked for his cup to be filled but he only had his cup filled 1/4?  I asked the same waiter for some coffee and mine was full. END
BEGIN NOW    This is the same waiter who refused to give another friend at our table ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't know the wait staff was so rude. END
BEGIN NOW    I have never had a bad experience with the wait staff here at The Terrace Room. END
BEGIN NOW  Going here transports me back to a by-gone era. END
BEGIN NOW   It's so easy sitting in this place to imagine how it was in the 20s. END
BEGIN NOW   It's especially nice when the sun is out and you get that nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   They have live music a lot, which obviously aligns with that historical period. END
BEGIN NOW   All this adds up to a really unique, fun and relaxing ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW  They have pretty awesome drink specials when the do have happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW   If you ask me, they need to extend their happy hours a bit, as the place is never mobbed or anything. END
BEGIN NOW   It probably won't ever be a very trendy place as it IS inside a retirement home ;-) It's actually pretty neat on swing nights seeing the 20 somethings who are into swing cause it's cool again mix with the folks that dug it when it was cool originally. END
BEGIN NOW  Although this place shares a building with a senior living center, it doesn't smell like old people. END
BEGIN NOW   Lol! They have a lounge area before entering the restaurant part with a piano which was dope. END
BEGIN NOW   Esp since there was someone there playing. END
BEGIN NOW  The view of the lake is really what you're paying for here. END
BEGIN NOW   Our waitress, Brittany, was very professional and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   She was upbeat and prompt with anything we needed. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved how our champagne was never empty for too long. END
BEGIN NOW   $17 for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. END
BEGIN NOW   The + about this place is you can switch off between the two. END
BEGIN NOW   And they had a bloody mary bar for you to have fun with. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was a little disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW   The brunch menu was a bit limited and the quality of the food was below what it's worth. END
BEGIN NOW   However, they had a cute basket of mini muffins that were tasty and moist which was different from other brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all it was good to try this place out. END
BEGIN NOW   I wouldn't mind coming here again but it would be for the view. END
BEGIN NOW   While the food wasn't horrible, there's nothing exciting about it either. END
BEGIN NOW  - Overpriced food that wasn't prepared well and hardly met an "ok" standard. END
BEGIN NOW  - Bad service and waiting time. END
BEGIN NOW  - No parking. END
BEGIN NOW  - Possible food poising/horrible gas. END
BEGIN NOW  This was a second dinner option selection due to a nearby restaurant that was closed for a private party. END
BEGIN NOW   Unfortunately we made the wrong choice and ate here. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes it has an amazing view of Lake Merritt, but other than that this place doesn't have anything going to for them. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu is small, I ordered the soup of the day which was mushroom creme, it was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing special and was somewhat separated. END
BEGIN NOW   For an entree I ordered roasted chicken that came with some kind of rice and scallions ($25) with a side of there potatoes ($6). END
BEGIN NOW   When the dish came it looked awful to begin with and was swimming in a pool of oil. END
BEGIN NOW   The roasted chicken was a pale skin color all over and had a lot of gristle. END
BEGIN NOW   Not to mention is was two dark meat pieces (legs) the cheapest part of chicken meat. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes where whole but needed some sort of sauce that was absent. END
BEGIN NOW   The grains on the dish had a nice flavor but the greens and chicken were so overpowered by oil that it was difficult to enjoy any of this dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW  The servers were friendly but it was unclear who our actual server was and we seemed to be seen mostly by the host who was busy seating. END
BEGIN NOW   It was not until the end of our meal that anyone checked in about how the experience was or if we need refills on drinks or water. END
BEGIN NOW  Now, about an hour later our group has all ended up in the bathroom and. END
BEGIN NOW   How do I say this nicely. END
BEGIN NOW   But our stomachs are in a lot of pain and it's a good thing we like each other because there's some serious gas and bathroom time happening. END
BEGIN NOW  This is the place for a girl's brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   First of all the lighting is amazing so all those selfies you're pretending you're not planning on taking will look INCREDIBLE. END
BEGIN NOW   The brunch options are diverse and doesn't have to kill your budget. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is a bit hit or miss, though. END
BEGIN NOW   My first time here I got the breakfast bagel sandwich and it was utter bliss, and everyone in my group (we were a party of 9) were served speedily and everyone was happy. END
BEGIN NOW   The next time I came, almost every person had a problem with their order (the wrong sides were brought out, goat cheese was missing from a goat cheese omelet). END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back again because this is a lovely place on lovely Lake Merritt, and I'll update this review to see if that day was a fluke or if it's a consistent thing. END
BEGIN NOW  Regards, I'll be back because the service is great and the view is honestly worth it alone. END
BEGIN NOW  As I predicted in my initial review, we didn't rush back here. END
BEGIN NOW    We returned for dinner and music tonight w/ Nina and Larry. END
BEGIN NOW    We found parking a few blocks away and arrived in time for our 6:30 reservations. END
BEGIN NOW    It was still light out and we had a lovely view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW    One of the things that encouraged our return, beside the music, was knowing that Louis Le Gassic, formerly chef at Bay Wolf, had been appointed as their new Executive Chef. END
BEGIN NOW    We were excited to try the food. END
BEGIN NOW    The group, Juke Joint, started performing at 7:00 on the bandstand I had observed the last time we were there for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  We were brought menus and a plate of sliced bread w/ a ramekin of soft butter. END
BEGIN NOW    Nina, Larry and I all decided to have glasses of Malbec while Alan opted for a glass of Downtown Brown, which Larry shared. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered a cup of turnip and apple soup w/ a float of truffle oil on top. END
BEGIN NOW    Alan, Nina and I ordered rack of lamb, which came w/ white beans and garlic green beans and Larry ordered salmon. END
BEGIN NOW    Alan and I ordered a side of honey braised carrots. END
BEGIN NOW    The soup was smooth and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    The lamb was cooked medium rare and was topped w/ a tasty salsa verde, which was almost like chimichurri. END
BEGIN NOW    Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW    The carrots were good, as were the white and green beans. END
BEGIN NOW    The wine was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    For dessert Nina and I shared an Irish coffee crème brulée, which was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    Alan had a fresh fruit plate. END
BEGIN NOW    He and Larry had coffee. END
BEGIN NOW    Service was smooth and just attentive enough. END
BEGIN NOW  The music was marvelous. END
BEGIN NOW    Several couples got up to dance, which was fun to watch. END
BEGIN NOW    One in particular was sensational. END
BEGIN NOW    We really enjoyed it and would have stayed even longer than we did, but the band took a break and Larry was ready to go so we left. END
BEGIN NOW    According to the Terrace Room website they have live music Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and Sundays at 11:00 for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    They have quite an impressive lineup of folks scheduled to play and I can see us returning to hear more music w/ another enjoyable meal. END
BEGIN NOW  Super delicious! My friend lives across the street and neither one of us had been here. END
BEGIN NOW   I had just finished the Nike Women's Half in SF so I rightfully needed to consume all the calories. END
BEGIN NOW  We lucked out and scored a table immediately by the window. END
BEGIN NOW   Score. END
BEGIN NOW   I love a view. END
BEGIN NOW  I fueled up with a cup of coffee ($4 - minus a star because I cannot understand why a cup of coffee is $4) and a water. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend ordered two eyes, with wheat toast, and mini waffles. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the Jack London omelet (crab, arugula, hollandaise, and I had egg whites) with wheat toast, and home fries. END
BEGIN NOW   Mouth. END
BEGIN NOW   Watering. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the little fruit garnish and was close to licking the plate before Jack came to take it away. END
BEGIN NOW  Jack was my server. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice, hipster looking fellow who was attentive, funny, and prompt. END
BEGIN NOW  So four stars! I'll be back with for sure. END
BEGIN NOW  just won't be getting $4 coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  Terribly rude, we walked in with a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW   As soon as we walked in we were rudely asked to wait with no explanation, the hostess didnt even ask our name or if we had a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW  When we explained our reservation, she chirped back that we'd have two minutes to order. END
BEGIN NOW  Then the chef and another hostess came out to add to their rudeness and certainly NOT make us feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW   We turned around and walked out. END
BEGIN NOW   Never coming again. END
BEGIN NOW  So I don't normally write yelp reviews, but I had a uniquely awful experience at the Terrace Room last night (Wednesday 4/20). END
BEGIN NOW   I'll start from the beginning:. END
BEGIN NOW  I was walking around Lake Merritt around 6pm and heard some amazing live music coming from this gorgeous glass room across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   Naturally, I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW   I find myself in the Terrace Room, which is incredibly beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW   I decide to sit at the bar because I was not in the mood for a formal dinner. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty busy but the bartender got to me in record time and whipped up a mean Old Fashioned (the classic old fashioned way with a sugar cube and muddler) and convinced me to order the nachos. END
BEGIN NOW   If this review was about the nachos alone, they'd be getting 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I wish I'd had the foresight to snap a pic to post because they were a work of art. END
BEGIN NOW   The brisket was so tender and the cheese was definitely drool-inducing. END
BEGIN NOW   So let's just say I was in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW  Then, this tiny rude server starts complaining to her that she opened a bottle of wine for him that she shouldn't have. END
BEGIN NOW   (I really was not trying to pay attention but he was making a spectacle). END
BEGIN NOW   She immediately apologized, and gave him an unopened bottle and got back to making drinks for the large group of women at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Then, for whatever reason, he continued to harp on and on about the opened bottle of wine, which was very rude and unprofessional. END
BEGIN NOW   I was just trying to watch the bands on stage, but instead was so rudely distracted by this one-man show. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't know how the bartender kept her cool, I woulda lost it. END
BEGIN NOW   I also happened to make awkward eye contact with several other people sitting at the bar, sharing looks of discomfort/annoyance with the server's display, so I know I'm not just unusually observant. END
BEGIN NOW  Thought he was done but oh no he comes back barking his orders at her. END
BEGIN NOW   What really got me was that when she'd rush to make the drinks, they'd then sit there for at least TEN minutes getting diluted/warm/shitty. END
BEGIN NOW   Honestly, I felt really bad for that woman. END
BEGIN NOW   just another example of men feeling the need to verbally abuse and dominate a young and talented girl. END
BEGIN NOW   I made it known to her that I respected and admired her hard work, and she just smiled and shrugged, as if it was no big deal. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all I came to enjoy the music and food/drinks, but this tiny little man just kept ruining the ambience and experience. END
BEGIN NOW   It is beyond me how a manager and restaurant allows for such inappropriate behavior, let alone allow it to disrupt the experience of a patron. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks were great and the music wonderful, but it pains me too much to see that behavior, so I will not be coming back. END
BEGIN NOW  Bottomless bloody Mary's and/or mimosas, what could be better?. END
BEGIN NOW  Started off with a bloody Mary and told the waitress I would be switching to mimosas afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW   She forgot, no big so I had two bloody Mary's and then switched. END
BEGIN NOW  I was going to get the chicken and waffles, but the waitress informed me that it was two wings and not breast as I had hoped so instead got the two egg breakfast with bacon and sausage. END
BEGIN NOW   They didn't skimp on the meat which was awesome and the English muffin was nicely toasted. END
BEGIN NOW  They started us off with mini muffins and fresh jam that were a very nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW  We sat by the window which provides an amazing view of the lake, overall great experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Located in the same building in, or at least next door to, a senior living facility, the Terrace Room offers a gorgeous view of Lake Merritt from the west, which means that most of the time you won't be blinded by the sun like you would from the other side of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  The food offerings include all the usual dishes you'd expect of a mainstream Californian restaurant, with the dishes sticking more towards the familiar instead of the inventive. END
BEGIN NOW   Moreover, given the generally average quality of the dishes, the prices seem just a bit steep. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, the atmosphere here is rather quiet and sedate. END
BEGIN NOW   Adding to this is the fact that, lake view aside, the place feels like a country cottage. END
BEGIN NOW   Your best bet would probably be brunch, when you can enjoy a sunny view of the lake, and when other folks dining at the restaurant are also in sunny dispositions. END
BEGIN NOW  They have TRIVIA every other monday night at 7:30!!! It's really fun. END
BEGIN NOW   The hosts are cool, the food is good, the drinks are fun (but kind of expensive). END
BEGIN NOW   The parking is easy then because its late on a monday. END
BEGIN NOW   I parked right against the lake, literally in front of the building. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're looking for a place in Oakland to play trivia - you've found it. END
BEGIN NOW   The questions range from anything about pop culture, history, oakland themed, etc. END
BEGIN NOW   It's hard, but not too hard. END
BEGIN NOW   6 people to a team. END
BEGIN NOW   The prizes are gift certificates to the Terrace room. END
BEGIN NOW   I had a blast when I went with my friends. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll definitely be going back!. END
BEGIN NOW  Note: The entrace to the terrace room is through the hotel entrance. END
BEGIN NOW   ((I had trouble finding it the first time I went there)). END
BEGIN NOW  Ok, first of all, one of the bartenders are not very nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is slow, and I'm not sure if it was the colour of my skin, or just lack of skill, but I didn't feel very welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW   The girl, Molly was nice, and I appreciated her interaction. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, it literally took 40 minutes on a not so busy night to get a grilled cheese sandwich (which I had tipped before getting it). END
BEGIN NOW   I was so offended and turned off of my interaction, and the way the bar tender treated my fiend and I, I did not eat my food. END
BEGIN NOW  I also love how the bartender commented "you know no body cares" while I wrote this review, and yes this comment was directed at me. END
BEGIN NOW   HE WAS SO RUDE ! Won't recommend a place that doesn't care about their customers, just saying!. END
BEGIN NOW  very nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW   not the most crowded on a friday night but it was kind of nice not having to shove your way through everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW   seems like more of a started bar?. END
BEGIN NOW  someone said that they have amazing whiskey sours in their review. END
BEGIN NOW   i was excited but disappointed that they served their whiskey sours in the -not with egg white- fashion. END
BEGIN NOW   nevertheless, it was still well made. END
BEGIN NOW   but again, just thought the drinks were reasonably priced and jsut good. END
BEGIN NOW  Meet my favorite cocktail bar in Oakland! I last ended up here after being booted out of Fauna. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh, Fauna, when will you do something about your absurdly early last call times? We decided to head down the street and continue the festivities for my birthday. END
BEGIN NOW  After getting a nice happy birthday wish from the doorman, we headed inside to grab some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   The cocktails here were, as usual, amazingly tasty and reasonably priced ($9 - $12). END
BEGIN NOW   If memory serves me correct, I stuck with my favorites: Bee's Knees and Stones Throw. END
BEGIN NOW   Hooray for ginger beer! And, hooray for cool bartenders too!. END
BEGIN NOW  It was just after midnight on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW   Our group was able to secure a table, relax, and enjoy the rest of the night. END
BEGIN NOW  Tip: This place is conveniently located nearby the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW  Bonus Birthday Tip: There's a food stand about a block away with bacon-wrapped hot dogs! As if that wasn't enough, the woman running the stand is absolutely hilarious!. END
BEGIN NOW  Dogwood is a solid bar in a happening stretch of town, right near the Fox Theatre where Telegraph branches off Broadway towards the north. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a good variety of tasty cocktails to choose from, and the bartenders are knowledgeable and and friendly enough to make anything you want. END
BEGIN NOW   What's more, there's a decent menu of munchies, like the totally delicious cubanito sandwich I tried. END
BEGIN NOW   While the interior might feel a bit dark as you walk in, you'll adjust quickly to the cozy yet retro-sleek ambience. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, you have to give the owners credit for sticking it out here over the years. END
BEGIN NOW   Dogwood is located on such a busy street corner that drunk drivers have crashed into it twice, while rioters have also smashed the windows twice. END
BEGIN NOW   Nevertheless, the area is on the way up and  the owners have bounced back each time. END
BEGIN NOW   Judging by the healthy crowds this place gets, it looks like the community has embraced Dogwood as well. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here before a show at the Fox Theater to grab a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The bees knees was sweet and yummy. END
BEGIN NOW   It's dangerous because it really doesn't taste like alcohol at all. END
BEGIN NOW   The 2nd cocktail I had (and the name I completely forgot) was described by the bartender as an adult version of an orange julius, and she was spot on. END
BEGIN NOW   It was refreshing and the egg whites made it super rich and frothy. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried a sip of what the bf drank (stones throw and farmer's daughter) and they were all good!. END
BEGIN NOW  Of course, we had to try the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   And the reviews aren't kidding when they say it's BOMB DOT COM. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect to munch on with your drinks!! Buttery, cheesy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't busy when we went so we were able to find seats and service was quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW  $5 for a delicious, buttery, perfectly pressed grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   The option to add sundried tomato, basil, and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW   Little cornichons on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   Mustard (the good stuff, mind you, none of that French's yellow) provided without asking. END
BEGIN NOW   Dogwood literally served me my dream sandwich on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW   If that isn't culinary inception, I don't know what is. END
BEGIN NOW  As for cocktails, they are creative, tasty, and strong. END
BEGIN NOW   I love the Brooklyn, and the Bees Knees is, well, the BEES KNEES. END
BEGIN NOW   It's true you may have to wait - Dogwood can be packed late at night, and usually have just one bartender during happy hours/early evening. END
BEGIN NOW   I hate waiting, but if I had to wait, there's nowhere I'd rather hang around than a converted apothecary/pharmacy where the smell of grilled cheese permeates every corner. END
BEGIN NOW  I think the bar is ok. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here many times so obviously it is good enough to come back to. END
BEGIN NOW    The reason for the two stars is that I've just experienced way better. END
BEGIN NOW    When I think about Dogwood, I think about a place that is just like any 'ol Mission hipster bar in the City but trying to not be that way because it is very "Oakland and proud" but, nonetheless, is just like a Mission hipster bar in the city. END
BEGIN NOW    The well drinks are watered down but the cocktails are good (and overpriced, just like any Mission hipster bar). END
BEGIN NOW   Except therein lies the problem, this is Oakland, not the City, so the bar would be better just being Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  I have found the bartenders to range from being very friendly to ratchet. END
BEGIN NOW   who would have thought?  Also, any bartender that doesn't know what is in a Cape Cod should not be working as a bartender (IMHO). END
BEGIN NOW  I'm a fan of the grilled cheese and cheese/meat plates which I do like and appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm sure I'll be back to this bar at some point but this isn't really a place I care to go to on the regular. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is ok if you don't mind paying those "new Oakland" prices and rub shoulders with the sf crowd, ooops, I mean new Oakland crowd that has taken over Downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Service used to be pretty good but is now pretty bad, don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. END
BEGIN NOW  Drinks were decent, a little slow on service. END
BEGIN NOW    A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW  Would have given a better review if they had not doubled the tip i originally gave them. END
BEGIN NOW    Be careful with using your credit card here. END
BEGIN NOW  Had a nice, low-key evening at Dogwood on a Monday night!. END
BEGIN NOW  I came out to Oakland from SF to meet a friend, and loved that this place was a block away from the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and basil, and it was absolutely delicious!  I also enjoyed my ginger beer cocktail, as well as a glass of wine. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was very friendly, though we did have to go up to the bar to place our orders. END
BEGIN NOW  The place wasn't too loud or busy on a Monday night, which made it a great atmosphere for catching up with an old friend. END
BEGIN NOW  The prices are reasonable too!. END
BEGIN NOW  I have visited this place many times, but I can't find myself to give a review. END
BEGIN NOW   I feel the place is too pretentious, pricy, and unfriendly bartender. END
BEGIN NOW   The only redeeming quality of the place is the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   Not to mention very cramp. END
BEGIN NOW  I have since changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW   I like the expansion and the food window. END
BEGIN NOW   More room, feel more friendly, and It feel more accepting. END
BEGIN NOW   Though, I was a bit tipsy because it was birthday. END
BEGIN NOW   I may have to check back again to give another try. END
BEGIN NOW  What I had: the bees knees, various grilled cheese sandwiches, pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW  Visit date: January 13, 2015. END
BEGIN NOW  First time? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW  Twas a fun evening at Dogwood. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the bees knees - it was a decent drink, sweet and sour. END
BEGIN NOW   What really stood out were the snacks! We had two kinds of grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   One had tomato jam and the other had tomato and basil. END
BEGIN NOW   Both were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread had a crisp outside and soft inside. END
BEGIN NOW   The cheese was gooey and warm. END
BEGIN NOW   I have a special place in my tummy for tomato jam and Dogwood's was an A+. END
BEGIN NOW   The dijon dipping sauce added a nice touch, too. END
BEGIN NOW   So did the pickles. END
BEGIN NOW  There are plenty of seats around and open space to stand around or dance. END
BEGIN NOW   Order your food at the bar and they'll bring it out to you. END
BEGIN NOW  Another venue that endearingly screams "Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  " This a long, narrow joint that somehow manages to pack in lots of people at the bar and in seated areas along the wall, all while featuring a dance stage in the back. END
BEGIN NOW   The setting feels old-school, almost Art Deco-ish. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd is casual, friendly, and unpretentious, as is to be expected of Oakland, and there's a large menu of yummy cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Despite the fact that it can get busy on weekends, waits at the bar are never too long, and you can fit yourself in, whether with groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW  've been to Three Fifty-Five twice in the last few years, and I enjoyed both visits. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar is a narrow space off of 19th Street. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a proper bar, followed by some tables and a dance floor in back. END
BEGIN NOW  The drink menu is good - and cheap! My wife and I both enjoyed two cocktails each on our most recent visit, and the price tag was around $8 or $9. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was friendly and efficient, which is welcome given that crowds start streaming in after nine. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd be back if I were looking for a more intimate bar in downtown Oakland (until it gets a little rowdier in the later hours). END
BEGIN NOW  You know, considering how Bar Three Fifty Five wasn't even our intended destination, I'd say our experience here was a pleasant surprise. END
BEGIN NOW    Not that I ever thought the place would be bad. END
BEGIN NOW    Not when, moments after checking in on Yelp, fellow Yelper Vi T. END
BEGIN NOW   commented, "good choice". END
BEGIN NOW    Talk about a stamp of approval!. END
BEGIN NOW  People have described the place as a nicer type of dive, and I guess I can kind of see that. END
BEGIN NOW    However, I'd say it's more like an old school bar (think Tosca Cafe in SF), what with its aged charm and decor (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW    There's still a bit of an Oakland vibe in the air though, and the small stage in back makes them pretty different in comparison, but that bar!  Love the look of it, as well as their slate of alcohol that fills their shelves and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The cocktail menu is short and sweet (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  com/biz_photos/bar-…), and not very expensive at $8 a pop (no wonder they're so beloved!). END
BEGIN NOW    Everything sounded great, but, on my friend's recommendation, I opted for the STARDUST REMEDY (Pimm's, Calvados, Ginger, Lime, and Falernum). END
BEGIN NOW    The name may sound child friendly, but this cocktail is definitely mature. END
BEGIN NOW    Balanced flavors with a decent pour, refreshing with some bite, and well-crafted by a bartender/mixologist that knows her stuff (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW  Since we arrived relatively early, snagging a table for the six of us was relatively easy, as was parking around the corner. END
BEGIN NOW    However, don't be surprised if the place gets packed to the gills as the night goes on. END
BEGIN NOW    As we were leaving, a steady stream of folks were filing in (it's just two blocks over from The Fox Theater). END
BEGIN NOW    Either way, Bar Three Fifty Five is worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW  and one of my new favorite bars in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW  Great cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Dark and intimate venue. END
BEGIN NOW  good for a date spot if you're into it. END
BEGIN NOW   The crowd is hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW   Younger professional crowd around happy hour, older 30s to 40s crowd later in the night. END
BEGIN NOW  OMGGGGG the red hair bartender is the rudest person ever I have never been treated like THATTT!!!!!!!she was the RUDEST person ever!!!!!! I just asked for a tequila drink and just repplied with if u want I can make u a paloma as only option efortless cuz was 1 am. END
BEGIN NOW   I agreed she came with a poorly made "paloma" my peers tryed and said tasfted rotted as I thpughtttttt cuz was goss. END
BEGIN NOW   Gave it back telling her something was wrong I wanted a last word and OMG she started saying bad words and throw it in my face complaining. END
BEGIN NOW   Came back with a poorly made, of course. END
BEGIN NOW   "Last word" OMG WiTH ICE IN THE DRINKKKKKKKKK when this drink was served UP!!#!#!!!!! I work in the industry and I WOULDVE FIRED HER ASS IN THE SPOT. END
BEGIN NOW   Im a current customer and your are going to see my face often and return drinks if they are bad. END
BEGIN NOW   I dont know how you can call youself bartender. END
BEGIN NOW   Its not about knowledge or skills (missing on you, higly noticeable) you also need peolpe skills. END
BEGIN NOW  My food was burned and waaaaaay too over priced for what it is, sorry I hate to leave bad comments, but this is the third time in a row I have terrible. END
BEGIN NOW  food. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm very surprised that I have not written a review for 355. END
BEGIN NOW   I was here last night and it had been, possibly, a year and a half since I was last here. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a written a review of this, I probably would have given this place three stars. END
BEGIN NOW  The reason being, I never really cared too much for this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Every time I would come here in the past, it was because other people wanted to go here. END
BEGIN NOW   I just always thought they were trying WAY too hard with their cocktails and never wanted to come in here on my own accord. END
BEGIN NOW  Yesterday, the lovely Lorrayne suggested meeting here for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   I was for it and since it had been so long since I was last here, I decided to give it another chance. END
BEGIN NOW   To my surprise, the menu changed. END
BEGIN NOW   It actually made sense and didn't give me a headache trying to look through it. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried their 19th Street Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good. END
BEGIN NOW   After that, I had to try their Gin & Housemade Tonic. END
BEGIN NOW   I love gin and I love gin & tonics. END
BEGIN NOW   Theirs was so good, I had three of them. END
BEGIN NOW   Lorrayne ordered a Dark & Stormy, which is also another one of my favorite drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   She let me have a taste. END
BEGIN NOW   It was very delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   It seems like they top theirs off with egg white and Lorrayne also informed me that they also make their ginger beer in house. END
BEGIN NOW  So I must give thanks to Lorrayne for actually making me interested in Bar 355. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back here, even if it's on my own. END
BEGIN NOW  There are definitely hipsters here but not the annoying ones that think listening to their grandparents songs on a gramophone is cool. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is the definition of great vibes! I love this place!. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing brings out a diverse and social crowd. END
BEGIN NOW   The music is low but still vibrant, which creates a great setting to mingle without screaming. END
BEGIN NOW   Feel free to get into an intense and fun game of bocce ball! Even standing around and watching is entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW   My friends and I meet and network with many amazing people all the time! Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. END
BEGIN NOW  Our go to drink is the FRENCH MUSE, a must have! It looks all cute and innocent, but it is slightly dangerous! 1 will have you in a chillin' mood, 2 tipsyyy, and 3 LIT!! You will feel like you have been drinking all night, which is pretty much drink goals! My limit is usually 3, I don't dare go past! I always have a great time here! Each element of Make Westing creates the perfect ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW  This is definitely the spot to go for after work drinks, pre-games, or weekend hangouts! One of my favorite places in Oakland by far!. END
BEGIN NOW  Hipster bar alert. END
BEGIN NOW  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW   For the most part, it has a comfortable, inviting environment. END
BEGIN NOW   The indoor bocce ball courts are a nice touch, but be prepared to wait a while until one opens up. END
BEGIN NOW   By the same token, don't take too long when you get a court!. END
BEGIN NOW  I took off a star because an employee was super rude to me for no particular reason. END
BEGIN NOW   He was clearing glasses from the bocce court area and was walking back toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I was inadvertently blocking his pathway, but instead of asking me politely to step to the side, he said in a sarcastic, annoyed tone, "It would help if you moved. END
BEGIN NOW  " Typically, that's not how you would want to treat your customers, but hey, they didn't ask me. END
BEGIN NOW  Been here a few times for drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool hipster place in downtown Oakland, slow on Mondays and usually very busy Thursday-Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW  They make really good gimlets and mojitos. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartenders are friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   They have appetizers as well but I cannot rate them on that since I just go there for drinks, however the habanero popcorn looked really yummy the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW  Very chill place to mingle with the locals in the area, definitely a place you can wear tennis shoes or heels. END
BEGIN NOW   Recommend this place to anyone looking to go to watch the games or hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Braised oxtail sando!!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  I was able to sample there Braised oxtail sandwich and let me say I will be back for more, not oily, not fatty, near perfection on a toasted bun. END
BEGIN NOW   The sandwich on a whole was a tad small, especially if you are sharing, but the meat was tender and flavorful, not to salty, more or less all around perfect on meat to bun proportion. END
BEGIN NOW  I also sampled the bone marrow dish, no skimming on this dish, full heavy amount of bone marrow on the bone, like most places that offer this dish you are scraping the bone to get every last bit, here the marrow was heavy, oily, thick consistency, throw it on some toasted bread that is offered and it is delicious, you can dip the bread in the sauce found underneath the bone, ohh man sooo good,. END
BEGIN NOW  I do recommend this place for the food, I did sample few beers, I would stay for there food that they offer. END
BEGIN NOW  food **** oxtail sandwich is a plus, bone marrow also a plus. END
BEGIN NOW  service **** no wait, walked up to the bar and ordered, received the food in 5 min. END
BEGIN NOW  price $$. END
BEGIN NOW  ambiance **** large venue, bochi ball not regulated size but folks compete here, allot of room to stretch your legs, better to go on a week night to avoid several crowds during the friday and saturday crowds. END
BEGIN NOW  I will be back for more oxtail and bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW  Love Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW   Located in what is now Uptown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   Make Westing is serving up quality hand crafted cocktails from some of the most friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW   What I enjoy most at Make Westing is the cheese selection. END
BEGIN NOW   Cow , Sheep or goat. END
BEGIN NOW   I always go for the cow and each time I fall in love. END
BEGIN NOW   Make Westing is serving Brie at its peak temp and they got it right. END
BEGIN NOW  Outdoor seating with views of the hustle and bustle of the city. END
BEGIN NOW   Old school tavern feel inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Indoor Bocce. END
BEGIN NOW   clean restrooms and comfortable seating. END
BEGIN NOW   Make Westing is definitely key for Oakland Nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had each of their house cocoktails and they are amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I've visited this bar twice and both times I felt extremely uncomfortable and out of place. END
BEGIN NOW  After finding a seat at the bar, I was ignored by all three bartenders for atleast 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   Eventually, I enthusiastically waved one of the bartenders down to get his attention. END
BEGIN NOW   When he finally acknowledged me, he seemed annoyed or bothered that I wanted to BUY a drink. END
BEGIN NOW  This bar seems to cater to a very specific crowd, which baffles me in the ever so diverse Bay Area of CA. END
BEGIN NOW  I never understand how customer service can be so bad and/or exclusive especially when they don't realize that they are offending patrons that are spending their money in these establishments. END
BEGIN NOW  I likely will never return to this place as long as it is the Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW  Interesting!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place has a special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW   It is where I first met my husband and where he later proposed. END
BEGIN NOW  I still haven't been able to persuade anyone to play bocce ball with me. END
BEGIN NOW   :(. END
BEGIN NOW  Here are the perks. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're usually a designated driver this place is still a lot of fun. END
BEGIN NOW   There is bocce and spicy popcorn to be had. END
BEGIN NOW    There are friendly bartenders who don't stank face you for not consuming alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW   They are bright enough to realize they can sell or give you something non alcoholic and that they can sell even more drinks to your pals who are imbibing. END
BEGIN NOW    They know the score!!! :). END
BEGIN NOW  After the office Christmas party I and a small handful of my coworkers still wanted to be out and about, so we made our way from The Lake Chalet over to Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW   We somehow managed to grab a table with seats for all five of us in the incredibly packed place, and after perusing the menu of house cocktails I decided on a Garden Gimlet (gin, cucumber, basil, and lime). END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a big drinker and have always had a hard time finding cocktails I like, but the Garden Gimlet was really refreshing and light. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW  The bocce court was in full swing, the music was really good, and everyone seemed in good spirits. END
BEGIN NOW   It was loud but we could still have a conversation, and in general the atmosphere was really positive. END
BEGIN NOW   This is a cool place whether you're coming as a group or a couple, and I'd definitely like to come here again. END
BEGIN NOW  This is one of the least approachable bars on Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW   I've eaten the food here, and ended up bloody from bones which were not removed from the meat. END
BEGIN NOW   I've also enjoyed myself here many times after work in previous years when it was comfortable, it's when they bring in the bouncers on weekend nights that you are asking to be treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW   I would AVOID this bar until they hire more appropriate staff. END
BEGIN NOW   I would always love to support local business, but this place is not safe. END
BEGIN NOW  You'll notice the reviews are dropping on this place because its going down hill fast. END
BEGIN NOW   I would give it zero stars if I could after my recent visit. END
BEGIN NOW  You never know who you'll see at this bar!. END
BEGIN NOW  A group of friends met up here before the Allen Stone concert at The Fox Theatre, and low and behold, the man himself is hanging out at the bar with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Super cool. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a typical laid back, casual, hipster bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Good prices, lots of space, and and nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd come back here before a show next time, too!. END
BEGIN NOW  The last three times I've been in Radio bar they've had this human body mutilation video on which is kind of disturbing, but you can ignore it by keeping your gaze ahead toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   What you can't ignore is the crazy loud music when it's cranked. END
BEGIN NOW   The latter is the only thing about this bar that I don't like, probably because I prefer to be able to hear what people are saying without having to scream WHAT? repeatedly only to give up and nod politely. END
BEGIN NOW  Drinks are cheap and the bar is dark. END
BEGIN NOW   Stools are comfortable, and occasionally there are patrons inside who compliment your teeth!. END
BEGIN NOW  perhaps other than the fact that it seems to attract a lot of. END
BEGIN NOW  If you don't like Radio then you are likely:. END
BEGIN NOW  a) a pretentious prick from the 'burbs or SF. END
BEGIN NOW  b) a hipster douche canoe who got lost on their way to Make Westing (much respect for MW bartenders, their evening crowd just sucks). END
BEGIN NOW  c) a whiny waste of space on this planet. END
BEGIN NOW  d) not friends with me, thank god. END
BEGIN NOW  Zhiva, Melissa, Marni and the rest of the Radio crew are some of the nicest, most real people you will meet in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW   If they don't like you, you are probably a jerk with attitude and they are hoping you leave so the rest of us don't have to deal with your dumb-shit vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  That said, drinks are always strong and always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Music is constantly changing so don't complain if you don't like it. END
BEGIN NOW   If you don't like dark red-lit places, you should move along. END
BEGIN NOW  If you can let your hair down with a bunch of nice people and don't want to get ripped off while you drink, this is your bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Cool Divey spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Very chill vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure where they got the Asian decor inspiration from, but the red lights do set a decent tone. END
BEGIN NOW   Bartenders were nice, service was good. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely one of the nastiest bathrooms I've seen in my Day! Hah Kudos for that! Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW  Meh. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a cool place to hang out, have drinks and listen to the DJ spin, but the bathrooms are hideous and the place is kind of small. END
BEGIN NOW   Dancing is out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks are good and the people seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW   It's just ok in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW  Although I was the only person of Asian descent in the crowd here when I showed up, Radio appears to pay homage to its location near Chinatown by offering an intimate atmosphere that's not only lit dimly by lights in large red paper lanterns, but also punctuated by screens playing kung fu movies. END
BEGIN NOW  The atmosphere seems to be both loungey and dive bar-ish at the same time, while the overall vibe is friendly, approachable, and intimate. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll make a point of coming back and trying out some more of their drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  My friends and I were checking around Oakland for a good nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW   Being as its not the city we stumbled across Radio. END
BEGIN NOW   We went on a Friday night and the moment we got in we fell in love with the vibe and music. END
BEGIN NOW   Even though its small (since its a dive bar)  they have a good selection of alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're looking for drinks accompanied with good hip hop and the bay area hyphy vibe this is the place to go. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is tiny and cute- a little tight with the crowd it brings in but the atmosphere is loud and exciting. END
BEGIN NOW   The music bumps loudly and the bartenders are lively. END
BEGIN NOW   I was here via route bar hopping on Halloween night. END
BEGIN NOW   I really enjoyed the extra lighting and accent of the lanterns on the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW  The walls are lined with mirrors (which is a great idea for a small place), the bar expands most of the room, there is no dance floor but of course, no dance floor is no excuse not to shake your hips. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're lucky, you can find tables and seats in the back corner. END
BEGIN NOW  This is someplace I would def come back to check out on a night that isn't Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun!!. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a dark and divey bar with a pretty laid-back vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   It's narrow and sort of hard to move around much. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartender was cool and suggested a great cocktail for me when she found she didn't have all the ingredients for a Corpse Reviver #2. END
BEGIN NOW   My biggest complaint was the ladies room. END
BEGIN NOW   It was very tiny, not very clean, and the toilet was clogged. END
BEGIN NOW   I hope I would find it in better condition on my next visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Damn so I really loved this bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I was going a couple times a week (more like every day around 4 after work). END
BEGIN NOW   Will not be returning unfortunately. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been there at times and had an awesome experience with different bar tenders. END
BEGIN NOW    The long haired dude who drives a sick bike! Amazing and sooper nice. END
BEGIN NOW    This past 3 or 4 times I have always gotten service from a little ass hole of a chick. END
BEGIN NOW    First she's a jerk, 2nd,never smiles, and third she just has an unkind persona. END
BEGIN NOW    Like she doesn't want you there. END
BEGIN NOW  I go back at different times in hopes that she is NOT there but she is. END
BEGIN NOW  On several occasions she has not only been rude to me but my girlfriend as well. END
BEGIN NOW    Instances of refusing water because she's closing her register, or telling me to ask some one else in the most Dickish way. END
BEGIN NOW  Damn lady thanks to YOU you lost a loyal customer. END
BEGIN NOW    MAKE THAT TWO. END
BEGIN NOW  I used to always catch a last drink here before hopping on BART, so of them many times, a one drink stint is all I've really lingered for. END
BEGIN NOW    And to tell ya the troof, that is all I can really muster in here. END
BEGIN NOW  First, the place is thin and narrow, but long. END
BEGIN NOW    If you aren't lucky enough to get a seat at the bar (which is probable), then you have to plaster your back against the long wall. END
BEGIN NOW    And the space between the back of the stools and your face, is literally about 3 feet. END
BEGIN NOW    And in that 3 foot space is where the rest of the schleps will have to walk, back and forth in order to get to the rest rooms. END
BEGIN NOW  And to add to the insult, if it is a warm night, say 70's-80's, it will be 10-20 degrees warmer inside because I'm not sure if they have AC. END
BEGIN NOW    When the place fills up, all that body heat just compounds the problem. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't know how the bartenders are able to work in that heat. END
BEGIN NOW    Like clothes sticking to your skin. END
BEGIN NOW  heat. END
BEGIN NOW    Like, let's get outa here after this drink. END
BEGIN NOW  heat. END
BEGIN NOW  But outside of a few major logistical issues, this place is a dive in true form. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent cheap drinks, great music (must be from a shuffler cuz I didn't notice a juke) usually throwbacks of some sort. END
BEGIN NOW    Diverse crowd and quintessential dive bar lighting (red district red). END
BEGIN NOW    A drink here will evoke memories of intimate meetings of elaborate schemes of a devious nature. END
BEGIN NOW    But that's just me watching way too many Tarantino flicks. END
BEGIN NOW    Now if it can bring me there, then it can't be all bad, now can it?. END
BEGIN NOW  *throws in extra star*. END
BEGIN NOW  I want start this off by complimenting the bar itself I have always liked the environment and have felt invited to come in , I live in the area so I'm around the bar often. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm writing this review based on how I was treated twice upon trying to enter the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm 22 with a baby face so u get carded (no problem with that) , I don't like how I was treated by one of the female staff who was completely rude and disrespectful to me because I don't look my age after I gave multiple forms of ID ,credit cards I  even showed a medical record and birth certificate  I should have never have had to go that far. END
BEGIN NOW   After being turned away by the woman my second time trying to enter the bar the same woman told me that she would only serve me if the bar next door would serve me , so I literally went there and I was served without hesitation after being carded she walked into the bar and asked the bartender if he was going to serve me he replied yes. END
BEGIN NOW   Then she se said to me ok well I'm still not serving you ,your not worth it your not worth me losing my job at the bar so drink here. END
BEGIN NOW   I told her that I didn't want to go there and asked her why she was treating me that way and she replied because u look too young I don't care what your I'd says. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I had the name of the woman who was rude but unfortunately  I don't I feel the way she handled everything was wrong especially to turn a customer away to somewhere else just to come inside of that place where you do not work just  to turn them away is unprofessional and tacky. END
BEGIN NOW  OTHER THAN THIS INCIDENT ID SAY FIVE STAR TO THE BAR AND IT'S CREATED  ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW  Coolish dive bar, but ultimately just a dive bar with some very red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW    I look at the entrace to this bar every day, since I can see it from my work, but this was my first venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartender was interesting and chatty, and the beer selection was OK. END
BEGIN NOW    The very red lighting I didn't care much for, but I guess that's its shtick. END
BEGIN NOW   Ultimtely though, to me, it's just another bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm not sure it'd be my first choice for after work - I might go to the Tribune instead which has a better beer selection, and food. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars for the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   They are strong and CHEAP. END
BEGIN NOW   $4 for a gin and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW   That's cheaper than a beer at most places!. END
BEGIN NOW  I went on a Friday night and the music was an interesting mix of early 2000's R&B  and some stuffs that I had never heard before. END
BEGIN NOW   It was sort of hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW   It would start off with Shaggy "Wasn't Me" then would abruptly change to some tribal beat type deal. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe I'm ignorant to good music or not cultured. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe cultured people enjoy the music more. END
BEGIN NOW   All I know is I'm most happy when old school Nelly is playing uninterrupted for the entire night but maybe that's just me. END
BEGIN NOW  Plea to the manager: PLEASE stop letting people in when the place is saturated. END
BEGIN NOW   The bar is tiny. END
BEGIN NOW   By 11 pm it was nearly impossible to move yet I noticed the bouncer letting more and more people in. END
BEGIN NOW   We ended up leaving because it was so crowded and hot and not worth it :/. END
BEGIN NOW  Still, I give the place the 4 stars because I like the laidback vibe, the cheap drinks, and the hip hop/R&B jams. END
BEGIN NOW  A hipsterish establishment that's super, super dark. END
BEGIN NOW   So dark, in fact, that you'd half expect to see the Milky Way galaxy hovering overhead as if you were on a middle school stargazing trek somewhere super remote. END
BEGIN NOW  But instead of worrying about zombies popping out of the forest like you did on those dark stargazing treks, you'll have to deal with, well, hipsters and other more borderline types, who for all you know could indeed be walking zombies after a drink or a joint or two. END
BEGIN NOW   The dim red lighting doesn't accentuate people's best features, and you never know if people are staring at you just because they're also having a hard time seeing, or if they really really are creepy. END
BEGIN NOW  I appreciate that there are divey places like this in Oakland, but I also appreciate that there are many other places in Oakland to choose from that are more happening and more my style. END
BEGIN NOW  I dig it here. END
BEGIN NOW   Cheap happy hour from 4-9pm, they have Manhattan (my kinda drink), Martini, Lemon drop and Margarita all for $5. END
BEGIN NOW   It's really dark when you first walk in but your eyes will adjust eventually and all you see is the red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW   There are pool tables all the way in the back but it's also where the smokers are which I'm not a fan of cigarette smoke so I stay away from there. END
BEGIN NOW   DJ plays music after 10 or something like that and there's a small dancefloor so it gets packed around that time. END
BEGIN NOW   Bartenders and security were pretty friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't like that the bathroom only has one stall and can get pretty nasty but hey, it's to be expected at any bars right! It's a good spot to go to after work to decompress or meet up with friends for a good night and parking is always easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW  Hey, Bartender chick socializing with her friends with her back to me. END
BEGIN NOW   (For over 10 mins). END
BEGIN NOW  You suck and you're not as cool as you think. END
BEGIN NOW   You saw us and went about hooking your friends up with free drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   You should be fired. END
BEGIN NOW  As for the bar, loved the dingy vibe with the added hip hop. END
BEGIN NOW   Usually, dives like this play metal which is what I'm used to. END
BEGIN NOW  Too bad they didn't know who I was. END
BEGIN NOW  We didn't make it into the annual Autumn Lights Festival and were waiting in line in the cold with 1,000+ people. END
BEGIN NOW   We left and took a stroll on Lake Merrit and decided to continue the night in a better fashion. END
BEGIN NOW   We weren't sure what to expect and I didn't brush up on my Yelp reviews of this place, however, didn't think it was too bad of an idea. END
BEGIN NOW  We walked in and the place is completely dark. END
BEGIN NOW   You can literally piss or barf in the corner somewhere of at the bar, and no one would even notice it. END
BEGIN NOW   The light bulbs were all red tinted, which made the whole place blood red. END
BEGIN NOW   It's def. END
BEGIN NOW   appropriate for it's name. END
BEGIN NOW  and for Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW  There was no music that night, unfortunately, because drinking and dancing is always a great pair. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks were cheap, the bartender was friendly, and clientele was "freakish". END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe it was just the lighting. END
BEGIN NOW   The place is small in size, not sure where the dance floor would have taken place if there was a DJ playing that night. END
BEGIN NOW  We grabbed drinks and headed to a closed off back side where pool and chain smoking took place. END
BEGIN NOW   The crowd was decent, mostly groups of friends hanging out. END
BEGIN NOW   However, the tables were mostly covered in grossness and the seats weren't too clean either, but it's a dive bar- that's how they get the label right?. END
BEGIN NOW  I can see this place as a good stop on a night of bar hopping, maybe to pre-game and have smokes indoors, but definitely not a place to just hang out at all night. END
BEGIN NOW  Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW   Requested fun  dance music for the ladies completely crowded AROUND the deserted dance floor. END
BEGIN NOW   The DJ  took a full 15 MIN to transition to dance party tunes that filled the dance floor for half an hour. END
BEGIN NOW    Everyone was so happy! Then the dirge of indulgent "ni**a ni**a blessed pu*sy" - you can't make this up, music that cleared the floor. END
BEGIN NOW   When asked WTF I was told there was a 'formula' to get people to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Horrible club. END
BEGIN NOW   Terrible drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   If you want to dance, look elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW   The DJ is faaaaaaaar too into himself to keep the peeps happy to dance :(. END
BEGIN NOW  Creepers creeping in a way too smokey room, and I'm a smoker. END
BEGIN NOW   Good music and good drinks though. END
BEGIN NOW  Great "dive bar"! Wouldn't have known about this place if I wasn't brought here. END
BEGIN NOW   No sign on the outside so you wouldn't think to come in. END
BEGIN NOW    So dark inside. END
BEGIN NOW   There is a smoking lounge (did we go back in time??) But you can stay clear of that and just hang by the bar and the front area, no detection of any smoke so no problem! Drinks are affordable. END
BEGIN NOW   Music is a throwback, but overall a good place to start/end the night!. END
BEGIN NOW   Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW    Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW    Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW    Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW    And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW    But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW    And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW    I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW    After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW    Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW    I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW   There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW    With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW    I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW    Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW   If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW    The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW   As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW    Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW    Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW   On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW    I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW    They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW    :(. END
BEGIN NOW   I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW    We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW    Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW    The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW     There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW    The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW    The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW    But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW   Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW   JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW    He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW   The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW    from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW    Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW   Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW    No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW    Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW     The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW   What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW    Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW    The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW    We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW    If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW    Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW     Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW    I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW    I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW    I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW    The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW    You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW   I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW    Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW   Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW    They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW    The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW    Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW    Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW   This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW    BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW    I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW    His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW    I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW    Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW    Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW    I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW    I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW    Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW    I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW   It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW     Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW    Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW   Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW   I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW     Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW    The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW    Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW    Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW   So. END
BEGIN NOW    much. END
BEGIN NOW    whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW    They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW    They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW   It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW    Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW    It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW    What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW    More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW    The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW    I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW    Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW   This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW     Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW     Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW   00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW   This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW   Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW   And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW   Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW   Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW   The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW   Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW   Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW   Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW   This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW    It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW    The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW    Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW   a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW    space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW    you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW   on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW   Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW    Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW    For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW    But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW    And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW    Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW    The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW    Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW    The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW    I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW    Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW    I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW    Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW    Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW    Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW    They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW    Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW    Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW   The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW    Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW    I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW    I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW    There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW    I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW    I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW    Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW     The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW   The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW   I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW     Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW   Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW   Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW     If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW     This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW     You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW   Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW   PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW     Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW   Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW   I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW   Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW    My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW   Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW   My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW     We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW   The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW     That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW     Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW   However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW     Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW    i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW   "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW     So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW   But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW     Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW   One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW     She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW     Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW     Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW   To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW     There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW     But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW    They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW    However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW   To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW     And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW     Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW   They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW    In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW    Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW    Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW   This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW    Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW    The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW    You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW    If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW    The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW    The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW    Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW    He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW    We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW    He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW    "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW    I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW    The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW    All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW    Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW    Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW   At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW    What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW    Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW    Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW    What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW   Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW     And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW   I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW   My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW   " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW      Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW     My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW     "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW   ". END
BEGIN NOW   Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW   From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW   Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW    It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW   Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW    Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW   Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW    The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW    Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW   Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW    Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW   I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW     We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW     Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW     Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW   This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW    Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW    Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW    Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW   And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW    But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW    If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW   Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW   Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW   Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW    I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW    Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW    As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW    This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW    We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW   but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW    I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW    Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW   This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW    The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW    There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW    The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW    The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW    All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW   Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW    The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW    Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW    I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW    Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW    They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW   The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW    My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW    A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW   Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW    While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW    While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW    Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW    Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW     They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW    The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW   P. END
BEGIN NOW   S. END
BEGIN NOW    I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW   Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW   great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW   I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW    So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW    Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW    I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW    I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW    I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW    It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW    We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW     They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW    We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW   Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW   Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW    The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW    This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW    Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW     From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW     They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW     By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW     Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW    My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW    Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW    5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW   Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW    Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW    Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW    Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW    And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW    But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW    And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW    I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW    After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW    Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW    I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW   There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW    With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW    I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW    Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW   If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW    The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW   As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW    Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW    Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW   On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW    I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW    They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW    :(. END
BEGIN NOW   I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW    We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW    Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW    The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW     There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW    The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW    The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW    But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW   Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW   JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW    He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW   The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW    from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW    Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW   Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW    No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW    Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW     The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW   What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW    Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW    The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW    We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW    If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW    Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW     Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW    I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW    I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW    I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW    The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW    You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW   I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW    Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW   Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW    They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW    The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW    Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW    Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW   This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW    BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW    I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW    His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW    I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW    Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW    Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW    I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW    I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW    Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW    I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW   It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW     Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW    Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW   Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW   I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW     Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW    The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW    Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW    Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW   So. END
BEGIN NOW    much. END
BEGIN NOW    whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW    They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW    They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW   It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW    Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW    It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW    What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW    More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW    The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW    I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW    Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW   This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW     Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW     Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW   00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW   This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW   Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW   And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW   Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW   Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW   The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW   Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW   Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW   Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW   This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW    It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW    The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW    Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW   The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW   a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW    space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW    you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW   on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW   Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW    Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW    For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW    But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW    And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW    Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW    The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW    Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW    The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW    I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW    Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW    I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW    Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW    Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW    Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW    They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW    Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW    Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW   The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW    Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW    I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW    I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW    There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW    I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW    I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW    Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW     The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW   The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW   I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW     Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW   Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW   Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW     If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW     This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW     You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW   Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW   PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW     Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW   Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW   I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW   Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW    My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW   Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW   My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW     We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW   The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW     That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW     Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW   However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW     Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW    i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW   "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW     So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW   But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW     Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW   One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW     She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW     Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW     Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW   To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW     There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW     But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW    They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW    However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW   To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW     And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW     Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW   They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW    In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW    Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW    Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW   This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW    Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW    The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW    You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW    If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW    The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW    The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW    Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW    He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW    We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW    He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW    "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW    I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW    The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW    All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW    Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW    Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW   At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW    What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW    Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW    Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW    What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW   Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW     And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW   I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW   My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW   " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW      Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW     My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW     "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW   ". END
BEGIN NOW   Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW   From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW   Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW    It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW   Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW    Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW   Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW    The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW    Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW   Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW    Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW   I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW     We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW     Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW     Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW   This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW    Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW    Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW    Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW   And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW    But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW    If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW   Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW   Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW   Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW    I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW    The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW    Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW    As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW    This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW    We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW   but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW    I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW    Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW   This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW    The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW    There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW    The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW    The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW    All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW   Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW    The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW    Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW    I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW    Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW    They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW   The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW    My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW    A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW   Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW    While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW    While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW    Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW    Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW     They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW    The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW   P. END
BEGIN NOW   S. END
BEGIN NOW    I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW   Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW   great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW   I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW    So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW    Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW    I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW    I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW    I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW    It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW    We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW     They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW    We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW   Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW   Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW    The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW    This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW    Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW     From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW     They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW     By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW     Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW    My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW    Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW    5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW   Great dive bar with outdoor seating area - which is not a common thing in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW    Simple, straightforward drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    As with all dive bars, the bathrooms are not that clean, but you know, deal with it. END
BEGIN NOW    Also, there was a not-totally-stable seeming lady who was yelling at women in the restroom to get out of the toilet faster. END
BEGIN NOW    The outdoor seating area is really nice with some full trees for shade during the afternoons. END
BEGIN NOW    Also, they seem cool with letting you bring in outside food and there is a cuban place, pizza place and burger place adjacent to the H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW   I would give this place zero stars and the Abusive Bartender badge if I could, after witnessing some rather horrific and disturbing behavior from a male bartender on a female customer that was 100% unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW     Been going here for years, but after seeing that, never going back again. END
BEGIN NOW     Scary. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't go to this bar unless you wish to be attacked by a bartender. END
BEGIN NOW    One of the bartenders first ignored me, then when I asked for a beer, started screaming profanities at me and then actually put his hands on me and started pushing me around. END
BEGIN NOW    I can only imagine that if I had resisted him shoving me around, he would've quickly escalated to striking me, since none of this was provoked in any way. END
BEGIN NOW    I will never go back there again, even though I've been going there since they opened. END
BEGIN NOW    My friends are all boycotting this place because of this asshole, too. END
BEGIN NOW   Once a biker bar, now more hipster but the drinks are decent and the prices very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW    Only downside is everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh. END
BEGIN NOW    and cash only (although they have an atm)!. END
BEGIN NOW   The majority of the people at this bar have been nothing but gracious and courteous to me. END
BEGIN NOW    They've allowed me to bring in my dog, and it has been fine. END
BEGIN NOW    Tonight, a bartender on duty, someone that I had met on other visits, was in rare form. END
BEGIN NOW    He was discourteous. END
BEGIN NOW    He was argumentative. END
BEGIN NOW    He was mean. END
BEGIN NOW    I think he was belligerently drunk. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been a bartender and have managed bars and restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW    You can check my yelp history and how often I have written Yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW    Almost never. END
BEGIN NOW    If interested, you can ask me which restaurants or bars I've managed. END
BEGIN NOW    This sucked writing down one of my own, and I've never written a negative review of another bar before. END
BEGIN NOW    It was simply the most offensively I've ever been treated in any bar or restaurant, ever, before or after working in the industry. END
BEGIN NOW   I stopped by for the Prince tribute last week. END
BEGIN NOW     Got there fairly early, just before 5pm. END
BEGIN NOW    The CASH ONLY sign at the bar was an unpleasant surprise, and the ATM in the bar is one of those I just don't trust. END
BEGIN NOW    Its connection seemed spotty too, as a number of people had issues with errors all in a row. END
BEGIN NOW     I ended up borrowing cash from a friend rather than risk it. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent crowd; not packed and not empty. END
BEGIN NOW     The backyard was actually the fuller part because the weather was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends and I tried a couple of the drink specials which were Prince themed (either raspberry or purple, it seemed). END
BEGIN NOW     Nothing too incredible, but we enjoyed them nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a dive bar, not a cocktail lounge. END
BEGIN NOW     If you approach with that spirit, you'll have fun. END
BEGIN NOW   CASH ONLY (only downside, besides the parking meters which are ridiculously expensive). END
BEGIN NOW    $17 pitcher of Racer 5. END
BEGIN NOW    Great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll be back next time I'm in the area. END
BEGIN NOW   Two words: dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Personally, I'm a fan of the idea of dive bars. END
BEGIN NOW    I mean, who doesn't love cheap drinks? I know that I do. END
BEGIN NOW    Especially living in the Bay Area, anything that can keep some money in my pockets makes me pretty happy. END
BEGIN NOW   Cash. END
BEGIN NOW    Only. END
BEGIN NOW    Ouch. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm not someone who carries cash. END
BEGIN NOW    That makes it so I drink less at places like this. END
BEGIN NOW    It also has limited space inside. END
BEGIN NOW    I tend to run cool, so I like to be inside which can be rough when it's busy. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a pool table which is frequently occupied. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm no pool shark but I enjoy putting my terrible physics and geometry skills to use. END
BEGIN NOW   especially under the influence. END
BEGIN NOW    It's always a good idea. END
BEGIN NOW   So three stars. END
BEGIN NOW    It's close and easy to get to but nothing super fancy or spectacular, over the top service. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a dive bar so yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   expect that. END
BEGIN NOW   Dive bars are more my style. END
BEGIN NOW     This spot has some real charm. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome outdoor patio and smoking lounge. END
BEGIN NOW    All sorts of characters, friendly fast bartenders, cool decor, and just that nice fun weirdo vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only!. END
BEGIN NOW   like yelp said "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW   I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW   " I just don't feel safe or welcomed going into that place I will say the redeeming factor are the cute dogs just hanging out around their owners. END
BEGIN NOW   Jumped to my Top 5 favorite Bars I've ever been to. END
BEGIN NOW   Punk Bar with Pinball and great outside seating! Hell yeah! Service was good, prices were fair, and jukebox selection was On Point!. END
BEGIN NOW   This place seemed a little too much for my style when I first saw it from the outside (as it looks like your average hard core dive bar, often with motorcycle groups hanging around out front). END
BEGIN NOW    However I found it actually quite nice once I ventured inside. END
BEGIN NOW    The area I like best is the back patio, which has a nice beer garden feel. END
BEGIN NOW    I came here during the day but j can imagine it being a very poppin' place at night--it seems like a fun place to have drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Will come back again at night. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool place with a typical dive-bar vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only so be prepared - I almost wasn't! Outside was probably my favorite - a fair amount of seating, and they allow dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    The problem is that most dogs have owners, and some of those owners haven't trained their dog how to interact with other dogs. END
BEGIN NOW   Good drinks, bottled beer is probably the best bet. END
BEGIN NOW   it would be better with music at the Patio. END
BEGIN NOW   And gentrification is complete. END
BEGIN NOW     What used to be a laid back blues spot is now patronized by Hells Angels, never thought I  would see that at Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW     Gentrification : game, set, match. END
BEGIN NOW   It's good straight to the point bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I like to drink and they like to pour them, for a fee, of coarse. END
BEGIN NOW    It's my regular waterhole for the past 5 yrs or so. END
BEGIN NOW    They let you bring in outside food and it's one of the few places around that has a private patio to enjoy the nice weather and friends when the time calls for it. END
BEGIN NOW   Note: Be sure to hit an ATM because it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW   I love Heart and Dagger, yep it is a bar, but it is also the super sweet spot to shoot pool by my house, plus you can bring in your own food. END
BEGIN NOW   awesome! I came to the stairs in the front of the establishment and I looked up at them thinking, "Wow, how am I going to do this with one foot?"  The bouncer, Gary, was really cool, he helped get me up there so I could have fun inside with all the other bipeds. END
BEGIN NOW   lol. END
BEGIN NOW   There is always such a cool crowd at this place, no matter what you like. END
BEGIN NOW     The juke box offers some really great songs, the kind of songs that remind you of moments in your life that seemingly make you smile. END
BEGIN NOW     I think last night I heard an old "Wham" song that lifted my mood. END
BEGIN NOW    We watched a ton of Raider fans playing pool and basking in the glory of their win last night at the Battle of the Bay. END
BEGIN NOW     While the football game put my friend in a bad mood, the Raider fans were happy---let them have this little moment, it is not very often it happens ;)We attempted to go out to the patio in the back, and the ramp down into that area was yet another challenge for my one footed self. END
BEGIN NOW     But none to worry, there was a guy working at that back area too who helped me get around. END
BEGIN NOW     I have visited this spot for several years and have always had a memorable time--whether those memories be awesome, weird, annoying, ridiculous or fun, etc. END
BEGIN NOW   I always leave with a memory. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger is always on the crawl list for birthdays, and pretty much the "stand by" for any night. END
BEGIN NOW     We can play pool or pinball, listen to music, watch pretty disturbing movies on the TV, hang out in the patio, or just sit inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I am sure to run into friends from the neighborhood at any drop in, so that is always cool when I am out solo. END
BEGIN NOW     Stephani Smiles for HND ;). END
BEGIN NOW   Great place to have a beer and chill. END
BEGIN NOW    The outdoor patio is fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd give it 5 stars, but occasionally the clientele can get a little. END
BEGIN NOW    roudy. END
BEGIN NOW    And not in a good way. END
BEGIN NOW   The un-dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I used to like this place, but the clientele is all highbrow now. END
BEGIN NOW    I never liked that it was cash only, but I still love the jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW    The last time I was there the skinny bearded doorman kept shouting across the bar to the bartender which was super annoying. END
BEGIN NOW    I was unimpressed with his need for attention. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe early in the day this place is better but when it's crowded, nah. END
BEGIN NOW    I was particularly amused by the weather-denying girl in the tank top showing off her tattoos as everyone else in the bar was in a coat and scarf because it was freezing outside and they had all of the doors open. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe in 1992 that would be impressive, but in 2016 you are one of many. END
BEGIN NOW    Put your coat on, sweety. END
BEGIN NOW    You'll catch your death. END
BEGIN NOW   Terrible bar with terrible staff. END
BEGIN NOW    Rude door people causing fights with new patrons, and that was before anyone had a chance to order a drink. END
BEGIN NOW    Not sure how a business with such terrible customer service stays in business. END
BEGIN NOW    I wouldn't come back here again if you paid me!!. END
BEGIN NOW   Let me just say, I've been here only a handful of times. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't come here enough. END
BEGIN NOW   It reminds me of some of my favorite dives when I lived in the City, just wish I lived within walking distance ;)Great roadhouse atmosphere inside, and a chill backyard area. END
BEGIN NOW   Awesome place to come any day of week. END
BEGIN NOW    They pool tables and arcade games. END
BEGIN NOW    Cold beer on tab and bottled with a place to drink outside. END
BEGIN NOW    Mediocre pricing but they aren't shy on their pours. END
BEGIN NOW   This is my go to dive bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Super chill vibe, mostly locals, and cool kids. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a pool table, juke box and tables outside where you can bring the dogs, pizza and a board game. END
BEGIN NOW   what's not to like??Drinks are decent enough, I recommend sticking to beer, racer 5 on tap. END
BEGIN NOW   people seem to like the bloody Mary's and mimosa are perfect pre or post brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been here late at night and have had a completely different experience than now. END
BEGIN NOW    Today, we arrived at the bar closer to sunset and hung out on the patio with my $3 beer. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambiance and other patrons were really mellow and enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cheap, so that is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender, however, seemed to enjoy taking out her life's disappointments on the customers. END
BEGIN NOW    I would've rather served myself. END
BEGIN NOW    It won't keep me from returning, just yet. END
BEGIN NOW   My favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    They play great rock and roll inside, and the beer garden is a fantastic place to spend an afternoon, or play cards late into the night. END
BEGIN NOW    There's tons of food in the neighborhood that you can bring in, and they're dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    The pool scene is competitive and the table is better than average for a 'dive' bar (which the Dagger barely qualifies as). END
BEGIN NOW    There's a great mix of people from East Bay Rats to local yuppies to SF expat hipsters and everyone gets along. END
BEGIN NOW    It gets crowded but not too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW   Just don't sit at the end of the bar by the men's bathroom -- you'll only smell urinal cakes all night. END
BEGIN NOW    Unless you're into that I guess. END
BEGIN NOW   All hail the Duke! It was by the gracious invitation of His Majesty himself that the girlfriend &amp; I came to Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    &amp; what a lovely Dukedom it is. END
BEGIN NOW   The Heart &amp; Dagger is sort of a dive bar, sort of. END
BEGIN NOW    It's too well-lit inside to really be a total dive. END
BEGIN NOW    It's divey in a hipster-ish kind of way. END
BEGIN NOW    But the hipster to real people ratio isn't too high, so it's still cool. END
BEGIN NOW   Full bar, impressive booze selection, nice cocktails, decent brews on tap, great Happy Hour deals, pinball/ video games &amp; pool table inside, dog-friendly patio out back, &amp; motorcycle parking right in front off the street. END
BEGIN NOW    It's all good. END
BEGIN NOW   We had a chill time time sipping a few drinks (but only a few, it's cash only here, I had loads of plastic but not a whole lotta green on me) &amp; watching Markus' reign of terror on the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW    Until, at last, he was narrowly defeated by a very pretty young lady. END
BEGIN NOW    Who says chivalry is dead?Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    I like it. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll have to return as often as possible to see the Duke, his fair Dukedom &amp; any other shenanigans afoot. END
BEGIN NOW   Made my way over to oakland to meet up some friends at this sweet lil spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Surrounded by plenty of parking and food it was a nice change up from SF. END
BEGIN NOW    It is a cash only bar some come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW    Full bar with some good beer on tap, and one dude holding down the fort on a saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW    ( he was wicked fast). END
BEGIN NOW    Outside is a sweet lil patio for a awesome place to relax and chat( bench seating) and the fresh air was great. END
BEGIN NOW    The prices for drinks were right on, and no overly pricey with some good pours. END
BEGIN NOW   Cheap drinks, outdoor space, punk rock music -- YES. END
BEGIN NOW   You can smoke. END
BEGIN NOW    Here. END
BEGIN NOW    And drink. END
BEGIN NOW    A nice well whisky and a good pour. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW    They check ID very professionally. END
BEGIN NOW    The people who work there are people, not hipster asshats or attitudinal testosteronies. END
BEGIN NOW    i like it, if you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW    Ahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW   I can see this place is going to be my favorite bar in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW   -Great bartender, totally personable and cool. END
BEGIN NOW   -Cool door guy, huge laugh!-Great patio, the likes of which are hard to find around here. END
BEGIN NOW   -Giant Lemons. END
BEGIN NOW   -Good mix of all types at the bar, everyone in a good mood. END
BEGIN NOW   -Drinks were reasonably priced and poured strong. END
BEGIN NOW   -It' close to my house. END
BEGIN NOW   Basically everything needed in a bar that's going to be seeing a lot of this face. END
BEGIN NOW   This place definitely has the dive bar feel to it. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm sure this is a good local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW     What really appeals to me about this places is the outside area in the back. END
BEGIN NOW     There are plenty of tables to sit at. END
BEGIN NOW     Great place to go with some friends to relax with a beer and chat. END
BEGIN NOW      Although it does get busy and filled up so no guarantee you will get a table. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a casual grungy type scene so jeans and causal attire is the standard. END
BEGIN NOW     I like the location and the vibe here though--super chill and relaxed. END
BEGIN NOW     There are a couple pool tables inside as well inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd definitely go back for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW   "Oh, he's very popular Ed. END
BEGIN NOW    The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. END
BEGIN NOW    They think he's a righteous dude. END
BEGIN NOW   "-- from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"A visit to Heart &amp; Dagger often reminds me of these words. END
BEGIN NOW    As watering holes go, it may not be for every body, but it has a strikingly wide array of fans. END
BEGIN NOW    And for us fans, it holds a piece of our hearts. END
BEGIN NOW    The vibe is casual (read: 'divey'), distinctly Oakland, with a wild undercurrent befitting a David Lynch film. END
BEGIN NOW    A biker bar only 'modestly' gentrified by neo-Oaklandites/wannabees/over-incomed geeks, to which I confess a partial complicity. END
BEGIN NOW     The playground segments into roughly three arenas:  (1) Bar area, where the bees get their honey -- and the barkeeps, both efficient and commanding, do a great job keeping the drones and workers happy. END
BEGIN NOW    Beer specials and shots of liquor are an excellent value, especially during HH, when my lovely Bulliet Manhattans are especially generous. END
BEGIN NOW    (2) Patio, definitely favored by the dog-partnered and smoking clientele, and seems to collect the more regular patrons. END
BEGIN NOW    Gossip is overheard, smiles are witnessed, wafting cigarette smoke is inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW    Water from two giant ThermosTM coolers is free and easily accessed for both two and four-legged visitors back here. END
BEGIN NOW   And then there is (3), the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW     Where I learned, thanks to tutelage from billiards Maestro M and a few tips from other regulars, to now actually almost *not* suck at pool-playing. END
BEGIN NOW     Back to (3) in a bit. END
BEGIN NOW    For the bar en masse though: at its heart of gold though does push the tip of its dagger, as visits here have not always been a feel-good utopian experience. END
BEGIN NOW    I've seen people verbally insulted or kicked out for debatable reasons by the staff (actually mostly just one staff member, whose shifts are minimal); heard obnoxious comments by drunk and/or loud bigots; spied sketchy characters sporting knives in their back pocket, and witnessed a few "lively" disagreements over 8-ball. END
BEGIN NOW    Admittedly, H&amp;D is an onion with many layers, and not all those layers are pretty. END
BEGIN NOW     The trifling edginess is in reality as much an allure as a downer, and a metaphor and microcosm of our world and city and a reminder that good or bad you're still a part of it so why not be a positive part or at the very least learn how to deal with it? In reality, I don't wax all philosophic like that when I visit here. END
BEGIN NOW    Which brings us back to (3):  I do, truly, enjoy the regular pool players, and the competition and camaraderie I'm fortunate to have shared. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm a square peg for several reasons in H&amp;D, but the bonding with other such pegs or non-pegs is the reason I love to visit. END
BEGIN NOW    And on those visits, I get to practice my shot, nurse my bourbon, and inhale the simple sideways joys that life has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW   Can one sum up H&amp;D in a single catchphrase?  "All for one, one for all, just watch your wallet and drink. END
BEGIN NOW   " "You don't have to be a biker to come, but it don't hurt if you are one. END
BEGIN NOW   " "A bar of inimitable substance and a multitude of substances. END
BEGIN NOW   " Nah . END
BEGIN NOW    screw that. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger defies an easy Yelp review description. END
BEGIN NOW    And I'm guessing they like it that way. END
BEGIN NOW    Just be chill, be respectful, be unorthodox, be free, and be yourself. END
BEGIN NOW    It's not to be analyzed. END
BEGIN NOW    Just enjoyed. END
BEGIN NOW   If you like dive bars without the meth mouth, Sons of Anarchy watching patrons, Heart and Dagger will sit very well with you. END
BEGIN NOW    (It's kind of not really even a dive bar, shh)They *are* cash only. END
BEGIN NOW    There is an ATM with a $2. END
BEGIN NOW   25 fee, but you get that back fast because their drinks are so stinkin' cheap-- and strong!There is a pool table room and (the best part), an amazing outdoor patio that is friendly to your cigarette smoking buds. END
BEGIN NOW    It's kind of the perfect place to be on a summer night. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart &amp; Dagger is a solid go-to bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Come here once &amp; you'll likely become a regular. END
BEGIN NOW   one of my favorite places! cheap drinks, good people, a big back patio that is open late. END
BEGIN NOW    Home made beef jerky, aweful/good movies playing and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    also hosted by some of the best bartenders/doormen you'll meet. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, almost forgot. END
BEGIN NOW    they have three pinball machines (including walking dead) and a decent pooltable with a good/honest rotation of players. END
BEGIN NOW   Love heart and dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    My go to spot when I need a very laid back, wind down, kind of day. END
BEGIN NOW   I drink too much. END
BEGIN NOW     I came to that realization, drunk, during a disappointing pizza experience (why the fuck my bf drove us all the way to oakland for pizza who knows?)   What to do at 11pm on weeknight, drunk, concerned about how you will pay for Betty Ford and in Oakland?Heart and Dagger saloon. END
BEGIN NOW   Sure, my boyfriend tells me he loves pizza more than me. END
BEGIN NOW    Get me drink. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank the Lord in Heaven he volunteered to DD. END
BEGIN NOW   As Kevin B. END
BEGIN NOW    mentioned, if the Zeitgeist is too far of a hoof to get to, then H and D will do. END
BEGIN NOW     The back yard is pretty big and decked with communal tables for both large and small group outings. END
BEGIN NOW     We arrived armed with IDs out (although no one, but NO ONE in my party looked even remotely underage) and was met with friendly banter from the door man no. END
BEGIN NOW    1. END
BEGIN NOW     At one point I couldn't find my friends--not like the place is really that big, so I blame jet-lag for my confusion--and went back out onto the street to look for them. END
BEGIN NOW     Door man no. END
BEGIN NOW    2 had all the charm of a TSA agent upon my re-entry not 2 minutes later. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe he thought I was some a-hole ABC cop trying to pull a fast one on him?  I wish the US could just lighten up a bit on ID checking, but I get why they can't. END
BEGIN NOW     Anyway, this place is an interesting replacement for The Serenader, if, however, not in keeping with the vibe of that which existed for decades in this very spot. END
BEGIN NOW     -a place where bitchin' BBQ reigned in the backyard and my white face was a minority. END
BEGIN NOW   Great dive bar to drink at on a hot summer afternoon - The big back patio is usually bustling, but not too crowded to get a seat at a table (usually). END
BEGIN NOW     Good beer selection, good service, good prices. END
BEGIN NOW     Ive seen people set up picnics on the patio tables so it's pretty cool that they let you do that. END
BEGIN NOW    Great place to hang out. END
BEGIN NOW   Me likes. END
BEGIN NOW     Outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone has a dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Clean restrooms. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     Good music. END
BEGIN NOW     Pool table and PIN BALL!  Don't try to bring chicken wings from Hot wings with bones. END
BEGIN NOW     Wilkie will not let you in. END
BEGIN NOW     The dogs are very important. END
BEGIN NOW   I was Chilling at the Slab when I get a Text from my Yelp Minister of Fun John Z to join the Posse at H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    So I jumped into my Whip Black Beauty and rolled to Oak town . END
BEGIN NOW    I grabbed a parking spot right across the street. END
BEGIN NOW     Tip 1 no parking lot just street parking. END
BEGIN NOW   So I roll in and see John Z and Markus dominating the Pool Table. END
BEGIN NOW    Anne Marie shooting Deer in the Arcade. END
BEGIN NOW    Home Sweet Home. END
BEGIN NOW    Yelp Posse in full effect. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice Big Bar ,Friendly Bartenders ,LCD TVs for Entertainment and a Cool Back Patio for Summer Nights or Days. END
BEGIN NOW   A wide selection of Beers and a cool retro Juke box adds to the Charm of H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW   Great meeting Spot or a Friendly game of Pool H&amp;D is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW   Tip 2 They allow outside food in. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW    2$ canned beer and really nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are looking to meet up with a group of friends this place has a really big patio with plenty of space. END
BEGIN NOW    Also it is cash only, so be ready for that. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved coming here and will be back. END
BEGIN NOW   This is a neat, inexpensive, kind of gnarly bar in downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely worth popping in! Don't mind the aggressive music and cool/weird stuff on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW   Value for Money: 4 StarsCustomer Service: 4 StarsAmbience: 2 Stars (markdown for hipsters!)Location: 4 Stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Heart and Dagger Saloon appeals to my mysterious and cheap side. END
BEGIN NOW    everyday prices are cheap, HH is a bit cheaper. END
BEGIN NOW   lots of entertainment options: pool table, pinball machines, video machines, juke box, flat screens. END
BEGIN NOW    drink: gin &amp; tonic(4)-pretty strongguinness black lager(4)just so-soon draught:-happy hours(m-f, 4-7), $3 drafts, 3. END

BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW   -many patrons wear leather and tats. END
BEGIN NOW    clientele on the edge of heavy metal. END
BEGIN NOW   This bar has a genuine rock 'n' roll atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   Ah such a gem. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend took me here to play pool about a month ago and now I go about once a week. END
BEGIN NOW    There is usually rock music playing and something weird on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW    However, If there is a game on then it will be on the TVs. END
BEGIN NOW    They have pool and a couple of arcade games like pinball and buck hunter. END
BEGIN NOW    They have an awesome outside patio with a bunch of picnic tables. END
BEGIN NOW     You can take drinks outside and people can smoke out there too. END
BEGIN NOW   You can bring your dog! There are usually at least two dogs in the place which is so awesome. END
BEGIN NOW    CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM. END
BEGIN NOW   No food, but there are food places next door and you can bring food in. END
BEGIN NOW    Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Well, my Yelp buddy Max has been going here for a while, and given that it's a six-minute walk from my house, I really have no excuse for not getting here sooner. END
BEGIN NOW    Anyway, I've seen the light! This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW    Pool tables are so rare here in NorCal! And a patio!And this place is right next to the parking are under the 580!. END
BEGIN NOW   Decent prices, nice patio when it's warm outside. END
BEGIN NOW   They allow dogs which is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW   Good spot to hang low. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a saloon. END
BEGIN NOW   My head hurts, and it has nothing to do with what I drank last night. END
BEGIN NOW     Water; I should start learning to drink more water. END
BEGIN NOW     But what's a poor girl to do when a bar insists on serving her most favourite whiskey at such amazing prices??Heart &amp; Dagger - For years, I'd walked by this place too afraid of my own shadow to venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW     Then one day, I came across a photo someone took of the outside and discovered that they kicked it up a few dozen notches on their curbside appeal. END
BEGIN NOW     Then, The C. END
BEGIN NOW    made me meet him here before showtime. END
BEGIN NOW     Who knew that it would become a small trend?I now can proudly say that I overcame my misguided fears and have found a sweet little spot on the ever changing face of Lakeshore Ave to call home. END
BEGIN NOW     This bar is perfect in its divey-ness, has a huge patio for perfect summer evenings, a nice little pool table that only costs $1 a game, and has an awesome jukebox that plays Flogging Molly and David Bowie!  Plus, the prices on the drinks are super inexpensive, and the bartenders are more than kindly souls that'll make you think of Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW   You, too, should overcome your fears and check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel myself lucky to have been introduced. END
BEGIN NOW   Always fun. END
BEGIN NOW   dive bar with a great crowd!!! Cash only FYI. END
BEGIN NOW    Dog friendly which is cool and outside private patio. END
BEGIN NOW   great place!!!. END
BEGIN NOW   This establishment is hateful. END
BEGIN NOW    I have never been treated so rudely. END
BEGIN NOW    I bought one drink and tried to take a picture on my 21st birthday and the customers and employees were malicious in a creepy way. END
BEGIN NOW    There was no wrong doing on my part, and yet my friend and I were assaulted by the bouncer and he tried to kick my friend. END
BEGIN NOW    All we wanted to do was take a picture which we were told was okay, but the customers sitting around the mural were egotistical. END
BEGIN NOW    Instead of the bouncer helping us get a picture he told us to take, he was on the side of the rude customer. END
BEGIN NOW    We just wanted to have a good time but that's obviously not possible there. END
BEGIN NOW    They were nothing but a bunch of creepy douche bags. END
BEGIN NOW    Good luck at this bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I would give this place 0 stars, if I could. END
BEGIN NOW   When Zeitgeist is just too far away. END
BEGIN NOW   The Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon wins on the name alone, but on a sunny day after a picnic on Lake Merritt, it's a great place to relax with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Like Zeitgeist across the bay, it's got a biker motif and strong beer on tap, along with a popular backyard for catching up with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    This place also has pool tables and a well-stocked jukebox (also like Zeitgeist), so it's better designed for long stays instead of a quick drink, and the crowd gets friendlier as the afternoon goes on. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're having a thirsty afternoon in the East Bay, quench here. END
BEGIN NOW   Sooo ran to Heart and Dagger for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW    After a long day. END
BEGIN NOW    Stood there while the ex zz top member bartender serves about 5 people that came in after I did. END
BEGIN NOW    he finally notices my 6'5 dude . END
BEGIN NOW    And I "wave" to motion "over here" . END
BEGIN NOW    Since I'm paying. END
BEGIN NOW   He emulates my wave . END
BEGIN NOW   extra dramatic then begins to reprimand me tell me to never wave at him again or he will just ignore me . END
BEGIN NOW    I said well I just waved cause you asked the guy I'm with what he wanted and I'm buying sooo. END
BEGIN NOW   He said NO SERIOUSLY I DONT CARE. END
BEGIN NOW   I wish I had a drink in my hand so I could throw it on him. END
BEGIN NOW   FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW    And especially THAT BARTENDER . END
BEGIN NOW   I miss places where black people were allowed and treated with the same respect as the transplants . END
BEGIN NOW   He felt completely justified coming at the ONLY black couple in the bar like that. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe I'm sensitive but really FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW    May it burn to the ground and be resurrected as the serenader again . END
BEGIN NOW   One word for this establishment. END
BEGIN NOW    RACIST. END
BEGIN NOW    We are professional, well educated, LATINO couple in our 40's, born &amp; raised in SF and have lived in Lake Merritt for 10 years. END
BEGIN NOW    We decided to have a beer on a Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW    The tattooed, black haired female bartender took our orders, delivered our beers. END
BEGIN NOW   then THREW OUR CHANGE at us, for no apparent reason. END
BEGIN NOW    Then the heavy set tattooed bartender says KICK ROCKS. END
BEGIN NOW    For those of you who are not familiar with this term. END
BEGIN NOW    Urban Dictionary definition: F*** OFF or GET OUTTA HERE. END
BEGIN NOW    Shocked and utterly disgusted people like this exist in OAKLAND? REALLY? Thought we were imaging this, but Nope. END
BEGIN NOW    Just read all the HIDDEN reviews, exactly the same. END
BEGIN NOW    Bottom line. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're brown or black. END
BEGIN NOW    Don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW    THIS ESTABLISHMENT TREATS MINORITIES LIKE GARBAGE. END
BEGIN NOW   Still the most awesomest bar in town!Don't go with attitude and you won't get none, epic back patio and cheap drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    Better like friendly dogs, if not don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a super dog lovin' joint, if you fear them stay away and don't complain about them being there. END
BEGIN NOW   consider yourself warned. END
BEGIN NOW   Props to Suzy, Allison and Eric. END
BEGIN NOW   damn the whole crew over there makes my day. END
BEGIN NOW    Just pour me a strong drink, talk like a dirty sailor and I'm yours!A Quality, respectful stand up business. END
BEGIN NOW   all haters can walk the plank!!!xoxo!. END
BEGIN NOW   Great bar to play pool and just meet new people. END
BEGIN NOW    Very pet friendly and easy going great jukebox music and a spacious outdoor seating area. END
BEGIN NOW   pretty hipster bar a great improvement from the old bar it use to be. END
BEGIN NOW   She suggested we meet at this bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I heard about it before and without context imagined it to be a seedy dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I arrived first and sat at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender was nice, the drinks were very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    My beer wasn't as cold as I would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW    The crowd was definitely a varied mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW    I walked around, and checked out the back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    Then decided, this is cool place. END
BEGIN NOW    My date showed up we had a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender randomly brought us a couple of free drinks to taste. END
BEGIN NOW    One thing led to another and we left together. END
BEGIN NOW    (It must have been the Funky Cold Medina)I would definitely like to come back and recommend this bar. END
BEGIN NOW   This is the only bar I like in my hood the bartenders actually remember who you are and always treat you friendly regardless of how busy they are. END
BEGIN NOW    The mixed drinks are always good and the beers is always nice and cold. END
BEGIN NOW     I always love when summer is around because it's fun to see what the guest keg will be. END
BEGIN NOW    The music is always great and the movies they play on the background are always entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice vibe and cool place to grab a beer and play a few games on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a giant outdoor patio with tons of tables in the back and lots of arcade games and a pool table inside. END
BEGIN NOW    It was kind of crowded when we went, so it took a while to find a seat and we didn't end up staying long enough to play pool but I would be down to come back and play a few rounds. END
BEGIN NOW   Enjoy being able to sit out back and enjoy the beers. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly staff is always a plus. END
BEGIN NOW   Soft opening tonight. END
BEGIN NOW     Big Daddy on draft. END
BEGIN NOW     Free Lanesplitter pizza. END
BEGIN NOW     Great friends and deep conversation. END
BEGIN NOW     If I didn't have a 10 month at home, I might find myself here MUCH more often. END
BEGIN NOW     Wish you were there Ben. END
BEGIN NOW    :(On the way out I saw local newsletter wordsmith Ken Katz. END
BEGIN NOW     He was enjoying a Negra Modelo and surveying the territory. END
BEGIN NOW     He asked me what I thought and said he looked forward to my Yelp review. END
BEGIN NOW     This one is for you Ken!  Keep up the good confabulation. END
BEGIN NOW     See you in the hood. END
BEGIN NOW   If you like Lucky 13 or Lost Weekend in Alameda, you will love Heart and Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     Check 'er out!. END
BEGIN NOW   One star for every sip of beer before my dog and I got booted. END
BEGIN NOW   She was barking at another dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Which I get is annoying and cause for concern. END
BEGIN NOW    But she was only barking because she was leashed, and wanted to go greet the other dog. END
BEGIN NOW    And she was only leashed because within a minute of walking in I was told I had to leash her. END
BEGIN NOW    Which would have been fine and fair except that no other dogs were leashed. END
BEGIN NOW    Which puts my girl in a weird situation where everyone else is meeting and greeting and she's tied down in a corner. END
BEGIN NOW     Hence the barking. END
BEGIN NOW    I kind of wanted to point all this out at the time, but it's been my experience that nothing good comes from arguing with bouncers, so we left. END
BEGIN NOW    Which sucks! For the 3 minutes we were there it seemed like a cool little dive. END
BEGIN NOW    We live around the corner, and I was hoping this could be our end up after walks around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been there a few times and now I live a few blocks behind it so I'll be there a few times more. END
BEGIN NOW   Trumer and a burger from next door. END
BEGIN NOW   Kwik Way is theshit andthis place is lucky to be next door. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a fine bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent. END
BEGIN NOW   Dog central park today in the back. END
BEGIN NOW   But I got a burger and a beer,so nocomplaints. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is cool if you are a trite, predictable cliché of a hipster / fauxpunk. END
BEGIN NOW    If you like waiting 20 minutes for mediocre service and a can of PBR at 500% mark-up, please come on down to Heart and Dagger!Idiots are more than welcome to enjoy pretending at rebellion while leaning on broken, unusable pin ball machines. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't forget that we offer a special discount if you are one of those girls with no particular talent and so you take your clothing off on stage assuming that means you're a burlesque dancer. END
BEGIN NOW    Please hold your next "desperate for mom's attention" meeting here and get a free pitcher of horse piss! I mean Tecate!. END
BEGIN NOW   I used to like this place!  What the crap happened?  The bartender wasn't just rude, it was some whole other level of maximum hatred!  Did she think I was someone else?  Someone who had stolen her husband, killed her dog, and burned down her house?  Because that's what it felt like. END
BEGIN NOW     Damn. END
BEGIN NOW   After eventually getting a beer, we head over to play the pinball machines and they are in such a sorry state as to basically be a total ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger, I can take a hint. END
BEGIN NOW     You don't want me to come there and spend my money, so I shant. END
BEGIN NOW   Okay, I admit I was only in here for 15 minutes, meeting friends before seeing a movie at the Grand Lake Theatre. END
BEGIN NOW     However, for a dive bar it's not really divey at all. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes, it's dark and has pool tables. END
BEGIN NOW    But everyone is really nice and the place is clean and not skeazy. END
BEGIN NOW    Not only that but there's a great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    There's lots of bike parking out front and they don't mind if you lock up onto the railing either. END
BEGIN NOW    The bouncer didn't give me any grief about running in then out, parking my bike right next to the front door (I asked if it was okay) and then leaving again without actually getting a drink. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely recommended as a nice neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinks are inexpensive and stiff . END
BEGIN NOW   Cash only is a  bit irritating. END
BEGIN NOW   Only one toilet Plenty of seating outside . END
BEGIN NOW   I felt comfortable here and I think that it was because everyone was so friendly and engaging. END
BEGIN NOW    I should remember to visit that side of the lake for a more often especially if I'm in the mood for mustaches, boys who ride bikes , tattoos and a slick comb over, oh wait. END
BEGIN NOW   that is like. END
BEGIN NOW    all day , everyday. END
BEGIN NOW    Welp, alrighty then. END
BEGIN NOW   LOVE this bar!  It's charmingly divey, without being disgusting. END
BEGIN NOW   unlike this one bar I went to recently who's name I will not mention where patrons just dropped trou' and urinated all over the bloody patio - sorry, but that's just nasty. END
BEGIN NOW    I digress. END
BEGIN NOW    H&amp;D's bartenders are hella' friendly and they pour heavy. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously, I can typically hold my booze pretty well and one $10 pint-glass-sized-long-island had me buzzing preeetty hard. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a pool table that's almost always occupied by friendly people who are happy to work you into the rotation, puppies! (yes, puppies. END
BEGIN NOW    It's dog-friendly), a nice outdoor patio for the smokers, tasty food just next door, a jukebox, arcade games, and an ATM machine (they don't take cards). END
BEGIN NOW     It's really nice to have this bar within walking distance of our house. END
BEGIN NOW     It's by far the best neighborhood bar I've experienced yet. END
BEGIN NOW   For saving my arse literally. END
BEGIN NOW    And having clean facilites. END
BEGIN NOW   I had  Trader's Joes and was loaded up with my bags when the urge hit to use the Bathroom like super bad like Damn I wish I had on a Diaper Bad like I might have to take a shit right here right now on the sidewalk and be on the bus hella shitty- like ( and deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW    I dropped my bags and rushed into the Bar praying it would be friendly and not you-gotta buy-to shit. END
BEGIN NOW    I was id checked ( I do look like a kid) and raced to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW    Praying no body else would have to come in cause the bathroom was super tiny with one stall and no way to pretend the stink wasn't emerging from me. END
BEGIN NOW   And there it goes a female patron enters just as I uh let go. END
BEGIN NOW    Can't help but smell that!-Sigh- Oh well I am grateful it went down this way and not on the bus (feeling deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW   Well made, quality drinks with a cool dive bar feel. END
BEGIN NOW    There's pinball and pool which makes it great for bro-nights. END
BEGIN NOW    The patrons are stylish and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    I really like the back patio area. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is very cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Great drinks and service. END
BEGIN NOW     Next time I hope to get a spot on the über-cool patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't remember the last time I had booze and played the video game Galaga (spelling?) Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW   This used to be the go-to bar for my friends and fellow Bay Area Derby girls. END
BEGIN NOW    It was our hang out, we've given them a lot of business. END
BEGIN NOW    But then today after a beautiful sunny day and a skate around the lake we decided to stop in for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW    We looked on the outside for any sign about "no shoes, no service" but there wasn't one so we went in. END
BEGIN NOW    Two of us had shoes, I did not. END
BEGIN NOW    We proceeded to order our drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    We saw a cute dog sitting on a bar stool and gave it some love. END
BEGIN NOW    I got my beer and then a manager type abruptly told us we had to take our skates off, so we did. END
BEGIN NOW    My friends and I grabbed our drinks and headed to the beer garden in the back (me in my socks). END
BEGIN NOW    I took a few sips of my refreshing beer and Miss Cranky Pants told me that I must be wearing *shoes* or I have to leave. END
BEGIN NOW    I did not have shoes so I got my money back from my beer and left the premises. END
BEGIN NOW    It's too bad the woman was so prickly. END
BEGIN NOW    The woman could've been much friendlier and more professional in her approach towards us but she treated the three of us with such disdain that it left us confused and surprised about her behavior. END
BEGIN NOW    There was no sign posted about shoes in the front (only a sign about a 2 drink minimum). END
BEGIN NOW   they allow dogs in the establishment and they allow people to smoke pot AND there is no handicap access to the establishment. END
BEGIN NOW   but somehow stocking feet is not acceptable? Would they ban people in bare feet wearing flip-flops? The rules just seem a little off and we certainly didn't deserve the rude treatment. END
BEGIN NOW    Me, my friends, and the Bay Area Derby girls will not be returning to the Heart &amp; Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW   Proud to say this is my neighborhood bar! Love the atmosphere, puppy dogs and staff!. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't usually review bars, but I loooooove Heart and Dagger! Beers are yummy, drinks are pretty good, but the best part is the patio. END
BEGIN NOW    People bring their dogs back there, it's awesome!We'll usually come here and chill in the patio, maybe play some pin ball, then move to the next bar. END
BEGIN NOW    We usually hit up Lanesplitter Pizza afterwords because it's so closeby. END
BEGIN NOW    Delish. END
BEGIN NOW   Bah! This bar has so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes! Go on a sunday and get mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW    Sit out in the patio, and enjoy your day. END
BEGIN NOW    then go wander to the lake and stare at the hobo geese eating cigarette butts. END
BEGIN NOW   Noooooo, don't go on a regular night. END
BEGIN NOW    the shape of the place is sooo weird and awkward, either you're in the way of the pool table or standing by a pole in the front, squeezed by the bar, or freezing in the back patio slowly absorbing lung cancer. END
BEGIN NOW    I asked for a gin and tonic and got soda and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW    talk about the most extreme of a buzz kill. END
BEGIN NOW     Soda is the hill billy cousin to city gal tonic. END
BEGIN NOW    Also, just because this bar is called Heart &amp; Dagger doesn't mean you get to be a mean jerk. END
BEGIN NOW   I repeat, get week-end day drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool, neighborhood-y bar with a lovely back patio area, a friendly staff and a great selection of beers and booze. END
BEGIN NOW   There's good affordable food nearby and the place is usually filled with friendly locals. END
BEGIN NOW   I dig it!. END
BEGIN NOW   So, my friend just moved to the bay area from good ol' NYC, and we decide to have a night out on the town, to welcome her to Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Granted, we're both tired and lame after a week of work, so a night out on the town ends up consisting of one drink then home. END
BEGIN NOW   HOWEVER. END
BEGIN NOW   My one drink was a super cheap aged Jameson, and hers was a super cheap PBR tallboy. END
BEGIN NOW     WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW   We met my friend there whose pet pug (I'm sorry, he's a service dog, for real) is a regular at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously, he sits on a bar stool. END
BEGIN NOW     WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW   We headed out back where it was beautiful outside, despite being the end of October. END
BEGIN NOW     WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW   On the back patio, my friend starts getting agitated. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't know why. END
BEGIN NOW     I realize it's because half the people here are not just smoking cigarettes, and where she's been living, that's still illegal. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean, technically, it is here too, but really: WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW   Heart and Dagger is a great dive bar located near the historic Grand Lake Theater, conveniently nestled amongst other eateries and shops. END
BEGIN NOW   - easy going vibe- back patio- outside food friendly (you can bring your own)- dog friendly-  fun (pinball, pool table, juke box)- be sure to bring photo ID - i. END
BEGIN NOW   e. END
BEGIN NOW    license, passport. END
BEGIN NOW    State law requires that every patron have one (even if you look 21+) otherwise they get fined big time. END
BEGIN NOW   - cash only (ATM on the premises). END
BEGIN NOW   CASH ONLY! cool patio in the back and cool staff. END
BEGIN NOW    nice local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW    it's very low key and chill. END
BEGIN NOW    i'd go back if i was in the area and it was happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW   Went on a whim after a friend recommed the place to me. END
BEGIN NOW   I had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW    and too much to drink. END
BEGIN NOW   lol. END
BEGIN NOW    they ordered me a cab and someone offered to move my car for me since they had street sweeping early the next morning. END
BEGIN NOW   what a nice thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW   I would totally go back the vibe was pretty cool and the bartender was great. END
BEGIN NOW   biker looking guy with a goatee. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd like to give props but, I can't remember his name. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW   Well, this was a fun night!  A little dive-y, dark, and grungy, but I live down the street and have always wanted to see inside!  I ended up getting a mimosa for 4$ (I think. END
BEGIN NOW   ) which was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     The back patio is pretty cool, but I couldn't stay long because it was beyond freezing the night I went. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, do you think it might be a good idea to put lights outside?  Or, more lights outside?  I mean, its cool and all to sit and drink in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW    but more fun to see the person you came with!  I really prefer the two seater RIGHT by the windows inside by the bar- so quaint and cozy!I read they once had a mechanical bull. END
BEGIN NOW    am I wrong?  If they did, crowds would multiply, and I would be there every Sat!. END
BEGIN NOW   Decent place, but the bartender could certainly have been less of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW   What other bar would explicitly say on their website that their mission is to have cheap drinks with no cover?Hey, Yelp stalkers (that are dwindling in numbers every day)! Want to stalk for reals? I'm here every Friday without fail because this bar is so freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW    Though it's not on the ridiculously cheap Happy Hour special list ($3 drafts and well drinks), their Dirty Martinis are some of the best I've ever had (still at a super cheap price!). END
BEGIN NOW   Do yourself a favor and get there early to snag a seat on the outdoor patio under the lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW    The Heart and Dagger has friendly service (I need not mention their predecessors), friendly patrons, and an all together relaxed and fun vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only, and watch out. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll probably steal your seat on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW   Eek! Methinks not. END
BEGIN NOW   That's exactly how I feel about this place, and the bartender helped out with that feeling. END
BEGIN NOW     By the way this is no Zeitgeist!  That's like calling Taco Bell authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW     Anyway. END
BEGIN NOW   Me and my lady walked in Sunday late evening around 7ish not packed but there was people. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought the layout was nice, games are cool, and yes the Jukebox is the God of Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     Trust me if it weren't for that jukebox they might have got 1 star. END
BEGIN NOW     Ordered tequila with club soda and a bloody mary for the first round. END
BEGIN NOW     Hmmm I've had better and I wasn't feeling the bartenders dry attitude. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not like I wanted her to do cart wheels but damn girl smile at least. END
BEGIN NOW     We stepped outside to feel the vibe out there since there wasn't much of a vibe at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Beautiful lemon tree, plenty of awkward seating, and a big bummer is you can't hear the music outside. END
BEGIN NOW     We decided one more drink and depending on the bartenders attitude we would decide if we where going to stay or leave. END
BEGIN NOW   Shot of Fernet please and one more tequila with club soda. END
BEGIN NOW     I received what seemed like half a shot for 6 bucks and a half ass thanks. END
BEGIN NOW     The guy next to me ordered a shot of Fernet too and it was beyond obvious his shot was double what was in my glass. END
BEGIN NOW     Whatevs I finished my shot and left. END
BEGIN NOW     You guys can all have this place cause it ain't fulfilling my drunk lover needs. END
BEGIN NOW   From the outside, it looks like someone simply converted their quaint little house into a public bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Inside is a bit more rock n roll, loud music and pool. END
BEGIN NOW    $2 PBR tallies make pretty much any hole in the wall a worthwhile stop for a drink or two. END
BEGIN NOW    The back patio is perfect for a summer evening but gets crowded fast as most of the room out there is taken by tables. END
BEGIN NOW    Dog friendly despite not having the friendliest of dogs. END
BEGIN NOW   You know what I like? Booze. END
BEGIN NOW    You know what else I like? A bar that will give me said booze at a price that won't break my wallet (Ummmm, hello? Uptown? Your $8. END
BEGIN NOW   00 Maker's shot can eat a bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW   )This place is totally going to hit five stars soon. END
BEGIN NOW    There are still a lot of small details that are getting worked out but you know what? The owners are hands on and working on them. END
BEGIN NOW    I see them there almost every single night greeting people, talking to them about improvements. END
BEGIN NOW    hell, I even saw one of them leave their guests they had come in with to help one of their bartenders who had gotten slammed and lost in the weeds. END
BEGIN NOW   I've read the accusations of this place being racist and I just don't know what the hell you people are talking about. END
BEGIN NOW    I can go on about it but giving it any more space than two sentences is giving credence to a line of bullshit that is just reDONKulous. END
BEGIN NOW    There are few places in Oakland that I've found that allow me to feel comfortable with a wide array of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    I can have this as my place to start the night, spend the night, or end the night. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh - did I mention that Lanesplitters usually drops off pizza when they close? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW    free drunk food. END
BEGIN NOW    All you one-star givers can join to Uptown on eating their bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW   I knew I would like this place when this was on the juke box while I entered youtube. END
BEGIN NOW   com/watch?v=BIvk… There was once a time when this place was the Serenader and that place scared the daylights out of me. END
BEGIN NOW    The patrons would shout at me when I walked past and I figured that heckling/intimidating patrons with the potential to scare off customers and I totally wrote about it on Yelp and it was #$%&amp;ING FLAGGED AND REMOVED because I violated TOS. END
BEGIN NOW    Well, ha, it took two years for them to pull it. END
BEGIN NOW    And, well, ha, MICHELLE S. END
BEGIN NOW    WILL NOT BE SILENCED! HAHAHAHA!Sorry. END
BEGIN NOW   Anyway, some time ago, I reviewed Zietgiest and was so pissed that the patios seemed to be in SF rather than in the warmer climate of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   Guess what! Enter Heart and Dagger Saloon! I finally stumbled in to check this place out yesterday afternoon (they open at noon or 1 pm on the weekends) and it was a very great anti-brunch and anti-farmer's market thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW    The patrons are very talkative and approachable. END
BEGIN NOW    The staff is super friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW    They have an impressive bourbon collection and two types of sangria. END
BEGIN NOW    And, most importantly, a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW   Now if the Oakland Tamale guy would stop doing the Telegraph bars and come here instead. END
BEGIN NOW   Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    The name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW    The best thing about this bar is they have cheap drinks and they have a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm not a fan of going to bars where you can bring dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm from the super duper old school. END
BEGIN NOW    Dogs should stay their little furry butts at home. END
BEGIN NOW    As soon as i walked my fly butt out side to find a seat. END
BEGIN NOW    The most ugliest poodle walked up to me and started liking my leg. END
BEGIN NOW    This dog was going in for the kill, his nose was going further up my dress. END
BEGIN NOW    I literally started screaming and telling the dog to get the hell away from me. END
BEGIN NOW    OK i think yawl get the hint I'm not a dog lover. END
BEGIN NOW    Now don't get me wrong I like dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    Bottom line Heart and Dagger the name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW    Please don't spend to much of your life at this bar unless you rock outfits that have skull and bones on them. END
BEGIN NOW    Get my drift. END
BEGIN NOW   3 terrific pinball gamesAttack from Mars (Bally)Creature from the Black Lagoon (Bally)Arabian Nights (Williams)$3. END
BEGIN NOW   50 PBR TallboysDecent jukebox (no autotunes)Mellow people (seemed free of hipsters. END
BEGIN NOW   ). END
BEGIN NOW   I have never been treated so rudely by a bartender (and we all know how they can be sometimes, lol). END
BEGIN NOW    But imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the self-proclaimed OWNER of the place. END
BEGIN NOW    I am still just shocked by her blatant disrespect of my friends and I, I still have absolutely no idea why we were treated in this fashion-- the only cause i could speculate is that I was with mostly people of color. END
BEGIN NOW    shocking for Oakland, but i have racked my brain and that is the only thing i can come up with. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender did not want us there from the second we walked in and she made that very clear. END
BEGIN NOW    Nor did she even care when I tried to address the matter with her, happy to hear she had lost all of our business forever. END
BEGIN NOW    I see that a few other reviewers had similar experiences, how sad. END
BEGIN NOW   All's I know is that I know a LOT of bars in Oakland that at least pretend to care about their customers. END
BEGIN NOW    I will never go back to this bar, it's certainly no good to be so blatantly disrespected, but I'm certainly not going to PAY to be treated that way. END
BEGIN NOW    lol. END
BEGIN NOW   I just moved to Lakeshore from Montclair, and you know what excites me?  The fact that I can walk to a bar and stumble home late at night after. END
BEGIN NOW     You know what doesn't excite me?  The fact that Heart and Dagger Saloon of Oakland is my local bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Let's be honest, I haven't seen this many white people together in one place since Oakland's First Friday (or as I lovingly call it, "White Night"). END
BEGIN NOW     The lay out is funky . END
BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW    especially the VIP raised table right as you walk in the door. END
BEGIN NOW     The outside is nice and I will definitely try it again in the summertime, but really, I don't want to go anywhere that makes my "ethnic" friends feel uncomfortable . END

BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW   Looks like we're going to Easy. END
BEGIN NOW   Heart and Dagger is a-okay. END
BEGIN NOW    The patio is gigantic, probably more room out there than in the actual bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Prices were reasonable, but comparisons to Lucky 13 or similar bars with awesome beer selections and divey vibes are a bit uncalled for; there aren't that many beers on tap, and the crowd there (Saturday afternoon) was more likely to be reading the paper than to be chatting it up with fellow bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW    Dog friendly though!. END
BEGIN NOW   i dunno what i was expecting when i heard this was a biker dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW   maybe a little more dive and a little more hott bikers. END
BEGIN NOW   ? parking was easy, directly across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   and well, the spot itself is pretty cool inside with pool tables, pinball machines, and a jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender worked up some strong drinks and the other patrons were pretty accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW   the patio area was pretty big lined up with park benches to share, but the lighting def needs improving so us cougs could see which cubs are available to hunt! some of my biker friends rave about this spot because of it being biker friendly and maybe it just wasn't the night for them to be there. END
BEGIN NOW   so i'll be back and give it another try, maybe on a saturday. END
BEGIN NOW   check back and i'll let you know!. END
BEGIN NOW   Walked in here for the first time and was like "so THIS is what the Serenader looks like from the inside!"Great out door patio, stiff cheap drinks, good jukebox, men with facial hair . END
BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW    . END
BEGIN NOW    sign me up!. END
BEGIN NOW   Where everybody knows your name!We have been going to the Heart and Dagger since it opened, usually with me draped in my cool H and D swag. END
BEGIN NOW   This is a throwback to a great neighborhood bar, with a little punk thrown in. END
BEGIN NOW    We went last night to reintroduce our recently transplanted friends back to the amazing-ness that is the Bay Area, and ran into a group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    That is what I love about this place! Knowing that our friends all go there, and that we can catch up and hang out on the patio for hours is awesome!Boozy Suzy always makes me a delicious custom made drink when I am hanging out with all of the beer drinking boys, which puts a smile on my face every time. END
BEGIN NOW   The boys love getting Lane-Splitters for dinner, and staying and talking the night away. END
BEGIN NOW    Now, if I can only get Lane Splitters to carry gluten free pizza, I would never leave!. END
BEGIN NOW   If you are looking for a dive bar, you can't do much better than this in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    The drinks are cheap, there's a great outdoor seating area and plenty of people watching. END
BEGIN NOW    It gets a little smokey in the patio, but what do you expect from outdoor seating at a bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Pinball and Pool are also big pluses. END
BEGIN NOW   Love the fact that karaoke is not and never will be allowed!They pour great drinks with great prices and a very fun crowd to watch. END
BEGIN NOW   Check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW   I love, love love love Heart and Dagger! It's about time that Oakland got a decent rocker/biker/alternative bar!I've heard people call it a "dive bar" but it's anything but. END
BEGIN NOW    If you love Zeitgeist in SF, imagine a smaller, east bay version. END
BEGIN NOW    That's what you get at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus, you can actually go and get a few drinks and not spend more than $20. END
BEGIN NOW    The jukebox is loaded with bitchin' tunes. END
BEGIN NOW    The staff is super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    The place is Dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    And they let you bring in food from other places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW    And once in a while, Lane Splitters will bring by free pizza that's left over at the end of the night or wrong orders. END
BEGIN NOW   It's cozy and comfy. END
BEGIN NOW    All races, genders, gays, straights welcome. END
BEGIN NOW    It's nice to see a diverse alternative culture and not feel like you walked into a snobby hipster bar for once. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger has certainly become my version of "Cheers!". END
BEGIN NOW   I dig this bar, I really do. END
BEGIN NOW    The staff is friendly (even the door guys are nice) and there's usually a fun crowd inside. END
BEGIN NOW    My favorite time to visit Heart and Dagger is on a lazy Sunday when the back patio is filled with dogs, cigarettes and tall boys. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinks are reasonably priced, has every amenity you'd ever ask of a dive, and the bathrooms aren't gross! I can only speak for the Men's bathroom, though. END
BEGIN NOW    Also, if you're hungry, Lanesplitters (as well as other awesome grub) is right next to Heart and Dagger, and the bar is totally cool with you bringing a pizza box in to share with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Additional bonuses: 3 pinball tables and an ATM machine. END
BEGIN NOW    When their ATM machine isn't working, there's a bank 50 feet away. END
BEGIN NOW    The only negative: When the outside patio is closed and the bar is packed, the inside of the bar will make you claustrophobic. END
BEGIN NOW   If I've said it once, I've said it a million times:  This place is great as long as the back yard stays open. END
BEGIN NOW     When they shut it down and start hustling us in at 11 or 11:30 or whenever it is, it is just way too small to accommodate us. END
BEGIN NOW     Inevitably this results in an additional trip either back to the Kona or the Ruby Room. END
BEGIN NOW   I know they're trying to be good neighbors and I can respect that, but the early nightly closing of the outside is a total buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW   While my pals and I were wandering around Oakland on a sunny day, we came here to get a drink and sit at their outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a bit of a 30-something meat market. END
BEGIN NOW     Since we were not really out on the prowl, it was a sort of hilarious scene. END
BEGIN NOW     We drank mimosas and watched a group of British men hit on any women who'd have them. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't know about what it's like at night or when it's cold, but I found it quite enjoyable in the lovely Oakland sun. END
BEGIN NOW     Not really worth a trip to the East Bay, but good if you're already there. END
BEGIN NOW   3. END
BEGIN NOW   5 stars!It gets knocked back from 4 because the only beer I (kinda) like there is Sierra Nevada. END
BEGIN NOW     But this is a great last stop for when you don't care anymore and you just want to knock back a PBR tallboy or two. END
BEGIN NOW    Classy!   Anywaaaays, it may not be the classiest joint but it is a lot of fun -- there are little video games, a pool table, and a large outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW     The TVs play the randomest crap, and everyone there is just chillin'. END
BEGIN NOW     Gets a little crowded, but that's part of the fun. END
BEGIN NOW    And when you finally get kicked out, the Taco Guys sometimes park their truck outside, so you can grab an organic, free-range, vegetarian-fed taco (it's very important for your 2 a. END
BEGIN NOW   m. END
BEGIN NOW    drunk self to be environmentally friendly) to go with that last PBR. END
BEGIN NOW   Pitchers, pinball, patio! Great neighborhood dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    good location, average prices, dogs outside. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely plan on going back regularly. END
BEGIN NOW   This is now the bar I call my neighborhood favorite. END
BEGIN NOW     I love that it has an outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW     The one downside is that I'm a nonsmoker so if it's crowded it's hard to get away from the smokers but it's worth it to me to sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy a beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The beers are priced great, especially if you get there early enough for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     Dogs are allowed in the back which offers some entertainment if there are a few there. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders have always been very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I haven't been back in a while since the weather has been cold but the next warm, sunny day I have off work I know where I'm headed. END
BEGIN NOW   If the Lexington in SF and Zeitgeist in SF had a love child it would be Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    In recent years there has been a gaggle of gays moving over to Oakland, myself included, and we needed a gayborhoody hangout. END
BEGIN NOW    I do believe Heart and Dagger fits the bill! A group of us went to Heart and Dagger and we knew we were "home" when Gary, any dyke worth her weight knows this doorman, greeted us! There were hugs all around! He has been working the door at some infamous lesbian parties in SF for years. END
BEGIN NOW    He is an East Bay boy so he is right at home at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    The bar has that "cozy" Lex feeling and the backyard is like Zeigeist's little sister. END
BEGIN NOW    There is also a pool table indoors and it's surrounded by tons of raggedy old bar stools and a couple throne type areas to chill in. END
BEGIN NOW    Random, but welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW    Good, full bar with some attractive bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    Always a bonus! Prices were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW    And don't worry hip straighties, it is a diverse crowd and everyone seems to be welcomed with open arms. END
BEGIN NOW    We like that. END
BEGIN NOW    Diversity good. END
BEGIN NOW    Let's do the math: Cool hangout space+good bar with good prices+backyard space+Gary at the door+plenty of parking across the street = a sweet little gayborhoody spot we plan to frequent. END
BEGIN NOW   Eek!  Methinks never again. END
BEGIN NOW   Went here a few times and thought it was alright. END
BEGIN NOW     After having my bike tires slashed and the bartender refusing service saying "I don't serve blonds" to my male friend. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm done. END
BEGIN NOW   Pros:Patio out backCute dogsCons:Rude bartenderOnly one toilet. END
BEGIN NOW   which clogs and people still piss (and crap) in it until it's fullBike tires SLASHED. END
BEGIN NOW   no sign in sight saying do NOT park your bike herePeople beauregarding the jukebox with annoying musicIf you're willing to put up with idiots for bartenders, nasty toilets, and flat tires please go here!. END
BEGIN NOW   Five stars for a bar?  What caught your eye Tim?  What could possibly be that awesome:This F**&amp;ing place. END
BEGIN NOW   Pinball: Sweet. END
BEGIN NOW   Three of 'em: Even sweeterMaximum Force/ Area 51 arcade game: You mean I can get drunk and kill things ?,Pacman/Froger/Galaga/all sorts of other cool 80's hits, flashback out of the time I was in diapers. END
BEGIN NOW     RadJukebox with Iron Maiden and the Clash? And all sorts of other badass tunes? CheckCheap drinks too? I just shit myself in excitement. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe I'll go to the bathroom to cl. END
BEGIN NOW   Holy crap there's a patio too?  This place gets my vote and my dollar. END
BEGIN NOW    Its smaller than you expect but the folks tend to be friendly and loud. END
BEGIN NOW     Its a good time and theres tons of parking across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   Like my lady said: It's a dive bar, but without the urine and cigarette stench. END
BEGIN NOW     WHOA. END
BEGIN NOW   I kinda like this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Tuesday night &amp; about twenty patrons. END
BEGIN NOW   Sierra Nevada on tap for $3. END
BEGIN NOW   00(Happy hour until 7:00)Appears to be an old house @ some point in it' s past life,some new paint &amp; stucco made a large improvement. END
BEGIN NOW   Fairly neat &amp; clean. END
BEGIN NOW   Ping pong table in action in the back patio. END
BEGIN NOW   Bar tender was friendly &amp; helpful with beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW   Mixed crowd on my visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Parking was no big deal (right across the steet. END
BEGIN NOW   A big improvement from the last sh*#hole bar previously residing @ this location. END
BEGIN NOW   Patio looks to be a good spot for hot summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW   Go already!!!. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved the pinball and the backyard seating! Cash only so come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW    Great spot for a bloody mary on a Sunday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW    Bring your pooch along!. END
BEGIN NOW   When this place first opened up, I thought it was pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved the pinball, back patio &amp; the jukebox was pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW     However, over the last year I've gone there, my impression declined from "great" to "okay" to "absolutely never again will I set foot in the place". END
BEGIN NOW     The first reason I started going was for the pinball, but whatever company leases the machines to the bar (California Amusement Group?) does not keep them in good repair. END
BEGIN NOW     Since they opened, I've been there to play the machines multiple times, and each time, every single one of the 3 games were in such disrepair as to make the game almost a complete waste of money because you couldn't make key shots for scoring (like an intermittent or weak flipper, or a semi-functioning plunger). END
BEGIN NOW     Eventually, I stopped going there as often because of that, but gave it another chance a couple nights ago because my friend's friend was having a birthday party there - BIG mistake. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend (also female) and I waited at the bar to get a drink for over 20 minutes while the bartender completely ignored us, giving no eye contact &amp; no acknowledgement that she saw us, while serving everyone else at the bar, including people who had clearly come up to the bar after us. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm pretty patient when a bar is crowded, because I understand that it's not an easy job. END
BEGIN NOW     However, as we got passed over, time &amp; time again, it was obvious that the bartender just did not want to serve us. END
BEGIN NOW     WTF?  There was even some jerk standing fully behind me who leaned over my shoulder &amp; shouted - "pitcher of Trumer" - who got served while we were still waiting there!  Finally, there was guy standing next to my friend who could see what was going on (who had also come up AFTER us), and then sure as sh*t, the bartender came up to ask HIM what he wanted, so he pointed to us and said "these ladies were first", and she scoffed &amp; said something totally dismissive like "okay whatever" and then reluctantly asked what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW     After she served us, she started ignoring the guy who pointed out that we were next. END
BEGIN NOW     Okayyyyy - wow. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not sure why we got that kind of treatment, but it felt pretty crappy. END
BEGIN NOW     I sortof wondered whether it was because I was an obvious dyke. END
BEGIN NOW     I couldn't think of any other reason why we got treated that way, unless maybe the bartender just has a problem with other women in general?  (I've seen other reviews by women here who have mentioned crappy treatment by a female bartender here as well). END
BEGIN NOW     In any case, regardless of the reason, this bartender obviously did not want me &amp; my friend's business, and the owners don't care that their patrons get ripped off on their janky pinball machines either, so Mission Accomplished!!!  I will never go there again!Sad, because it had so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW   My favorite neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cozy. END
BEGIN NOW    The patrons are young, diverse, attractive, and take good care of themselves. END
BEGIN NOW    The bar staff and security are really friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice change from comparable larger venues in the City. END
BEGIN NOW    This is where I plan to bring my friends this summer. END
BEGIN NOW   The music hits all my sweet spots--blues, rockabilly, punk, HEAVY METAL. END
BEGIN NOW    The beer selection is good enough for me--and it's cheap! And if I overkill (which I almost never do anymore) I live right up the street and could crawl home if necessary. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    If grog and whiskey ain't your thing, then be sure to ask for a Suzie-kazi if Boozie Suzie is slingin shots. END
BEGIN NOW   Need something to pad the sauce so you can see straight despite beer goggles? Head over to Lanesplitter's right next door--OR DRINK SOME MORE UNTIL YOU'VE DRUNK YOURSELF SOBER. END
BEGIN NOW   I thought this place was cute. END
BEGIN NOW    The drinks were great and super cheap. END
BEGIN NOW    We went on a Friday night around 9 and it was packed. END
BEGIN NOW    I thought the outdoor space was great. END
BEGIN NOW    It had cute brick/cobble stone floor, lots of stringed lights and the cutes local puppy. END
BEGIN NOW    I will say that the layout is ridiculous, they could have fit way more tables or at least some drink holding counters. END
BEGIN NOW    i spent most the night reorganizing the space layout in my head. END
BEGIN NOW    The crowd seemed a little young, college- single types, but everyone was friendly and calm-ish. END
BEGIN NOW    However it was only 9 and the party was just beginning. END
BEGIN NOW   they have pool table and pin-ball but they were packed and unlikely to be able to play. END
BEGIN NOW   All-n-all: i would go back for a beer and hang. END
BEGIN NOW    but after we left here, we stumbled upon all that is holey in Dive Bars. END
BEGIN NOW     Smitty's Cocktails, review to follow!!. END
BEGIN NOW   Heart and Dagger is my neighborhood  bar hangout. END
BEGIN NOW    For those in the Grand Lake area, it really is convenient which adds to it's draw. END
BEGIN NOW    It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW    It has a cool motorcycle vibe and some tough looking characters that frequent. END
BEGIN NOW    While it has some diversity of character, however, it really is a hipster-ific bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Lanesplitters, the next door pizza joint, will often deliver the pizza at the end of the night. END
BEGIN NOW    GREAT outdoor patio with a fun lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW    In three words: cheap, convenient and cool. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything I want in a bar: cheap drinks, comfortable back yard to sit and drink in (complete with a huge lemon tree in the center), good jukebox, decent not-to-cool-for-school bartenders, a first person shooter video game, and a non-douchey clientele. END
BEGIN NOW   I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Can you say cheap drinks? Well, I use to pop up at this place before Heart and Dagger took over. END
BEGIN NOW    The mgmt kept changing and it wasn't always safe to go, but they had great bands. END
BEGIN NOW    It was called Serenadas. END
BEGIN NOW    Soooooooo, the bar was finally sold to someone who knows what to do. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartenders are super fast, super friendly, and always something weird, or interesting on their tv sets. END
BEGIN NOW    They have pool, playing machine, and a HUGE patio for smoking. END
BEGIN NOW    Did I already say cheap drinks?The music is a variety of rock, heavy metal, non heavy metal, and all sorts of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW     Now, hopefully your a dog lover because you might see a few dogs or cats. END
BEGIN NOW    Hard to describe the crowd, but everyone seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, for the 3rd time, cheap drinks!!!!! Oh, they occasionally give you free pizza from next door. END
BEGIN NOW   Who cars about dog, different music, or anything else if you getting served cheap fast drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    There are 4 other bars in the area if you don't like this one. END
BEGIN NOW    Right by the grand theatre, plenty of cabs, near the bus line, so no excuse for you not to go. END
BEGIN NOW    Check it out!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW   The patio is large and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Employees are nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Bouncer is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW    Pinball. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool regulars to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW    The lock on the bathroom door works (hard to find at bars). END
BEGIN NOW    Free parking in a lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   Excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW    Off the top of my head, last night I can remember hearing Faith No More, High On Fire, The Cramps, and Slayer. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender was wearing a Minor Threat shirt and they had Grindhouse playing on the TV when I walked in around 5:30. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a few doors down from Lanesplitters, who donates the delicious pizza they don't sell at the end of the night to hungry bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW   Last time hanging out on the patio, I witnessed a Blue Heron take a GIANT crap on a couple of screaming girls. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a great place. END
BEGIN NOW   Good prices, pool table, good juke, and a PATIO! A backyard patio is so rare here in Oakland, so it scores. END
BEGIN NOW   A lot of reviewers seem to have had problems with the bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW    I haven't. END
BEGIN NOW    The crowd is cool, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Good people. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd like to have a bit more room inside, and maybe a second pool table, but other than those tiny things, this place rocks. END
BEGIN NOW   This place is pretty great. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks are cheap here. END
BEGIN NOW    &amp; of course, like most of the dive bars -it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW    Luckily they have a BoA and CHASE within walking distance. END
BEGIN NOW    There's also this awesome pizza place next door to go to feed your intoxicated needs. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall a great dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW   a WHOLE lot better than the Ruby Room or Radio. END
BEGIN NOW   (I think its the same owner?). END
BEGIN NOW    The backdoor patio could use a little more lighting though and that nasty lonely blue bulb should be replaced. END
BEGIN NOW   4 stars as room for growth. END
BEGIN NOW    Great little rock and roll neighborhood bar!(too clean to call it a 'dive')They've got  a pool table, a few pinball machines and one of those table ms. pacmans. END
BEGIN NOW   Decor is cute, place is clean, and the jukebox is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm really excited about 2 things at this place:#1. END
BEGIN NOW    Tuesday nights. END
BEGIN NOW    (For DML)#2. END
BEGIN NOW    The back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    I can just imagine the awesomeness of meeting friends for booze brunches, or cooling off on balmy(ish) summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW    Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW     Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW     And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW    I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW     But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW     And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW     I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW     Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW     I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW    There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW     With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW     Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW    If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW     The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW    As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW     Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW    On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW     I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW     They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW     :(. END
BEGIN NOW    I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW      There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW     But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW    JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW     He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW    The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW     from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW     Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW    Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW     No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW      The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW    What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW     Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW     We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW      Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW     I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW     The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW     The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW     Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW    This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW     BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW     His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW     I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW     Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW     I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW     Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW      Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW    Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW    I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW      Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW     The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW    So. much. whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW     They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW     They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW    It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW     Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW     It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW     What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW     The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW     I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW     Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW    This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW      Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW      Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW    00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW    This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW    Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW     It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW     The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW     Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW    a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW     space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW     you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW    on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW    Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW     Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW     For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW     But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW     And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW     Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW     Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW     The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW     Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW     Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW     Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW    The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW     There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW     I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW      The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW      Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW    The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW    I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW      Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW    Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW      This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW      You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW    Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW    PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW      Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW    I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW    Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW    Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW    My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW      We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW    The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW      That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW    However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW     i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW      So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW    But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW    One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW      She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW      Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW      Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW    To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW      But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW     They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW     However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW    To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW      And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW    They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW     In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW     Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW    This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW     Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW     You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW     If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW     Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW     He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW     We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW     He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW     "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW     The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW     Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW     Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW    At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW     Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW     Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW    Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW      And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW    I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW    My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW    " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW       Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW      On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW      My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW      "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW    ". END
BEGIN NOW    Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW    From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW    Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW    Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW     Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW    Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW     Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW      We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW    This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW     Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW     Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW     Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW    And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW     But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW     If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW    The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW     I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW     Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW     As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW     This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW     We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW    but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW     I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW    This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW     There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW     The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW     The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW     The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW     I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW     Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW     They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW    The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW     A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW    Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW     While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW     While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW     Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW      They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW    P. END
BEGIN NOW    S. END
BEGIN NOW     I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW    Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW    great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW    I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW     So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW     Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW     I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW     I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW     It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW     We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW      They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW     We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW    Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW     The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW     Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW      From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW      They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW      By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW      Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW      Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW     My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW     Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW     5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW    Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW     Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW     And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW    I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW     But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW     And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW     I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW     Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW     I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW    There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW     With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW     Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW    If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW     The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW    As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW     Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW    On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW     I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW     They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW     :(. END
BEGIN NOW    I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW      There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW     But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW    JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW     He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW    The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW     from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW     Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW    Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW     No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW      The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW    What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW     Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW     We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW      Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW     I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW     The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW     The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW     Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW    This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW     BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW     His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW     I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW     Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW     I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW     Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW      Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW    Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW    I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW      Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW     The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW    So. END
BEGIN NOW     much. END
BEGIN NOW     whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW     They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW     They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW    It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW     Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW     It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW     What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW     The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW     I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW     Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW    This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW      Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW      Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW    00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW    This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW    Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW     It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW     The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW     Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW    a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW     space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW     you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW    on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW    Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW     Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW     For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW     But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW     And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW     Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW     Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW     The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW     Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW     Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW     Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW    The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW     There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW     I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW      The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW      Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW    The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW    I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW      Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW    Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW      This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW      You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW    Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW    PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW      Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW    I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW    Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW    Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW    My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW      We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW    The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW      That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW    However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW     i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW      So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW    But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW    One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW      She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW      Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW      Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW    To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW      But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW     They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW     However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW    To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW      And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW    They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW     In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW     Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW    This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW     Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW     You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW     If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW     Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW     He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW     We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW     He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW     "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW     The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW     Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW     Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW    At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW     Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW     Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW    Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW      And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW    I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW    My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW    " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW       Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW      On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW      My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW      "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW    ". END
BEGIN NOW    Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW    From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW    Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW    Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW     Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW    Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW     Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW      We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW    This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW     Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW     Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW     Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW    And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW     But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW     If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW    The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW     I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW     Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW     As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW     This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW     We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW    but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW     I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW    This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW     There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW     The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW     The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW     The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW     I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW     Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW     They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW    The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW     A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW    Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW     While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW     While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW     Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW      They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW    P. END
BEGIN NOW    S. END
BEGIN NOW     I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW    Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW    great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW    I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW     So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW     Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW     I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW     I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW     It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW     We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW      They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW     We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW    Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW     The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW     Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW      From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW      They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW      By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW      Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW      Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW     My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW     Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW     5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW    Great dive bar with outdoor seating area - which is not a common thing in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     Simple, straightforward drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     As with all dive bars, the bathrooms are not that clean, but you know, deal with it. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, there was a not-totally-stable seeming lady who was yelling at women in the restroom to get out of the toilet faster. END
BEGIN NOW     The outdoor seating area is really nice with some full trees for shade during the afternoons. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, they seem cool with letting you bring in outside food and there is a cuban place, pizza place and burger place adjacent to the H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    I would give this place zero stars and the Abusive Bartender badge if I could, after witnessing some rather horrific and disturbing behavior from a male bartender on a female customer that was 100% unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW      Been going here for years, but after seeing that, never going back again. END
BEGIN NOW      Scary. END
BEGIN NOW    Don't go to this bar unless you wish to be attacked by a bartender. END
BEGIN NOW     One of the bartenders first ignored me, then when I asked for a beer, started screaming profanities at me and then actually put his hands on me and started pushing me around. END
BEGIN NOW     I can only imagine that if I had resisted him shoving me around, he would've quickly escalated to striking me, since none of this was provoked in any way. END
BEGIN NOW     I will never go back there again, even though I've been going there since they opened. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends are all boycotting this place because of this asshole, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Once a biker bar, now more hipster but the drinks are decent and the prices very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Only downside is everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh. END
BEGIN NOW     and cash only (although they have an atm)!. END
BEGIN NOW    The majority of the people at this bar have been nothing but gracious and courteous to me. END
BEGIN NOW     They've allowed me to bring in my dog, and it has been fine. END
BEGIN NOW     Tonight, a bartender on duty, someone that I had met on other visits, was in rare form. END
BEGIN NOW     He was discourteous. END
BEGIN NOW     He was argumentative. END
BEGIN NOW     He was mean. END
BEGIN NOW     I think he was belligerently drunk. END
BEGIN NOW     I have been a bartender and have managed bars and restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW     You can check my yelp history and how often I have written Yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     Almost never. END
BEGIN NOW     If interested, you can ask me which restaurants or bars I've managed. END
BEGIN NOW     This sucked writing down one of my own, and I've never written a negative review of another bar before. END
BEGIN NOW     It was simply the most offensively I've ever been treated in any bar or restaurant, ever, before or after working in the industry. END
BEGIN NOW    I stopped by for the Prince tribute last week. END
BEGIN NOW      Got there fairly early, just before 5pm. END
BEGIN NOW     The CASH ONLY sign at the bar was an unpleasant surprise, and the ATM in the bar is one of those I just don't trust. END
BEGIN NOW     Its connection seemed spotty too, as a number of people had issues with errors all in a row. END
BEGIN NOW      I ended up borrowing cash from a friend rather than risk it. END
BEGIN NOW     Decent crowd; not packed and not empty. END
BEGIN NOW      The backyard was actually the fuller part because the weather was nice. END
BEGIN NOW      My friends and I tried a couple of the drink specials which were Prince themed (either raspberry or purple, it seemed). END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing too incredible, but we enjoyed them nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a dive bar, not a cocktail lounge. END
BEGIN NOW      If you approach with that spirit, you'll have fun. END
BEGIN NOW    CASH ONLY (only downside, besides the parking meters which are ridiculously expensive). END
BEGIN NOW     $17 pitcher of Racer 5. END
BEGIN NOW     Great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll be back next time I'm in the area. END
BEGIN NOW    Two words: dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Personally, I'm a fan of the idea of dive bars. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean, who doesn't love cheap drinks? I know that I do. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially living in the Bay Area, anything that can keep some money in my pockets makes me pretty happy. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash. END
BEGIN NOW     Only. END
BEGIN NOW     Ouch. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not someone who carries cash. END
BEGIN NOW     That makes it so I drink less at places like this. END
BEGIN NOW     It also has limited space inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I tend to run cool, so I like to be inside which can be rough when it's busy. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a pool table which is frequently occupied. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm no pool shark but I enjoy putting my terrible physics and geometry skills to use. END
BEGIN NOW    especially under the influence. END
BEGIN NOW     It's always a good idea. END
BEGIN NOW    So three stars. END
BEGIN NOW     It's close and easy to get to but nothing super fancy or spectacular, over the top service. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a dive bar so yeah. END
BEGIN NOW    expect that. END
BEGIN NOW    Dive bars are more my style. END
BEGIN NOW      This spot has some real charm. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome outdoor patio and smoking lounge. END
BEGIN NOW     All sorts of characters, friendly fast bartenders, cool decor, and just that nice fun weirdo vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only!. END
BEGIN NOW    like yelp said "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW    I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    " I just don't feel safe or welcomed going into that place I will say the redeeming factor are the cute dogs just hanging out around their owners. END
BEGIN NOW    Jumped to my Top 5 favorite Bars I've ever been to. END
BEGIN NOW    Punk Bar with Pinball and great outside seating! Hell yeah! Service was good, prices were fair, and jukebox selection was On Point!. END
BEGIN NOW    This place seemed a little too much for my style when I first saw it from the outside (as it looks like your average hard core dive bar, often with motorcycle groups hanging around out front). END
BEGIN NOW     However I found it actually quite nice once I ventured inside. END
BEGIN NOW     The area I like best is the back patio, which has a nice beer garden feel. END
BEGIN NOW     I came here during the day but j can imagine it being a very poppin' place at night--it seems like a fun place to have drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Will come back again at night. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool place with a typical dive-bar vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only so be prepared - I almost wasn't! Outside was probably my favorite - a fair amount of seating, and they allow dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     The problem is that most dogs have owners, and some of those owners haven't trained their dog how to interact with other dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    Good drinks, bottled beer is probably the best bet. END
BEGIN NOW    it would be better with music at the Patio. END
BEGIN NOW    And gentrification is complete. END
BEGIN NOW      What used to be a laid back blues spot is now patronized by Hells Angels, never thought I  would see that at Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW      Gentrification : game, set, match. END
BEGIN NOW    It's good straight to the point bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I like to drink and they like to pour them, for a fee, of coarse. END
BEGIN NOW     It's my regular waterhole for the past 5 yrs or so. END
BEGIN NOW     They let you bring in outside food and it's one of the few places around that has a private patio to enjoy the nice weather and friends when the time calls for it. END
BEGIN NOW    Note: Be sure to hit an ATM because it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW    I love Heart and Dagger, yep it is a bar, but it is also the super sweet spot to shoot pool by my house, plus you can bring in your own food. END
BEGIN NOW    awesome! I came to the stairs in the front of the establishment and I looked up at them thinking, "Wow, how am I going to do this with one foot?"  The bouncer, Gary, was really cool, he helped get me up there so I could have fun inside with all the other bipeds. END
BEGIN NOW    lol. END
BEGIN NOW    There is always such a cool crowd at this place, no matter what you like. END
BEGIN NOW      The juke box offers some really great songs, the kind of songs that remind you of moments in your life that seemingly make you smile. END
BEGIN NOW      I think last night I heard an old "Wham" song that lifted my mood. END
BEGIN NOW     We watched a ton of Raider fans playing pool and basking in the glory of their win last night at the Battle of the Bay. END
BEGIN NOW      While the football game put my friend in a bad mood, the Raider fans were happy---let them have this little moment, it is not very often it happens ;)We attempted to go out to the patio in the back, and the ramp down into that area was yet another challenge for my one footed self. END
BEGIN NOW      But none to worry, there was a guy working at that back area too who helped me get around. END
BEGIN NOW      I have visited this spot for several years and have always had a memorable time--whether those memories be awesome, weird, annoying, ridiculous or fun, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    I always leave with a memory. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart and Dagger is always on the crawl list for birthdays, and pretty much the "stand by" for any night. END
BEGIN NOW      We can play pool or pinball, listen to music, watch pretty disturbing movies on the TV, hang out in the patio, or just sit inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I am sure to run into friends from the neighborhood at any drop in, so that is always cool when I am out solo. END
BEGIN NOW      Stephani Smiles for HND ;). END
BEGIN NOW    Great place to have a beer and chill. END
BEGIN NOW     The outdoor patio is fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd give it 5 stars, but occasionally the clientele can get a little. END
BEGIN NOW     roudy. END
BEGIN NOW     And not in a good way. END
BEGIN NOW    The un-dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to like this place, but the clientele is all highbrow now. END
BEGIN NOW     I never liked that it was cash only, but I still love the jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW     The last time I was there the skinny bearded doorman kept shouting across the bar to the bartender which was super annoying. END
BEGIN NOW     I was unimpressed with his need for attention. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe early in the day this place is better but when it's crowded, nah. END
BEGIN NOW     I was particularly amused by the weather-denying girl in the tank top showing off her tattoos as everyone else in the bar was in a coat and scarf because it was freezing outside and they had all of the doors open. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe in 1992 that would be impressive, but in 2016 you are one of many. END
BEGIN NOW     Put your coat on, sweety. END
BEGIN NOW     You'll catch your death. END
BEGIN NOW    Terrible bar with terrible staff. END
BEGIN NOW     Rude door people causing fights with new patrons, and that was before anyone had a chance to order a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     Not sure how a business with such terrible customer service stays in business. END
BEGIN NOW     I wouldn't come back here again if you paid me!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Let me just say, I've been here only a handful of times. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't come here enough. END
BEGIN NOW    It reminds me of some of my favorite dives when I lived in the City, just wish I lived within walking distance ;)Great roadhouse atmosphere inside, and a chill backyard area. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome place to come any day of week. END
BEGIN NOW     They pool tables and arcade games. END
BEGIN NOW     Cold beer on tab and bottled with a place to drink outside. END
BEGIN NOW     Mediocre pricing but they aren't shy on their pours. END
BEGIN NOW    This is my go to dive bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Super chill vibe, mostly locals, and cool kids. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a pool table, juke box and tables outside where you can bring the dogs, pizza and a board game. END
BEGIN NOW    what's not to like??Drinks are decent enough, I recommend sticking to beer, racer 5 on tap. END
BEGIN NOW    people seem to like the bloody Mary's and mimosa are perfect pre or post brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here late at night and have had a completely different experience than now. END
BEGIN NOW     Today, we arrived at the bar closer to sunset and hung out on the patio with my $3 beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance and other patrons were really mellow and enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cheap, so that is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender, however, seemed to enjoy taking out her life's disappointments on the customers. END
BEGIN NOW     I would've rather served myself. END
BEGIN NOW     It won't keep me from returning, just yet. END
BEGIN NOW    My favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     They play great rock and roll inside, and the beer garden is a fantastic place to spend an afternoon, or play cards late into the night. END
BEGIN NOW     There's tons of food in the neighborhood that you can bring in, and they're dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     The pool scene is competitive and the table is better than average for a 'dive' bar (which the Dagger barely qualifies as). END
BEGIN NOW     There's a great mix of people from East Bay Rats to local yuppies to SF expat hipsters and everyone gets along. END
BEGIN NOW     It gets crowded but not too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW    Just don't sit at the end of the bar by the men's bathroom -- you'll only smell urinal cakes all night. END
BEGIN NOW     Unless you're into that I guess. END
BEGIN NOW    All hail the Duke! It was by the gracious invitation of His Majesty himself that the girlfriend &amp; I came to Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     &amp; what a lovely Dukedom it is. END
BEGIN NOW    The Heart &amp; Dagger is sort of a dive bar, sort of. END
BEGIN NOW     It's too well-lit inside to really be a total dive. END
BEGIN NOW     It's divey in a hipster-ish kind of way. END
BEGIN NOW     But the hipster to real people ratio isn't too high, so it's still cool. END
BEGIN NOW    Full bar, impressive booze selection, nice cocktails, decent brews on tap, great Happy Hour deals, pinball/ video games &amp; pool table inside, dog-friendly patio out back, &amp; motorcycle parking right in front off the street. END
BEGIN NOW     It's all good. END
BEGIN NOW    We had a chill time time sipping a few drinks (but only a few, it's cash only here, I had loads of plastic but not a whole lotta green on me) &amp; watching Markus' reign of terror on the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW     Until, at last, he was narrowly defeated by a very pretty young lady. END
BEGIN NOW     Who says chivalry is dead?Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     I like it. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll have to return as often as possible to see the Duke, his fair Dukedom &amp; any other shenanigans afoot. END
BEGIN NOW    Made my way over to oakland to meet up some friends at this sweet lil spot. END
BEGIN NOW     Surrounded by plenty of parking and food it was a nice change up from SF. END
BEGIN NOW     It is a cash only bar some come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW     Full bar with some good beer on tap, and one dude holding down the fort on a saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     ( he was wicked fast). END
BEGIN NOW     Outside is a sweet lil patio for a awesome place to relax and chat( bench seating) and the fresh air was great. END
BEGIN NOW     The prices for drinks were right on, and no overly pricey with some good pours. END
BEGIN NOW    Cheap drinks, outdoor space, punk rock music -- YES. END
BEGIN NOW    You can smoke. END
BEGIN NOW     Here. END
BEGIN NOW     And drink. END
BEGIN NOW     A nice well whisky and a good pour. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     They check ID very professionally. END
BEGIN NOW     The people who work there are people, not hipster asshats or attitudinal testosteronies. END
BEGIN NOW     i like it, if you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW     Ahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW    I can see this place is going to be my favorite bar in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW    -Great bartender, totally personable and cool. END
BEGIN NOW    -Cool door guy, huge laugh!-Great patio, the likes of which are hard to find around here. END
BEGIN NOW    -Giant Lemons. END
BEGIN NOW    -Good mix of all types at the bar, everyone in a good mood. END
BEGIN NOW    -Drinks were reasonably priced and poured strong. END
BEGIN NOW    -It' close to my house. END
BEGIN NOW    Basically everything needed in a bar that's going to be seeing a lot of this face. END
BEGIN NOW    This place definitely has the dive bar feel to it. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm sure this is a good local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW      What really appeals to me about this places is the outside area in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      There are plenty of tables to sit at. END
BEGIN NOW      Great place to go with some friends to relax with a beer and chat. END
BEGIN NOW       Although it does get busy and filled up so no guarantee you will get a table. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a casual grungy type scene so jeans and causal attire is the standard. END
BEGIN NOW      I like the location and the vibe here though--super chill and relaxed. END
BEGIN NOW      There are a couple pool tables inside as well inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd definitely go back for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW    "Oh, he's very popular Ed. END
BEGIN NOW     The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. END
BEGIN NOW     They think he's a righteous dude. END
BEGIN NOW    "-- from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"A visit to Heart &amp; Dagger often reminds me of these words. END
BEGIN NOW     As watering holes go, it may not be for every body, but it has a strikingly wide array of fans. END
BEGIN NOW     And for us fans, it holds a piece of our hearts. END
BEGIN NOW     The vibe is casual (read: 'divey'), distinctly Oakland, with a wild undercurrent befitting a David Lynch film. END
BEGIN NOW     A biker bar only 'modestly' gentrified by neo-Oaklandites/wannabees/over-incomed geeks, to which I confess a partial complicity. END
BEGIN NOW      The playground segments into roughly three arenas:  (1) Bar area, where the bees get their honey -- and the barkeeps, both efficient and commanding, do a great job keeping the drones and workers happy. END
BEGIN NOW     Beer specials and shots of liquor are an excellent value, especially during HH, when my lovely Bulliet Manhattans are especially generous. END
BEGIN NOW     (2) Patio, definitely favored by the dog-partnered and smoking clientele, and seems to collect the more regular patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Gossip is overheard, smiles are witnessed, wafting cigarette smoke is inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW     Water from two giant ThermosTM coolers is free and easily accessed for both two and four-legged visitors back here. END
BEGIN NOW    And then there is (3), the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW      Where I learned, thanks to tutelage from billiards Maestro M and a few tips from other regulars, to now actually almost *not* suck at pool-playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Back to (3) in a bit. END
BEGIN NOW     For the bar en masse though: at its heart of gold though does push the tip of its dagger, as visits here have not always been a feel-good utopian experience. END
BEGIN NOW     I've seen people verbally insulted or kicked out for debatable reasons by the staff (actually mostly just one staff member, whose shifts are minimal); heard obnoxious comments by drunk and/or loud bigots; spied sketchy characters sporting knives in their back pocket, and witnessed a few "lively" disagreements over 8-ball. END
BEGIN NOW     Admittedly, H&amp;D is an onion with many layers, and not all those layers are pretty. END
BEGIN NOW      The trifling edginess is in reality as much an allure as a downer, and a metaphor and microcosm of our world and city and a reminder that good or bad you're still a part of it so why not be a positive part or at the very least learn how to deal with it? In reality, I don't wax all philosophic like that when I visit here. END
BEGIN NOW     Which brings us back to (3):  I do, truly, enjoy the regular pool players, and the competition and camaraderie I'm fortunate to have shared. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm a square peg for several reasons in H&amp;D, but the bonding with other such pegs or non-pegs is the reason I love to visit. END
BEGIN NOW     And on those visits, I get to practice my shot, nurse my bourbon, and inhale the simple sideways joys that life has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW    Can one sum up H&amp;D in a single catchphrase?  "All for one, one for all, just watch your wallet and drink. END
BEGIN NOW    " "You don't have to be a biker to come, but it don't hurt if you are one. END
BEGIN NOW    " "A bar of inimitable substance and a multitude of substances. END
BEGIN NOW    " Nah . END
BEGIN NOW     screw that. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger defies an easy Yelp review description. END
BEGIN NOW     And I'm guessing they like it that way. END
BEGIN NOW     Just be chill, be respectful, be unorthodox, be free, and be yourself. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not to be analyzed. END
BEGIN NOW     Just enjoyed. END
BEGIN NOW    If you like dive bars without the meth mouth, Sons of Anarchy watching patrons, Heart and Dagger will sit very well with you. END
BEGIN NOW     (It's kind of not really even a dive bar, shh)They *are* cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     There is an ATM with a $2. END
BEGIN NOW    25 fee, but you get that back fast because their drinks are so stinkin' cheap-- and strong!There is a pool table room and (the best part), an amazing outdoor patio that is friendly to your cigarette smoking buds. END
BEGIN NOW     It's kind of the perfect place to be on a summer night. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart &amp; Dagger is a solid go-to bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Come here once &amp; you'll likely become a regular. END
BEGIN NOW    one of my favorite places! cheap drinks, good people, a big back patio that is open late. END
BEGIN NOW     Home made beef jerky, aweful/good movies playing and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     also hosted by some of the best bartenders/doormen you'll meet. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, almost forgot. END
BEGIN NOW     they have three pinball machines (including walking dead) and a decent pooltable with a good/honest rotation of players. END
BEGIN NOW    Love heart and dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     My go to spot when I need a very laid back, wind down, kind of day. END
BEGIN NOW    I drink too much. END
BEGIN NOW      I came to that realization, drunk, during a disappointing pizza experience (why the fuck my bf drove us all the way to oakland for pizza who knows?)   What to do at 11pm on weeknight, drunk, concerned about how you will pay for Betty Ford and in Oakland?Heart and Dagger saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    Sure, my boyfriend tells me he loves pizza more than me. END
BEGIN NOW     Get me drink. END
BEGIN NOW    Thank the Lord in Heaven he volunteered to DD. END
BEGIN NOW    As Kevin B. END
BEGIN NOW     mentioned, if the Zeitgeist is too far of a hoof to get to, then H and D will do. END
BEGIN NOW      The back yard is pretty big and decked with communal tables for both large and small group outings. END
BEGIN NOW      We arrived armed with IDs out (although no one, but NO ONE in my party looked even remotely underage) and was met with friendly banter from the door man no. END
BEGIN NOW     1. END
BEGIN NOW      At one point I couldn't find my friends--not like the place is really that big, so I blame jet-lag for my confusion--and went back out onto the street to look for them. END
BEGIN NOW      Door man no. END
BEGIN NOW     2 had all the charm of a TSA agent upon my re-entry not 2 minutes later. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe he thought I was some a-hole ABC cop trying to pull a fast one on him?  I wish the US could just lighten up a bit on ID checking, but I get why they can't. END
BEGIN NOW      Anyway, this place is an interesting replacement for The Serenader, if, however, not in keeping with the vibe of that which existed for decades in this very spot. END
BEGIN NOW      -a place where bitchin' BBQ reigned in the backyard and my white face was a minority. END
BEGIN NOW    Great dive bar to drink at on a hot summer afternoon - The big back patio is usually bustling, but not too crowded to get a seat at a table (usually). END
BEGIN NOW      Good beer selection, good service, good prices. END
BEGIN NOW      Ive seen people set up picnics on the patio tables so it's pretty cool that they let you do that. END
BEGIN NOW     Great place to hang out. END
BEGIN NOW    Me likes. END
BEGIN NOW      Outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone has a dog. END
BEGIN NOW      Clean restrooms. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW      Good music. END
BEGIN NOW      Pool table and PIN BALL!  Don't try to bring chicken wings from Hot wings with bones. END
BEGIN NOW      Wilkie will not let you in. END
BEGIN NOW      The dogs are very important. END
BEGIN NOW    I was Chilling at the Slab when I get a Text from my Yelp Minister of Fun John Z to join the Posse at H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     So I jumped into my Whip Black Beauty and rolled to Oak town . END
BEGIN NOW     I grabbed a parking spot right across the street. END
BEGIN NOW      Tip 1 no parking lot just street parking. END
BEGIN NOW    So I roll in and see John Z and Markus dominating the Pool Table. END
BEGIN NOW     Anne Marie shooting Deer in the Arcade. END
BEGIN NOW     Home Sweet Home. END
BEGIN NOW     Yelp Posse in full effect. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice Big Bar ,Friendly Bartenders ,LCD TVs for Entertainment and a Cool Back Patio for Summer Nights or Days. END
BEGIN NOW    A wide selection of Beers and a cool retro Juke box adds to the Charm of H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    Great meeting Spot or a Friendly game of Pool H&amp;D is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW    Tip 2 They allow outside food in. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     2$ canned beer and really nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are looking to meet up with a group of friends this place has a really big patio with plenty of space. END
BEGIN NOW     Also it is cash only, so be ready for that. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved coming here and will be back. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a neat, inexpensive, kind of gnarly bar in downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely worth popping in! Don't mind the aggressive music and cool/weird stuff on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW    Value for Money: 4 StarsCustomer Service: 4 StarsAmbience: 2 Stars (markdown for hipsters!)Location: 4 Stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger Saloon appeals to my mysterious and cheap side. END
BEGIN NOW     everyday prices are cheap, HH is a bit cheaper. END
BEGIN NOW    lots of entertainment options: pool table, pinball machines, video machines, juke box, flat screens. END
BEGIN NOW     drink: gin &amp; tonic(4)-pretty strongguinness black lager(4)just so-soon draught:-happy hours(m-f, 4-7), $3 drafts, 3. END
BEGIN NOW    5 wells -voted by bar 2011,  east bay express-voted best jukebox in bar 2011, east bay express-patio seating in rear-free parking under freeway after 6. END
BEGIN NOW    -fast. END
BEGIN NOW     smiling service-prepared to be carded-pizza, burger, wing food options nearby. END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    -many patrons wear leather and tats. END
BEGIN NOW     clientele on the edge of heavy metal. END
BEGIN NOW    This bar has a genuine rock 'n' roll atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    Ah such a gem. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend took me here to play pool about a month ago and now I go about once a week. END
BEGIN NOW     There is usually rock music playing and something weird on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW     However, If there is a game on then it will be on the TVs. END
BEGIN NOW     They have pool and a couple of arcade games like pinball and buck hunter. END
BEGIN NOW     They have an awesome outside patio with a bunch of picnic tables. END
BEGIN NOW      You can take drinks outside and people can smoke out there too. END
BEGIN NOW    You can bring your dog! There are usually at least two dogs in the place which is so awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM. END
BEGIN NOW    No food, but there are food places next door and you can bring food in. END
BEGIN NOW     Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW    Well, my Yelp buddy Max has been going here for a while, and given that it's a six-minute walk from my house, I really have no excuse for not getting here sooner. END
BEGIN NOW     Anyway, I've seen the light! This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Pool tables are so rare here in NorCal! And a patio!And this place is right next to the parking are under the 580!. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent prices, nice patio when it's warm outside. END
BEGIN NOW    They allow dogs which is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW    Good spot to hang low. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    My head hurts, and it has nothing to do with what I drank last night. END
BEGIN NOW      Water; I should start learning to drink more water. END
BEGIN NOW      But what's a poor girl to do when a bar insists on serving her most favourite whiskey at such amazing prices??Heart &amp; Dagger - For years, I'd walked by this place too afraid of my own shadow to venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW      Then one day, I came across a photo someone took of the outside and discovered that they kicked it up a few dozen notches on their curbside appeal. END
BEGIN NOW      Then, The C. END
BEGIN NOW     made me meet him here before showtime. END
BEGIN NOW      Who knew that it would become a small trend?I now can proudly say that I overcame my misguided fears and have found a sweet little spot on the ever changing face of Lakeshore Ave to call home. END
BEGIN NOW      This bar is perfect in its divey-ness, has a huge patio for perfect summer evenings, a nice little pool table that only costs $1 a game, and has an awesome jukebox that plays Flogging Molly and David Bowie!  Plus, the prices on the drinks are super inexpensive, and the bartenders are more than kindly souls that'll make you think of Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW    You, too, should overcome your fears and check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW      I feel myself lucky to have been introduced. END
BEGIN NOW    Always fun. END
BEGIN NOW    dive bar with a great crowd!!! Cash only FYI. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog friendly which is cool and outside private patio. END
BEGIN NOW    great place!!!. END
BEGIN NOW    This establishment is hateful. END
BEGIN NOW     I have never been treated so rudely. END
BEGIN NOW     I bought one drink and tried to take a picture on my 21st birthday and the customers and employees were malicious in a creepy way. END
BEGIN NOW     There was no wrong doing on my part, and yet my friend and I were assaulted by the bouncer and he tried to kick my friend. END
BEGIN NOW     All we wanted to do was take a picture which we were told was okay, but the customers sitting around the mural were egotistical. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead of the bouncer helping us get a picture he told us to take, he was on the side of the rude customer. END
BEGIN NOW     We just wanted to have a good time but that's obviously not possible there. END
BEGIN NOW     They were nothing but a bunch of creepy douche bags. END
BEGIN NOW     Good luck at this bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I would give this place 0 stars, if I could. END
BEGIN NOW    When Zeitgeist is just too far away. END
BEGIN NOW    The Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon wins on the name alone, but on a sunny day after a picnic on Lake Merritt, it's a great place to relax with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Like Zeitgeist across the bay, it's got a biker motif and strong beer on tap, along with a popular backyard for catching up with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     This place also has pool tables and a well-stocked jukebox (also like Zeitgeist), so it's better designed for long stays instead of a quick drink, and the crowd gets friendlier as the afternoon goes on. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're having a thirsty afternoon in the East Bay, quench here. END
BEGIN NOW    Sooo ran to Heart and Dagger for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     After a long day. END
BEGIN NOW     Stood there while the ex zz top member bartender serves about 5 people that came in after I did. END
BEGIN NOW     he finally notices my 6'5 dude . END
BEGIN NOW     And I "wave" to motion "over here" . END
BEGIN NOW     Since I'm paying. END
BEGIN NOW    He emulates my wave . END
BEGIN NOW    extra dramatic then begins to reprimand me tell me to never wave at him again or he will just ignore me . END
BEGIN NOW     I said well I just waved cause you asked the guy I'm with what he wanted and I'm buying sooo. END
BEGIN NOW    He said NO SERIOUSLY I DONT CARE. END
BEGIN NOW    I wish I had a drink in my hand so I could throw it on him. END
BEGIN NOW    FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW     And especially THAT BARTENDER . END
BEGIN NOW    I miss places where black people were allowed and treated with the same respect as the transplants . END
BEGIN NOW    He felt completely justified coming at the ONLY black couple in the bar like that. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe I'm sensitive but really FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW     May it burn to the ground and be resurrected as the serenader again . END
BEGIN NOW    One word for this establishment. END
BEGIN NOW     RACIST. END
BEGIN NOW     We are professional, well educated, LATINO couple in our 40's, born &amp; raised in SF and have lived in Lake Merritt for 10 years. END
BEGIN NOW     We decided to have a beer on a Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     The tattooed, black haired female bartender took our orders, delivered our beers. END
BEGIN NOW    then THREW OUR CHANGE at us, for no apparent reason. END
BEGIN NOW     Then the heavy set tattooed bartender says KICK ROCKS. END
BEGIN NOW     For those of you who are not familiar with this term. END
BEGIN NOW     Urban Dictionary definition: F*** OFF or GET OUTTA HERE. END
BEGIN NOW     Shocked and utterly disgusted people like this exist in OAKLAND? REALLY? Thought we were imaging this, but Nope. END
BEGIN NOW     Just read all the HIDDEN reviews, exactly the same. END
BEGIN NOW     Bottom line. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're brown or black. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW     THIS ESTABLISHMENT TREATS MINORITIES LIKE GARBAGE. END
BEGIN NOW    Still the most awesomest bar in town!Don't go with attitude and you won't get none, epic back patio and cheap drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     Better like friendly dogs, if not don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a super dog lovin' joint, if you fear them stay away and don't complain about them being there. END
BEGIN NOW    consider yourself warned. END
BEGIN NOW    Props to Suzy, Allison and Eric. END
BEGIN NOW    damn the whole crew over there makes my day. END
BEGIN NOW     Just pour me a strong drink, talk like a dirty sailor and I'm yours!A Quality, respectful stand up business. END
BEGIN NOW    all haters can walk the plank!!!xoxo!. END
BEGIN NOW    Great bar to play pool and just meet new people. END
BEGIN NOW     Very pet friendly and easy going great jukebox music and a spacious outdoor seating area. END
BEGIN NOW    pretty hipster bar a great improvement from the old bar it use to be. END
BEGIN NOW    She suggested we meet at this bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     I heard about it before and without context imagined it to be a seedy dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I arrived first and sat at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender was nice, the drinks were very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     My beer wasn't as cold as I would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd was definitely a varied mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW     I walked around, and checked out the back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Then decided, this is cool place. END
BEGIN NOW     My date showed up we had a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender randomly brought us a couple of free drinks to taste. END
BEGIN NOW     One thing led to another and we left together. END
BEGIN NOW     (It must have been the Funky Cold Medina)I would definitely like to come back and recommend this bar. END
BEGIN NOW    This is the only bar I like in my hood the bartenders actually remember who you are and always treat you friendly regardless of how busy they are. END
BEGIN NOW     The mixed drinks are always good and the beers is always nice and cold. END
BEGIN NOW      I always love when summer is around because it's fun to see what the guest keg will be. END
BEGIN NOW     The music is always great and the movies they play on the background are always entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice vibe and cool place to grab a beer and play a few games on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a giant outdoor patio with tons of tables in the back and lots of arcade games and a pool table inside. END
BEGIN NOW     It was kind of crowded when we went, so it took a while to find a seat and we didn't end up staying long enough to play pool but I would be down to come back and play a few rounds. END
BEGIN NOW    Enjoy being able to sit out back and enjoy the beers. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly staff is always a plus. END
BEGIN NOW    Soft opening tonight. END
BEGIN NOW      Big Daddy on draft. END
BEGIN NOW      Free Lanesplitter pizza. END
BEGIN NOW      Great friends and deep conversation. END
BEGIN NOW      If I didn't have a 10 month at home, I might find myself here MUCH more often. END
BEGIN NOW      Wish you were there Ben. END
BEGIN NOW     :(On the way out I saw local newsletter wordsmith Ken Katz. END
BEGIN NOW      He was enjoying a Negra Modelo and surveying the territory. END
BEGIN NOW      He asked me what I thought and said he looked forward to my Yelp review. END
BEGIN NOW      This one is for you Ken!  Keep up the good confabulation. END
BEGIN NOW      See you in the hood. END
BEGIN NOW    If you like Lucky 13 or Lost Weekend in Alameda, you will love Heart and Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW      Check 'er out!. END
BEGIN NOW    One star for every sip of beer before my dog and I got booted. END
BEGIN NOW    She was barking at another dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Which I get is annoying and cause for concern. END
BEGIN NOW     But she was only barking because she was leashed, and wanted to go greet the other dog. END
BEGIN NOW     And she was only leashed because within a minute of walking in I was told I had to leash her. END
BEGIN NOW     Which would have been fine and fair except that no other dogs were leashed. END
BEGIN NOW     Which puts my girl in a weird situation where everyone else is meeting and greeting and she's tied down in a corner. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence the barking. END
BEGIN NOW     I kind of wanted to point all this out at the time, but it's been my experience that nothing good comes from arguing with bouncers, so we left. END
BEGIN NOW     Which sucks! For the 3 minutes we were there it seemed like a cool little dive. END
BEGIN NOW     We live around the corner, and I was hoping this could be our end up after walks around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been there a few times and now I live a few blocks behind it so I'll be there a few times more. END
BEGIN NOW    Trumer and a burger from next door. END
BEGIN NOW    Kwik Way is theshit andthis place is lucky to be next door. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a fine bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Decent. END
BEGIN NOW    Dog central park today in the back. END
BEGIN NOW    But I got a burger and a beer,so nocomplaints. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is cool if you are a trite, predictable cliché of a hipster / fauxpunk. END
BEGIN NOW     If you like waiting 20 minutes for mediocre service and a can of PBR at 500% mark-up, please come on down to Heart and Dagger!Idiots are more than welcome to enjoy pretending at rebellion while leaning on broken, unusable pin ball machines. END
BEGIN NOW    Don't forget that we offer a special discount if you are one of those girls with no particular talent and so you take your clothing off on stage assuming that means you're a burlesque dancer. END
BEGIN NOW     Please hold your next "desperate for mom's attention" meeting here and get a free pitcher of horse piss! I mean Tecate!. END
BEGIN NOW    I used to like this place!  What the crap happened?  The bartender wasn't just rude, it was some whole other level of maximum hatred!  Did she think I was someone else?  Someone who had stolen her husband, killed her dog, and burned down her house?  Because that's what it felt like. END
BEGIN NOW      Damn. END
BEGIN NOW    After eventually getting a beer, we head over to play the pinball machines and they are in such a sorry state as to basically be a total ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart and Dagger, I can take a hint. END
BEGIN NOW      You don't want me to come there and spend my money, so I shant. END
BEGIN NOW    Okay, I admit I was only in here for 15 minutes, meeting friends before seeing a movie at the Grand Lake Theatre. END
BEGIN NOW      However, for a dive bar it's not really divey at all. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, it's dark and has pool tables. END
BEGIN NOW     But everyone is really nice and the place is clean and not skeazy. END
BEGIN NOW     Not only that but there's a great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     There's lots of bike parking out front and they don't mind if you lock up onto the railing either. END
BEGIN NOW     The bouncer didn't give me any grief about running in then out, parking my bike right next to the front door (I asked if it was okay) and then leaving again without actually getting a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely recommended as a nice neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks are inexpensive and stiff . END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only is a  bit irritating. END
BEGIN NOW    Only one toilet Plenty of seating outside . END
BEGIN NOW    I felt comfortable here and I think that it was because everyone was so friendly and engaging. END
BEGIN NOW     I should remember to visit that side of the lake for a more often especially if I'm in the mood for mustaches, boys who ride bikes , tattoos and a slick comb over, oh wait. END
BEGIN NOW    that is like. END
BEGIN NOW     all day , everyday. END
BEGIN NOW     Welp, alrighty then. END
BEGIN NOW    LOVE this bar!  It's charmingly divey, without being disgusting. END
BEGIN NOW    unlike this one bar I went to recently who's name I will not mention where patrons just dropped trou' and urinated all over the bloody patio - sorry, but that's just nasty. END
BEGIN NOW     I digress. END
BEGIN NOW     H&amp;D's bartenders are hella' friendly and they pour heavy. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, I can typically hold my booze pretty well and one $10 pint-glass-sized-long-island had me buzzing preeetty hard. END
BEGIN NOW      There's a pool table that's almost always occupied by friendly people who are happy to work you into the rotation, puppies! (yes, puppies. END
BEGIN NOW     It's dog-friendly), a nice outdoor patio for the smokers, tasty food just next door, a jukebox, arcade games, and an ATM machine (they don't take cards). END
BEGIN NOW      It's really nice to have this bar within walking distance of our house. END
BEGIN NOW      It's by far the best neighborhood bar I've experienced yet. END
BEGIN NOW    For saving my arse literally. END
BEGIN NOW     And having clean facilites. END
BEGIN NOW    I had  Trader's Joes and was loaded up with my bags when the urge hit to use the Bathroom like super bad like Damn I wish I had on a Diaper Bad like I might have to take a shit right here right now on the sidewalk and be on the bus hella shitty- like ( and deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW     I dropped my bags and rushed into the Bar praying it would be friendly and not you-gotta buy-to shit. END
BEGIN NOW     I was id checked ( I do look like a kid) and raced to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Praying no body else would have to come in cause the bathroom was super tiny with one stall and no way to pretend the stink wasn't emerging from me. END
BEGIN NOW    And there it goes a female patron enters just as I uh let go. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't help but smell that!-Sigh- Oh well I am grateful it went down this way and not on the bus (feeling deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW    Well made, quality drinks with a cool dive bar feel. END
BEGIN NOW     There's pinball and pool which makes it great for bro-nights. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons are stylish and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I really like the back patio area. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is very cool. END
BEGIN NOW      Great drinks and service. END
BEGIN NOW      Next time I hope to get a spot on the über-cool patio. END
BEGIN NOW      I can't remember the last time I had booze and played the video game Galaga (spelling?) Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    This used to be the go-to bar for my friends and fellow Bay Area Derby girls. END
BEGIN NOW     It was our hang out, we've given them a lot of business. END
BEGIN NOW     But then today after a beautiful sunny day and a skate around the lake we decided to stop in for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     We looked on the outside for any sign about "no shoes, no service" but there wasn't one so we went in. END
BEGIN NOW     Two of us had shoes, I did not. END
BEGIN NOW     We proceeded to order our drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     We saw a cute dog sitting on a bar stool and gave it some love. END
BEGIN NOW     I got my beer and then a manager type abruptly told us we had to take our skates off, so we did. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends and I grabbed our drinks and headed to the beer garden in the back (me in my socks). END
BEGIN NOW     I took a few sips of my refreshing beer and Miss Cranky Pants told me that I must be wearing *shoes* or I have to leave. END
BEGIN NOW     I did not have shoes so I got my money back from my beer and left the premises. END
BEGIN NOW     It's too bad the woman was so prickly. END
BEGIN NOW     The woman could've been much friendlier and more professional in her approach towards us but she treated the three of us with such disdain that it left us confused and surprised about her behavior. END
BEGIN NOW     There was no sign posted about shoes in the front (only a sign about a 2 drink minimum). END
BEGIN NOW    they allow dogs in the establishment and they allow people to smoke pot AND there is no handicap access to the establishment. END
BEGIN NOW    but somehow stocking feet is not acceptable? Would they ban people in bare feet wearing flip-flops? The rules just seem a little off and we certainly didn't deserve the rude treatment. END
BEGIN NOW     Me, my friends, and the Bay Area Derby girls will not be returning to the Heart &amp; Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    Proud to say this is my neighborhood bar! Love the atmosphere, puppy dogs and staff!. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't usually review bars, but I loooooove Heart and Dagger! Beers are yummy, drinks are pretty good, but the best part is the patio. END
BEGIN NOW     People bring their dogs back there, it's awesome!We'll usually come here and chill in the patio, maybe play some pin ball, then move to the next bar. END
BEGIN NOW     We usually hit up Lanesplitter Pizza afterwords because it's so closeby. END
BEGIN NOW     Delish. END
BEGIN NOW    Bah! This bar has so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes! Go on a sunday and get mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW     Sit out in the patio, and enjoy your day. END
BEGIN NOW     then go wander to the lake and stare at the hobo geese eating cigarette butts. END
BEGIN NOW    Noooooo, don't go on a regular night. END
BEGIN NOW     the shape of the place is sooo weird and awkward, either you're in the way of the pool table or standing by a pole in the front, squeezed by the bar, or freezing in the back patio slowly absorbing lung cancer. END
BEGIN NOW     I asked for a gin and tonic and got soda and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW     talk about the most extreme of a buzz kill. END
BEGIN NOW      Soda is the hill billy cousin to city gal tonic. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, just because this bar is called Heart &amp; Dagger doesn't mean you get to be a mean jerk. END
BEGIN NOW    I repeat, get week-end day drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool, neighborhood-y bar with a lovely back patio area, a friendly staff and a great selection of beers and booze. END
BEGIN NOW    There's good affordable food nearby and the place is usually filled with friendly locals. END
BEGIN NOW    I dig it!. END
BEGIN NOW    So, my friend just moved to the bay area from good ol' NYC, and we decide to have a night out on the town, to welcome her to Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Granted, we're both tired and lame after a week of work, so a night out on the town ends up consisting of one drink then home. END
BEGIN NOW    HOWEVER. END
BEGIN NOW    My one drink was a super cheap aged Jameson, and hers was a super cheap PBR tallboy. END
BEGIN NOW      WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    We met my friend there whose pet pug (I'm sorry, he's a service dog, for real) is a regular at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, he sits on a bar stool. END
BEGIN NOW      WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    We headed out back where it was beautiful outside, despite being the end of October. END
BEGIN NOW      WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    On the back patio, my friend starts getting agitated. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't know why. END
BEGIN NOW      I realize it's because half the people here are not just smoking cigarettes, and where she's been living, that's still illegal. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean, technically, it is here too, but really: WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger is a great dive bar located near the historic Grand Lake Theater, conveniently nestled amongst other eateries and shops. END
BEGIN NOW    - easy going vibe- back patio- outside food friendly (you can bring your own)- dog friendly-  fun (pinball, pool table, juke box)- be sure to bring photo ID - i. END
BEGIN NOW    e. END
BEGIN NOW     license, passport. END
BEGIN NOW     State law requires that every patron have one (even if you look 21+) otherwise they get fined big time. END
BEGIN NOW    - cash only (ATM on the premises). END
BEGIN NOW    CASH ONLY! cool patio in the back and cool staff. END
BEGIN NOW     nice local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW     it's very low key and chill. END
BEGIN NOW     i'd go back if i was in the area and it was happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    Went on a whim after a friend recommed the place to me. END
BEGIN NOW    I had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     and too much to drink. END
BEGIN NOW    lol. END
BEGIN NOW     they ordered me a cab and someone offered to move my car for me since they had street sweeping early the next morning. END
BEGIN NOW    what a nice thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW    I would totally go back the vibe was pretty cool and the bartender was great. END
BEGIN NOW    biker looking guy with a goatee. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd like to give props but, I can't remember his name. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW    Well, this was a fun night!  A little dive-y, dark, and grungy, but I live down the street and have always wanted to see inside!  I ended up getting a mimosa for 4$ (I think. END
BEGIN NOW    ) which was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      The back patio is pretty cool, but I couldn't stay long because it was beyond freezing the night I went. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, do you think it might be a good idea to put lights outside?  Or, more lights outside?  I mean, its cool and all to sit and drink in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW     but more fun to see the person you came with!  I really prefer the two seater RIGHT by the windows inside by the bar- so quaint and cozy!I read they once had a mechanical bull. END
BEGIN NOW     am I wrong?  If they did, crowds would multiply, and I would be there every Sat!. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent place, but the bartender could certainly have been less of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW    What other bar would explicitly say on their website that their mission is to have cheap drinks with no cover?Hey, Yelp stalkers (that are dwindling in numbers every day)! Want to stalk for reals? I'm here every Friday without fail because this bar is so freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     Though it's not on the ridiculously cheap Happy Hour special list ($3 drafts and well drinks), their Dirty Martinis are some of the best I've ever had (still at a super cheap price!). END
BEGIN NOW    Do yourself a favor and get there early to snag a seat on the outdoor patio under the lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW     The Heart and Dagger has friendly service (I need not mention their predecessors), friendly patrons, and an all together relaxed and fun vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only, and watch out. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll probably steal your seat on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW    Eek! Methinks not. END
BEGIN NOW    That's exactly how I feel about this place, and the bartender helped out with that feeling. END
BEGIN NOW      By the way this is no Zeitgeist!  That's like calling Taco Bell authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW      Anyway. END
BEGIN NOW    Me and my lady walked in Sunday late evening around 7ish not packed but there was people. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought the layout was nice, games are cool, and yes the Jukebox is the God of Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW      Trust me if it weren't for that jukebox they might have got 1 star. END
BEGIN NOW      Ordered tequila with club soda and a bloody mary for the first round. END
BEGIN NOW      Hmmm I've had better and I wasn't feeling the bartenders dry attitude. END
BEGIN NOW      It's not like I wanted her to do cart wheels but damn girl smile at least. END
BEGIN NOW      We stepped outside to feel the vibe out there since there wasn't much of a vibe at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Beautiful lemon tree, plenty of awkward seating, and a big bummer is you can't hear the music outside. END
BEGIN NOW      We decided one more drink and depending on the bartenders attitude we would decide if we where going to stay or leave. END
BEGIN NOW    Shot of Fernet please and one more tequila with club soda. END
BEGIN NOW      I received what seemed like half a shot for 6 bucks and a half ass thanks. END
BEGIN NOW      The guy next to me ordered a shot of Fernet too and it was beyond obvious his shot was double what was in my glass. END
BEGIN NOW      Whatevs I finished my shot and left. END
BEGIN NOW      You guys can all have this place cause it ain't fulfilling my drunk lover needs. END
BEGIN NOW    From the outside, it looks like someone simply converted their quaint little house into a public bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Inside is a bit more rock n roll, loud music and pool. END
BEGIN NOW     $2 PBR tallies make pretty much any hole in the wall a worthwhile stop for a drink or two. END
BEGIN NOW     The back patio is perfect for a summer evening but gets crowded fast as most of the room out there is taken by tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog friendly despite not having the friendliest of dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    You know what I like? Booze. END
BEGIN NOW     You know what else I like? A bar that will give me said booze at a price that won't break my wallet (Ummmm, hello? Uptown? Your $8. END
BEGIN NOW    00 Maker's shot can eat a bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW    )This place is totally going to hit five stars soon. END
BEGIN NOW     There are still a lot of small details that are getting worked out but you know what? The owners are hands on and working on them. END
BEGIN NOW     I see them there almost every single night greeting people, talking to them about improvements. END
BEGIN NOW     hell, I even saw one of them leave their guests they had come in with to help one of their bartenders who had gotten slammed and lost in the weeds. END
BEGIN NOW    I've read the accusations of this place being racist and I just don't know what the hell you people are talking about. END
BEGIN NOW     I can go on about it but giving it any more space than two sentences is giving credence to a line of bullshit that is just reDONKulous. END
BEGIN NOW     There are few places in Oakland that I've found that allow me to feel comfortable with a wide array of friends. END
BEGIN NOW     I can have this as my place to start the night, spend the night, or end the night. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh - did I mention that Lanesplitters usually drops off pizza when they close? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     free drunk food. END
BEGIN NOW     All you one-star givers can join to Uptown on eating their bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW    I knew I would like this place when this was on the juke box while I entered youtube. END
BEGIN NOW    com/watch?v=BIvk… There was once a time when this place was the Serenader and that place scared the daylights out of me. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons would shout at me when I walked past and I figured that heckling/intimidating patrons with the potential to scare off customers and I totally wrote about it on Yelp and it was #$%&amp;ING FLAGGED AND REMOVED because I violated TOS. END
BEGIN NOW     Well, ha, it took two years for them to pull it. END
BEGIN NOW     And, well, ha, MICHELLE S. END
BEGIN NOW     WILL NOT BE SILENCED! HAHAHAHA!Sorry. END
BEGIN NOW    Anyway, some time ago, I reviewed Zietgiest and was so pissed that the patios seemed to be in SF rather than in the warmer climate of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Guess what! Enter Heart and Dagger Saloon! I finally stumbled in to check this place out yesterday afternoon (they open at noon or 1 pm on the weekends) and it was a very great anti-brunch and anti-farmer's market thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons are very talkative and approachable. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is super friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW     They have an impressive bourbon collection and two types of sangria. END
BEGIN NOW     And, most importantly, a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    Now if the Oakland Tamale guy would stop doing the Telegraph bars and come here instead. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     The name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW     The best thing about this bar is they have cheap drinks and they have a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not a fan of going to bars where you can bring dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm from the super duper old school. END
BEGIN NOW     Dogs should stay their little furry butts at home. END
BEGIN NOW     As soon as i walked my fly butt out side to find a seat. END
BEGIN NOW     The most ugliest poodle walked up to me and started liking my leg. END
BEGIN NOW     This dog was going in for the kill, his nose was going further up my dress. END
BEGIN NOW     I literally started screaming and telling the dog to get the hell away from me. END
BEGIN NOW     OK i think yawl get the hint I'm not a dog lover. END
BEGIN NOW     Now don't get me wrong I like dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Bottom line Heart and Dagger the name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW     Please don't spend to much of your life at this bar unless you rock outfits that have skull and bones on them. END
BEGIN NOW     Get my drift. END
BEGIN NOW    3 terrific pinball gamesAttack from Mars (Bally)Creature from the Black Lagoon (Bally)Arabian Nights (Williams)$3. END
BEGIN NOW    50 PBR TallboysDecent jukebox (no autotunes)Mellow people (seemed free of hipsters. END
BEGIN NOW    ). END
BEGIN NOW    I have never been treated so rudely by a bartender (and we all know how they can be sometimes, lol). END
BEGIN NOW     But imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the self-proclaimed OWNER of the place. END
BEGIN NOW     I am still just shocked by her blatant disrespect of my friends and I, I still have absolutely no idea why we were treated in this fashion-- the only cause i could speculate is that I was with mostly people of color. END
BEGIN NOW     shocking for Oakland, but i have racked my brain and that is the only thing i can come up with. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender did not want us there from the second we walked in and she made that very clear. END
BEGIN NOW     Nor did she even care when I tried to address the matter with her, happy to hear she had lost all of our business forever. END
BEGIN NOW     I see that a few other reviewers had similar experiences, how sad. END
BEGIN NOW    All's I know is that I know a LOT of bars in Oakland that at least pretend to care about their customers. END
BEGIN NOW     I will never go back to this bar, it's certainly no good to be so blatantly disrespected, but I'm certainly not going to PAY to be treated that way. END
BEGIN NOW     lol. END
BEGIN NOW    I just moved to Lakeshore from Montclair, and you know what excites me?  The fact that I can walk to a bar and stumble home late at night after. END
BEGIN NOW      You know what doesn't excite me?  The fact that Heart and Dagger Saloon of Oakland is my local bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Let's be honest, I haven't seen this many white people together in one place since Oakland's First Friday (or as I lovingly call it, "White Night"). END
BEGIN NOW      The lay out is funky . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     especially the VIP raised table right as you walk in the door. END
BEGIN NOW      The outside is nice and I will definitely try it again in the summertime, but really, I don't want to go anywhere that makes my "ethnic" friends feel uncomfortable . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    Looks like we're going to Easy. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger is a-okay. END
BEGIN NOW     The patio is gigantic, probably more room out there than in the actual bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices were reasonable, but comparisons to Lucky 13 or similar bars with awesome beer selections and divey vibes are a bit uncalled for; there aren't that many beers on tap, and the crowd there (Saturday afternoon) was more likely to be reading the paper than to be chatting it up with fellow bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog friendly though!. END
BEGIN NOW    i dunno what i was expecting when i heard this was a biker dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    maybe a little more dive and a little more hott bikers. END
BEGIN NOW    ? parking was easy, directly across the street. END
BEGIN NOW    and well, the spot itself is pretty cool inside with pool tables, pinball machines, and a jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender worked up some strong drinks and the other patrons were pretty accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW    the patio area was pretty big lined up with park benches to share, but the lighting def needs improving so us cougs could see which cubs are available to hunt! some of my biker friends rave about this spot because of it being biker friendly and maybe it just wasn't the night for them to be there. END
BEGIN NOW    so i'll be back and give it another try, maybe on a saturday. END
BEGIN NOW    check back and i'll let you know!. END
BEGIN NOW    Walked in here for the first time and was like "so THIS is what the Serenader looks like from the inside!"Great out door patio, stiff cheap drinks, good jukebox, men with facial hair . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     sign me up!. END
BEGIN NOW    Where everybody knows your name!We have been going to the Heart and Dagger since it opened, usually with me draped in my cool H and D swag. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a throwback to a great neighborhood bar, with a little punk thrown in. END
BEGIN NOW     We went last night to reintroduce our recently transplanted friends back to the amazing-ness that is the Bay Area, and ran into a group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW     That is what I love about this place! Knowing that our friends all go there, and that we can catch up and hang out on the patio for hours is awesome!Boozy Suzy always makes me a delicious custom made drink when I am hanging out with all of the beer drinking boys, which puts a smile on my face every time. END
BEGIN NOW    The boys love getting Lane-Splitters for dinner, and staying and talking the night away. END
BEGIN NOW     Now, if I can only get Lane Splitters to carry gluten free pizza, I would never leave!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are looking for a dive bar, you can't do much better than this in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks are cheap, there's a great outdoor seating area and plenty of people watching. END
BEGIN NOW     It gets a little smokey in the patio, but what do you expect from outdoor seating at a bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Pinball and Pool are also big pluses. END
BEGIN NOW    Love the fact that karaoke is not and never will be allowed!They pour great drinks with great prices and a very fun crowd to watch. END
BEGIN NOW    Check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW    I love, love love love Heart and Dagger! It's about time that Oakland got a decent rocker/biker/alternative bar!I've heard people call it a "dive bar" but it's anything but. END
BEGIN NOW     If you love Zeitgeist in SF, imagine a smaller, east bay version. END
BEGIN NOW     That's what you get at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    Plus, you can actually go and get a few drinks and not spend more than $20. END
BEGIN NOW     The jukebox is loaded with bitchin' tunes. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     The place is Dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     And they let you bring in food from other places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     And once in a while, Lane Splitters will bring by free pizza that's left over at the end of the night or wrong orders. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cozy and comfy. END
BEGIN NOW     All races, genders, gays, straights welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     It's nice to see a diverse alternative culture and not feel like you walked into a snobby hipster bar for once. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger has certainly become my version of "Cheers!". END
BEGIN NOW    I dig this bar, I really do. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is friendly (even the door guys are nice) and there's usually a fun crowd inside. END
BEGIN NOW     My favorite time to visit Heart and Dagger is on a lazy Sunday when the back patio is filled with dogs, cigarettes and tall boys. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks are reasonably priced, has every amenity you'd ever ask of a dive, and the bathrooms aren't gross! I can only speak for the Men's bathroom, though. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, if you're hungry, Lanesplitters (as well as other awesome grub) is right next to Heart and Dagger, and the bar is totally cool with you bringing a pizza box in to share with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Additional bonuses: 3 pinball tables and an ATM machine. END
BEGIN NOW     When their ATM machine isn't working, there's a bank 50 feet away. END
BEGIN NOW     The only negative: When the outside patio is closed and the bar is packed, the inside of the bar will make you claustrophobic. END
BEGIN NOW    If I've said it once, I've said it a million times:  This place is great as long as the back yard stays open. END
BEGIN NOW      When they shut it down and start hustling us in at 11 or 11:30 or whenever it is, it is just way too small to accommodate us. END
BEGIN NOW      Inevitably this results in an additional trip either back to the Kona or the Ruby Room. END
BEGIN NOW    I know they're trying to be good neighbors and I can respect that, but the early nightly closing of the outside is a total buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW    While my pals and I were wandering around Oakland on a sunny day, we came here to get a drink and sit at their outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a bit of a 30-something meat market. END
BEGIN NOW      Since we were not really out on the prowl, it was a sort of hilarious scene. END
BEGIN NOW      We drank mimosas and watched a group of British men hit on any women who'd have them. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't know about what it's like at night or when it's cold, but I found it quite enjoyable in the lovely Oakland sun. END
BEGIN NOW      Not really worth a trip to the East Bay, but good if you're already there. END
BEGIN NOW    3. END
BEGIN NOW    5 stars!It gets knocked back from 4 because the only beer I (kinda) like there is Sierra Nevada. END
BEGIN NOW      But this is a great last stop for when you don't care anymore and you just want to knock back a PBR tallboy or two. END
BEGIN NOW     Classy!   Anywaaaays, it may not be the classiest joint but it is a lot of fun -- there are little video games, a pool table, and a large outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      The TVs play the randomest crap, and everyone there is just chillin'. END
BEGIN NOW      Gets a little crowded, but that's part of the fun. END
BEGIN NOW     And when you finally get kicked out, the Taco Guys sometimes park their truck outside, so you can grab an organic, free-range, vegetarian-fed taco (it's very important for your 2 a. END

BEGIN NOW    Pitchers, pinball, patio! Great neighborhood dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     good location, average prices, dogs outside. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely plan on going back regularly. END
BEGIN NOW    This is now the bar I call my neighborhood favorite. END
BEGIN NOW      I love that it has an outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      The one downside is that I'm a nonsmoker so if it's crowded it's hard to get away from the smokers but it's worth it to me to sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy a beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The beers are priced great, especially if you get there early enough for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW      Dogs are allowed in the back which offers some entertainment if there are a few there. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders have always been very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I haven't been back in a while since the weather has been cold but the next warm, sunny day I have off work I know where I'm headed. END
BEGIN NOW    If the Lexington in SF and Zeitgeist in SF had a love child it would be Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     In recent years there has been a gaggle of gays moving over to Oakland, myself included, and we needed a gayborhoody hangout. END
BEGIN NOW     I do believe Heart and Dagger fits the bill! A group of us went to Heart and Dagger and we knew we were "home" when Gary, any dyke worth her weight knows this doorman, greeted us! There were hugs all around! He has been working the door at some infamous lesbian parties in SF for years. END
BEGIN NOW     He is an East Bay boy so he is right at home at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar has that "cozy" Lex feeling and the backyard is like Zeigeist's little sister. END
BEGIN NOW     There is also a pool table indoors and it's surrounded by tons of raggedy old bar stools and a couple throne type areas to chill in. END
BEGIN NOW     Random, but welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW     Good, full bar with some attractive bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     Always a bonus! Prices were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     And don't worry hip straighties, it is a diverse crowd and everyone seems to be welcomed with open arms. END
BEGIN NOW     We like that. END
BEGIN NOW     Diversity good. END
BEGIN NOW     Let's do the math: Cool hangout space+good bar with good prices+backyard space+Gary at the door+plenty of parking across the street = a sweet little gayborhoody spot we plan to frequent. END
BEGIN NOW    Eek!  Methinks never again. END
BEGIN NOW    Went here a few times and thought it was alright. END
BEGIN NOW      After having my bike tires slashed and the bartender refusing service saying "I don't serve blonds" to my male friend. END

BEGIN NOW     Its smaller than you expect but the folks tend to be friendly and loud. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a good time and theres tons of parking across the street. END

BEGIN NOW    Bar tender was friendly &amp; helpful with beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW    Mixed crowd on my visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Parking was no big deal (right across the steet. END
BEGIN NOW    A big improvement from the last sh*#hole bar previously residing @ this location. END
BEGIN NOW    Patio looks to be a good spot for hot summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW    Go already!!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved the pinball and the backyard seating! Cash only so come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW     Great spot for a bloody mary on a Sunday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW     Bring your pooch along!. END
BEGIN NOW    When this place first opened up, I thought it was pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW      I loved the pinball, back patio &amp; the jukebox was pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW      However, over the last year I've gone there, my impression declined from "great" to "okay" to "absolutely never again will I set foot in the place". END
BEGIN NOW      The first reason I started going was for the pinball, but whatever company leases the machines to the bar (California Amusement Group?) does not keep them in good repair. END
BEGIN NOW      Since they opened, I've been there to play the machines multiple times, and each time, every single one of the 3 games were in such disrepair as to make the game almost a complete waste of money because you couldn't make key shots for scoring (like an intermittent or weak flipper, or a semi-functioning plunger). END
BEGIN NOW      Eventually, I stopped going there as often because of that, but gave it another chance a couple nights ago because my friend's friend was having a birthday party there - BIG mistake. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend (also female) and I waited at the bar to get a drink for over 20 minutes while the bartender completely ignored us, giving no eye contact &amp; no acknowledgement that she saw us, while serving everyone else at the bar, including people who had clearly come up to the bar after us. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm pretty patient when a bar is crowded, because I understand that it's not an easy job. END
BEGIN NOW      However, as we got passed over, time &amp; time again, it was obvious that the bartender just did not want to serve us. END
BEGIN NOW      WTF?  There was even some jerk standing fully behind me who leaned over my shoulder &amp; shouted - "pitcher of Trumer" - who got served while we were still waiting there!  Finally, there was guy standing next to my friend who could see what was going on (who had also come up AFTER us), and then sure as sh*t, the bartender came up to ask HIM what he wanted, so he pointed to us and said "these ladies were first", and she scoffed &amp; said something totally dismissive like "okay whatever" and then reluctantly asked what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW      After she served us, she started ignoring the guy who pointed out that we were next. END
BEGIN NOW      Okayyyyy - wow. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not sure why we got that kind of treatment, but it felt pretty crappy. END
BEGIN NOW      I sortof wondered whether it was because I was an obvious dyke. END
BEGIN NOW      I couldn't think of any other reason why we got treated that way, unless maybe the bartender just has a problem with other women in general?  (I've seen other reviews by women here who have mentioned crappy treatment by a female bartender here as well). END
BEGIN NOW      In any case, regardless of the reason, this bartender obviously did not want me &amp; my friend's business, and the owners don't care that their patrons get ripped off on their janky pinball machines either, so Mission Accomplished!!!  I will never go there again!Sad, because it had so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW    My favorite neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cozy. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons are young, diverse, attractive, and take good care of themselves. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar staff and security are really friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice change from comparable larger venues in the City. END
BEGIN NOW     This is where I plan to bring my friends this summer. END
BEGIN NOW    The music hits all my sweet spots--blues, rockabilly, punk, HEAVY METAL. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is good enough for me--and it's cheap! And if I overkill (which I almost never do anymore) I live right up the street and could crawl home if necessary. END
BEGIN NOW     Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     If grog and whiskey ain't your thing, then be sure to ask for a Suzie-kazi if Boozie Suzie is slingin shots. END
BEGIN NOW    Need something to pad the sauce so you can see straight despite beer goggles? Head over to Lanesplitter's right next door--OR DRINK SOME MORE UNTIL YOU'VE DRUNK YOURSELF SOBER. END
BEGIN NOW    I thought this place was cute. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks were great and super cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     We went on a Friday night around 9 and it was packed. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought the outdoor space was great. END
BEGIN NOW     It had cute brick/cobble stone floor, lots of stringed lights and the cutes local puppy. END
BEGIN NOW     I will say that the layout is ridiculous, they could have fit way more tables or at least some drink holding counters. END
BEGIN NOW     i spent most the night reorganizing the space layout in my head. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd seemed a little young, college- single types, but everyone was friendly and calm-ish. END
BEGIN NOW     However it was only 9 and the party was just beginning. END
BEGIN NOW    they have pool table and pin-ball but they were packed and unlikely to be able to play. END
BEGIN NOW    All-n-all: i would go back for a beer and hang. END
BEGIN NOW     but after we left here, we stumbled upon all that is holey in Dive Bars. END
BEGIN NOW      Smitty's Cocktails, review to follow!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger is my neighborhood  bar hangout. END
BEGIN NOW     For those in the Grand Lake area, it really is convenient which adds to it's draw. END
BEGIN NOW     It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     It has a cool motorcycle vibe and some tough looking characters that frequent. END
BEGIN NOW     While it has some diversity of character, however, it really is a hipster-ific bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Lanesplitters, the next door pizza joint, will often deliver the pizza at the end of the night. END
BEGIN NOW     GREAT outdoor patio with a fun lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW     In three words: cheap, convenient and cool. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything I want in a bar: cheap drinks, comfortable back yard to sit and drink in (complete with a huge lemon tree in the center), good jukebox, decent not-to-cool-for-school bartenders, a first person shooter video game, and a non-douchey clientele. END
BEGIN NOW    I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW    Can you say cheap drinks? Well, I use to pop up at this place before Heart and Dagger took over. END
BEGIN NOW     The mgmt kept changing and it wasn't always safe to go, but they had great bands. END
BEGIN NOW     It was called Serenadas. END
BEGIN NOW     Soooooooo, the bar was finally sold to someone who knows what to do. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartenders are super fast, super friendly, and always something weird, or interesting on their tv sets. END
BEGIN NOW     They have pool, playing machine, and a HUGE patio for smoking. END
BEGIN NOW     Did I already say cheap drinks?The music is a variety of rock, heavy metal, non heavy metal, and all sorts of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW      Now, hopefully your a dog lover because you might see a few dogs or cats. END
BEGIN NOW     Hard to describe the crowd, but everyone seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, for the 3rd time, cheap drinks!!!!! Oh, they occasionally give you free pizza from next door. END
BEGIN NOW    Who cars about dog, different music, or anything else if you getting served cheap fast drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     There are 4 other bars in the area if you don't like this one. END
BEGIN NOW     Right by the grand theatre, plenty of cabs, near the bus line, so no excuse for you not to go. END
BEGIN NOW     Check it out!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW    The patio is large and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Employees are nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Bouncer is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     Pinball. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool regulars to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW     The lock on the bathroom door works (hard to find at bars). END
BEGIN NOW     Free parking in a lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW     Off the top of my head, last night I can remember hearing Faith No More, High On Fire, The Cramps, and Slayer. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender was wearing a Minor Threat shirt and they had Grindhouse playing on the TV when I walked in around 5:30. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a few doors down from Lanesplitters, who donates the delicious pizza they don't sell at the end of the night to hungry bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW    Last time hanging out on the patio, I witnessed a Blue Heron take a GIANT crap on a couple of screaming girls. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a great place. END
BEGIN NOW    Good prices, pool table, good juke, and a PATIO! A backyard patio is so rare here in Oakland, so it scores. END
BEGIN NOW    A lot of reviewers seem to have had problems with the bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     I haven't. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd is cool, too. END
BEGIN NOW     Good people. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd like to have a bit more room inside, and maybe a second pool table, but other than those tiny things, this place rocks. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is pretty great. END
BEGIN NOW    The drinks are cheap here. END
BEGIN NOW     &amp; of course, like most of the dive bars -it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     Luckily they have a BoA and CHASE within walking distance. END
BEGIN NOW     There's also this awesome pizza place next door to go to feed your intoxicated needs. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall a great dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    a WHOLE lot better than the Ruby Room or Radio. END
BEGIN NOW    (I think its the same owner?). END
BEGIN NOW     The backdoor patio could use a little more lighting though and that nasty lonely blue bulb should be replaced. END
BEGIN NOW    4 stars as room for growth. END
BEGIN NOW     Great little rock and roll neighborhood bar!(too clean to call it a 'dive')They've got  a pool table, a few pinball machines and one of those table ms. END
BEGIN NOW     pacmans. END
BEGIN NOW    Decor is cute, place is clean, and the jukebox is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm really excited about 2 things at this place:#1. END
BEGIN NOW     Tuesday nights. END
BEGIN NOW     (For DML)#2. END
BEGIN NOW     The back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I can just imagine the awesomeness of meeting friends for booze brunches, or cooling off on balmy(ish) summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW    We wanted to get something to eat after the horrifying West Elm/Pottery Barn warehouse sale a couple weekends back and stumbled upon this place. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is great - a bunch of food and beverage spots all under one roof. END
BEGIN NOW     Kind of reminds me of Gotham West Market in NYC. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the pork tacos smothered in a red sauce, topped with pickled onion and cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW     The two tacos came with a side of pinto beans. END
BEGIN NOW     It was good, the pork was tender, the beans were also good. END
BEGIN NOW     I do agree with most of the other reviews on price, it is kind of steep. END
BEGIN NOW     I think it was $12/$13 for two tacos and some beans. END
BEGIN NOW     the tacos were little so I am not sure why they command such a high price. END
BEGIN NOW     But they were good! If I was in the area again, I would go back for sure. END
BEGIN NOW    A friend said yeah let's go its delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      No. END
BEGIN NOW     It's over priced mexican food that wants to be good for you. END
BEGIN NOW     I ate a torta and may never come here again unless I need to feel good about my food choices or maybe I'll get a salad or something. END
BEGIN NOW      So don't go thinking your going to have mexican food as you will be sadly mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW    Love love freakin LOVE this place! The staff are really nice, food is EXCELLENT!! Great spot to eat for lunch even dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     The tostadas on Tuesday are to die for! MUST TRY! MUST TRY! It'll never disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW     P. END
BEGIN NOW    s. END
BEGIN NOW     Pork belly tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean shut up right!. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is one of my "go-tos" for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I have dined here about 6 times and each time it has been really good. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is limited since its a walk up and order place; they do deliver food to the table and are super nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a local place in the "Swan" center with multiple eateries as well as a fish market inside. END
BEGIN NOW      Handmade tortillas and creative "cocktails" (no hard alcohol, but they do make a good "bloody" style drink with cayenne pepper crusted candy sticks (have only seen these in Mexico before). END
BEGIN NOW      Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Oh yeah, I have had pork, fish, shrimp and chicken tacos - all great!. END
BEGIN NOW    Today we got for lunch the crispy wild shrimp tacos and peach salad! Absolutely fantastic and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Although its crowded we found a table with 3 seatings right away. END
BEGIN NOW    AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything i've gotten here has been incredible and i'm a very big fan (in case you couldn't already tell) Their menu changes so there no guarantee that they will have a certain dish a given night. END
BEGIN NOW     However, I was really impressed by the tamale i had here and the chicken anchiote. END
BEGIN NOW     Comes with awesome sides of rice and beans, tortilla and everything tastes so freshly made. END
BEGIN NOW     Some could argue this place is on the pricier side compared to standard Mexican fare, but at first bite you will realize its absolutely worth it and keep coming back like i do. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha, Cosecha, Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     I have such a weird relationship with you. END
BEGIN NOW     I truly do like you, but you are expensive. END
BEGIN NOW     I recognize that quality ingredients and such tastiness do cost money. END
BEGIN NOW     But, spending $15 on 2 shrimp tacos and some beans in downtown Oakland at a pretty casual spot is insane to me?! Were those deliciously large shrimp tacos so tasty? YES, albeit a bit sloppy to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     Plump wild shrimp, tempura fried with some jalapeno on 2 corn tortillas was perfection. END
BEGIN NOW     I went the blue plate special and at $15 with beans, I was shocked. END
BEGIN NOW     I actually think I wish I bought 2 at $5. END
BEGIN NOW    50 per taco. END
BEGIN NOW     :: FRIDAYS only for those shrimp tacos, btw. END
BEGIN NOW    :: So, there, I said it. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't like dropping $15 on a casual lunch, but those shrimp tacos are so worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     I've actually dined here quite regularly for lunch since my move nearby almost a year ago and you always ignite the same reactions. END
BEGIN NOW     When I'm paying, I gulp and say: how much? But, then my food arrives and I enjoy, maybe even savor every bite and can appreciate the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     And although your portions don't seem huge, they are more than enough food and quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW     In the end, Mexican is one of those foods. END
BEGIN NOW     You expect to pay less and when you don't, you're like, excuse me? But man, Cosecha is so tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     From their tacos, to their tortas, to their quesadillas, I've always been impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     *Seating can be a bit of pain, since this spot's located within Swan's Marketplace. END
BEGIN NOW     A co-op of sorts for local restaurants where they share the seating space. END
BEGIN NOW     Lunch time is always packed weekdays, but taking a quick glance at their Saturday brunch makes me think I've been sleeping on this spot for weekend fare. END
BEGIN NOW    * Their guac is a good, but at $5+ for a small dish, it is totally not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW    Amazing Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     Came here for brunch on Sat (just a suggestion, come here early for brunch) and had bacon tacos with eggs and a side of beans. END
BEGIN NOW     All delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     My girlfriend had the waffles (yup, waffles at a Mexican restaurant!) and they were fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW     To round things out I had the Cosecha Margarita and it was delicious, with orange zest and real worm salt around the rim. END
BEGIN NOW     I know we're coming back for more. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha has very good Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     It's located in a food court-esque building, with a few other restaurants that all share common seating. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend and I went in around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was bumpin. END
BEGIN NOW     We both ordered a quesadilla (I had the grilled peppers and chicken, and he had the mushroom and chicken). END
BEGIN NOW     We also shared some chips and salsa, and the iced horchata latte. END
BEGIN NOW     The prices are bit higher than some Mexican restaurants, but I think it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     I was impressed with everything. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought the horchata latte was great, and actually complemented the spiciness of the quesadilla really well. END
BEGIN NOW     The quesadilla was incredibly well prepared, and the salsa served on the side gave the quesadilla a great flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     I really liked the vibe at Cosecha, and the food was great. END
BEGIN NOW     It's definitely one of my new favorite spots in Oakland (along with Zachary's, Drake's Dealership, and OBTOWN). END
BEGIN NOW    Food = excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     Price point = poor. END
BEGIN NOW     Hence the 4 star average. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved my food but as others have mentioned, I don't think it was worth $15/plate. END
BEGIN NOW     Both my SO and I had the Grilled Chicken Anchiote. END
BEGIN NOW     It is served in a cute clay plate over rice with guacamole and a couple tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Perhaps make the guac optional and lower the price a few bucks? The quality was great and they supposedly use fresh, seasonal/ local ingredients which always jacks up price so I get it. END
BEGIN NOW     to an extent. END
BEGIN NOW     But it's also not a sit down restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     It is cafeteria style- in a large building with other restaurants, much like San Pedro Square Market in San Jose if you've ever been. END
BEGIN NOW     Oakland is certainly stepping up it's food game and this was a great example. END
BEGIN NOW     I would recommend this place but don't expect your fav hole in the wall taqueria prices. END
BEGIN NOW    Chicken tacos are so good. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to come back to eat these!Pork belly was ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Verde mole was ok too, spiciness made up for the dull taste. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything taste so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW    Owner was super nice, bringing us our food. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything we ate was delicious and fresh!! We went during the breakfast menu tired the waffles. END
BEGIN NOW     They were stinking amazing Best waffles I ever ate!!!!! We also had the shrimp tacos also great!!! Wish they served dinner early in the morning I would like to have tired the pork tacos . END
BEGIN NOW    Decent Mexican-themed bar at Swan's Market with a modest menu, whether brunch offerings like the huevos cuaouthemoc (two eggs over beans and salsa de arbol, topped with avocado and handmade flour tortillas) or evening fare like a fresh, crispy fish taco. END
BEGIN NOW     They also offer a few nicely done drinks like their pomegranate margaritas. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, the offerings are reasonably delicious, good quality, and presented nicely, although prices are slightly on the elevated side. END
BEGIN NOW     As this is a small stand inside Swan's Market, there aren't many people working here so service may seem a bit overwhelmed or impersonal at times. END
BEGIN NOW     Nevertheless, if you are here at Swan's Market and want something more substantial than, say, sausages, this isn't a bad choice. END
BEGIN NOW    The short: delicious tacosThis is a line-up and they'll bring your order type place. END
BEGIN NOW     At lunch hour, this place is busy and the wait was around 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW     While waiting, we watched some ladies hand-make the tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Mmmm fresh tortillas! Watch out though. END
BEGIN NOW     The tortilla chips are ultra fried and oily; I almost could feel my arteries clogging up. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered the daily special of two fish tacos (Wednesday and Thursday; Friday has shrimp tacos). END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed them and wished there were more than two!This place (Swan's Marketplace) is an agglomeration of other dining eateries, which makes for a loud, crowded and semi-cramped atmosphere, though the afternoon light streaming through was a nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW    I can't remember which paper or publication I first read about Cosecha (weird that it wasn't Yelp - heh), but I distinctly remember that I had to check this place out because it was Dominica Rice-Cisneros', of Chez Pannise fame, new place. END
BEGIN NOW     On my visit, I tried out two dishes: Chilaquiles and Breakfast Tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Both dishes were quite tasty, but it is definitely quality over quantity here! Cosecha sources fresh, local ingredients, so expect to pay a bit more than your regular mobile/taco truck establishment. END
BEGIN NOW     Located in the Housewives Market (Swan's), you will find Cosecha in what I describe as an upscale food court. END
BEGIN NOW     You place your order at the register, get a number and you will get your meal in around ten minutes or so. END
BEGIN NOW     This place was one that I actually went before opening due to its popularity and I had things to do. END
BEGIN NOW    like holiday shopping!There is plenty of street parking!My buddy and I when we totally beat traffic on a Saturday morning:Uh, what time is it?   Ten o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW     They open at 10:30. END

BEGIN NOW    Cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously, try the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW     Simply the best. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is a Mexican eatery with a nouvelle California twist. END
BEGIN NOW     It's located inside old Oakland's Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW     Solid wooden benches-- amenable to communal style seating -- are set up in front of their ordering counter. END
BEGIN NOW     I actually love shared dining like this; seems only fitting for a 'market' context. END
BEGIN NOW    The open wall aspect of this market is attractive; chose to avoid the interior ceiling fans and be warmed by the direct sun. END
BEGIN NOW     People sitting outside were accompanied by their pets. END
BEGIN NOW     The ordering line took just a bit of time. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved observing the hustle and bustle of the open prep station behind the glass. END
BEGIN NOW      While waiting in line, I perused the paper menu pasted onto the glass counter. END
BEGIN NOW      I was there towards the end of weekend brunch (they close at 3:00 p. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW    ) I ordered the wild shrimp tacos and the horchata latte, following the tip from Bon Appetit's August 2015 issue which featured Oakland dining spots including Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      Place your order at the counter and pay, then servers bring your food out. END
BEGIN NOW      The horchata latte was sheer cinnamon-y goodness served in a tall glass-- light, sweet, and tinged with coffee tones. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought it would be the perfect non-dairy counterpoint to spicy Mexican chillies. END
BEGIN NOW      The two corn tortillas piled high with batter-fried shrimp were nicely presented. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp sat on shredded cabbage, were topped with a chili-infused crema sauce and garnished with jalapeno and cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW     The tacos weren't spicy and the cup of beans on the side were well-flavored. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp were high quality and fresh with a firm bite (none of the mealy texture of aquaculture-produced shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW    ) My only gripe might be the quantity size--too small. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices will reveal that this is not another street-stall taco shop although it functions like one. END
BEGIN NOW     I paid around $15 for the gourmet, delicately flavored shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW      This place offers sufficiently unique taste that it's worth a special treat, but it wouldn't be my daily go-to, based on price alone. END
BEGIN NOW      There are plenty of more ordinary tacquerias for everyday dining. END
BEGIN NOW    I was originally attracted to this restaurant due to its iced horchata latte!  When I saw this on the menu I flipped with excitement and headed to Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      I was expecting an conventional restaurant location, but I found myself at a food market. END
BEGIN NOW      By no means was this a bad thing, it added to the ambiance of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is on a other level, often you hear about a place and it gets so hyped up that you are extremely excited to try it and it let's you down when you finally get to try it. END
BEGIN NOW     well this is not that kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW      The flavors are stupefying!  Yes, I looked up a word to describe what I felt when I had the green pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      I returned and tried the fish tacos special and on my next visit I had the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW      Needless to say, I am a big fan of this place and it's authentic and unique spins on classic dishes. END
BEGIN NOW      Only draw back, it's on the expensive side :(. END
BEGIN NOW    Bomb tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Favorites are the pork belly and chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     Veggie is hit or miss - usually too watery. END
BEGIN NOW      Tortillas are freshly made as you wait in line. END
BEGIN NOW     Chips are greasy, crunchy, and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    This food court makes it easy to go out with coworkers when you're craving different cuisines; however, watch where you sit because vendors will get mad and yell at you to move if you sit in the wrong territory (tables are marked for specific restaurants in the shared space). END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     From the salads to the tortillas for the tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything is made fresh to order. END
BEGIN NOW     Love it. END
BEGIN NOW    I have to say the fish tacos were heavenly. END
BEGIN NOW     I am just in Oakland for the night and looking for a cure for my jet lag. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were the blue plate special. END
BEGIN NOW     They came perfectly done - tempura style, crispy with a little bite. END
BEGIN NOW     Beans with a half an avocado came in the side. END
BEGIN NOW     I will definitely come back!!. END
BEGIN NOW    While having a group dinner inside the Swan Market, friends and I tried a few dishes from each of the establishments inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought the service at Cosecha was great and I liked the menu choices. END
BEGIN NOW      Only major gripe was the value. END
BEGIN NOW      For what we paid, I thought was a bit steep for what we actually got. END
BEGIN NOW      We even ordered the happy hour special which happened to be 2 fish tacos and a pint of beer ($12). END
BEGIN NOW      Unfortunately, the battered fish tacos were so small and didn't satisfy. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos looked delicious, but were slightly bland. END
BEGIN NOW      They have 3 beers on tap which you can choose from including Modelo, an IPA and a chocolate stout. END
BEGIN NOW      Our group ended up getting 4 orders of the tacos/beer ($50+). END
BEGIN NOW      If you have a big appetite like me, you may end up spending more money than you anticipate at Cosecha to fill up your belly. END
BEGIN NOW      May come back, but wouldn't get the tacos next time. END
BEGIN NOW    This is the perfect place for a casual lunch or dinner date. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here several times with my friends and always enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha makes anincredible selection of traditional moles utilizing authentic ingredients and old school recipes. END
BEGIN NOW     I recommend the green mole and their fish tacos to any first-time visitors or regulars that are looking for something different to try. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, if you're fan of Horchata definitely try their horchata espresso! It's my favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW    WONDERFUL!!! Best fish tacos that I have had in ages! The chips and salsa were amazing as well. END
BEGIN NOW    Good food. END
BEGIN NOW     Slight bit pricy but it is the Bay Area and it's downtown and it's quality food so it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     The pork belly tacos were good the meat was light but crispy and the salsa on those were to dye for. END
BEGIN NOW     The carne plate was delicious to real good food but dinner doesn't start until 530 so don't come earlier for that or it won't be there. END
BEGIN NOW     I got 3 plates two drinks 50 bucks easily. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been going here for a couple years now and because of my resolution to Yelp consistently I am making up for my lack of a review for Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW    They have brought a nice high end twist to Mexican food and one of the first places to bring some style with substance to the Old Oakland area. END
BEGIN NOW      Since their arrival they've spurned many great eateries to open up around them. END
BEGIN NOW      Through all the change they've still stood strong with their versions of many classics. END
BEGIN NOW     Think high end taco truck without the truck. END
BEGIN NOW     The various tacos and quesadillas are the stars for me here specifically shrimp (when available) and the Mushroom quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     They also do a mean horchatta latte if you are a horchatta fan. END
BEGIN NOW     My only gripes are that shrimp is just a special on a specific day and that prices are a little high to be a weekly regular. END
BEGIN NOW    Very limited menu. END
BEGIN NOW     One friend got the soft tacos with braised pork &amp; a side of beans. END
BEGIN NOW     Delicious, beyond fork tender. END
BEGIN NOW     Fresh, hand-made tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     This was a keeper and the highlight of our meal. END
BEGIN NOW     Another friend got the chilaquiles with salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW     Same fresh tortillas as the tacos except that they were cut into chips and fried. END
BEGIN NOW     Scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. END
BEGIN NOW     The avocado was perfectly ripe and the crema made the whole dish a luscious bite from beginning to end. END
BEGIN NOW     A good dish but after the wow factor of the braised pork, it was anticlimactic. END
BEGIN NOW     I went against the grain and got breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW     The waffle was yummy but different. END
BEGIN NOW     They pulled it from the iron before it formed a crispy crust. END
BEGIN NOW     It was light and fluffy. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior was fully cooked but it was still moist and tender. END
BEGIN NOW     I added the cajeta sauce which is a Mexican-style caramel. END
BEGIN NOW     So good, I was literally scraping the tiny container for every last drop. END
BEGIN NOW     We also got the chips, guac and salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     My advice, skip the chips that were hard and stale and substitute with the fresh tortillas instead. END
BEGIN NOW     For drinks, we sipped on strawberry limeade. END
BEGIN NOW     So yummy, I was chasing the last drop around the ice. END
BEGIN NOW     Located in the old Swan's Market, I liked the vibe of the place. END
BEGIN NOW     It reminded me of a tiny and more homey SF Ferry Building. END
BEGIN NOW     Very similar to San Jose's San Pedro Square Market. END
BEGIN NOW     If Cosecha isn't your style, there were about 4 other stalls including one featuring Japanese food and another serving hot dogs and beer. END
BEGIN NOW     There was also a wine merchant. END
BEGIN NOW     I wish I had a cooler. END
BEGIN NOW     There was a butcher and a fishmonger offering raw product for purchase. END
BEGIN NOW     About 3 blocks from the 12th St. END
BEGIN NOW     Bart station, it easy to get to. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be back. END
BEGIN NOW    I had the most expensive shrimp taco here. END
BEGIN NOW     And it was basically one shrimp and one taco! Over 5bucks after tax. END
BEGIN NOW     I was still hungry afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW    one of my favorites!i've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of my experiences were great. END
BEGIN NOW     the waffle at breakfast, the delicious pico and guacamole, the horchata latte. END
BEGIN NOW    all so delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW    Did someone say vegan quesadillas and strawberry margaritas? If so, I'm all in!I love how Cosecha uses sweet potato in their vegan quesadillas rather than using some fake rubbery cheese substitute. END
BEGIN NOW     They also do not skimp on the guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW     You get some inside the quesadilla itself and some on the side along with a deliciously spicy salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW     You can also choose from mushrooms, green chile, etc to go inside your quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW    The kicker to this meal though, was the asparagus and braised chickpeas. END
BEGIN NOW     It might have been a special, but if you see it on the menu, do not hesitate and order it! The chubbiest asparagus I had ever seen, topped with perfect chickpeas in a really rich saucy broth. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll be dreaming about this asparagus for eternity. END
BEGIN NOW    My strawberry margarita was also memorable. END
BEGIN NOW     It wasn't overly sweet and actually tasted like limes and real strawberries rather than the artificial syrupy stuff. END
BEGIN NOW    All in all, I really enjoyed my meal here at Cosecha from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't wait to try other menu items!. END
BEGIN NOW    In the search of good Mexican food we wanted to love this place, and were really disappointed! We saw this place on KQED and decided to give it a try. END
BEGIN NOW     We were there on a Wednesday around 5, restaurant was pretty empty, no excuse for what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW    Here are my complaints:1. END
BEGIN NOW     PRICES: They are way out of line for counter service &amp; communal seating: $13 for two tiny fish tacos, $15 for Pork Adobado plate, $3 for chips salsa and guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW     There are far better taco places (such as Tracy DeJardin's place in the SF Ferry Building) which are MUCH less expensive, better quality2. END
BEGIN NOW     QUALITY: The food was not prepared well. END
BEGIN NOW     Rice was gummy and EVERYTHING was super greasy. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips and fish tacos were literally swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW     No one drained a damn thing. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were very smelly too. END
BEGIN NOW     Probably should not have eaten them. END
BEGIN NOW     Pork plate was missing avocado and had a few pieces of gross, shriveled zucchini on the side. END
BEGIN NOW     Very unappetizing. END
BEGIN NOW    3. END
BEGIN NOW     PORTIONS: Chip order was sad. END
BEGIN NOW     With only a few cold greasy chips. END
BEGIN NOW     Skimpy on the salsa as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were absolutely tiny and each plated on one small tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW     WAY too expensive for portion size. END
BEGIN NOW     Pork plate had two tiny tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW    4. END
BEGIN NOW     SERVICE: Worker at the counter was barely civil. END
BEGIN NOW     I asked for extra tortillas with our pork plate, forgot them. END
BEGIN NOW     Ticket was cooked wrong- one order came out far in advance of the other. END
BEGIN NOW     The counter worker slammed down the pork plate about a mile away (we were sitting on a big communal table) from us. END
BEGIN NOW     Very abrupt and rude. END
BEGIN NOW    ***I suspect the owner was absent and it showed. END
BEGIN NOW     Place is run poorly! Not a good experience, we will not go back. END
BEGIN NOW    ***. END
BEGIN NOW    We tried their duck special on the weekend and the food was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The dishes are well prepared and the portion sizes were decent. END
BEGIN NOW     They are trying to add a high end twist to their food. END
BEGIN NOW     Their corn tortillas are very good, I think it is freshly made on site very day. END
BEGIN NOW     It is a food court style dining in Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The dining was casual and we could get beer and other food from the other eateries in the food court. END
BEGIN NOW    I noticed many of the other customers getting their wild shrimp taco specials. END
BEGIN NOW     We will try that when we go their next time. END
BEGIN NOW     We did not know this place until we saw them on KQED - Check Please Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW    The owner greets you right away and everything is fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a mushroom and cheese quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     It tasted so fresh!! The next day I had the shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     The best I have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't wait to return. END
BEGIN NOW    It's sad that it's come to this. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to love this place but it seems that in all the trendy-ness and influx of consumers in Oakland, people have just forgotten about customer service. END
BEGIN NOW     In the past I have enjoyed certain dishes from Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     (You have to know what to order here, as their meats can be dry, making certain dishes way overpriced) And usually the service is pretty good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW     My last visit, however, was very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW     The line (which can get long here) wasn't, thankfully and I tried to place my order but before I could do so the owner (the female) called the guy at the register away. END
BEGIN NOW     He was nice about it at first and said he would be right back. END
BEGIN NOW     The owner was giving him instructions which was fine but as he kept trying to come back to me to take my order, she kept pulling him away (keep in mind that she was facing me and fully aware that there was a customer waiting the entire time) until he finally came back to me and said "we are too busy, I have to go help in the back and I can't take your order". END
BEGIN NOW     Are you serious right now? How unprofessional and rude to keep a customer waiting and then ultimately TURN THEM AWAY?!? Get your act together. END
BEGIN NOW    What first called my attention to this restaurant was this Facebook post: facebook. END
BEGIN NOW    com/permalink. END
BEGIN NOW    p…They were obviously more than just a restaurant; they realized the impact of our everyday interactions and are helping taking responsibility as a community towards real change. END
BEGIN NOW     So last week when BART went down halfway through my commute home, my husband had to come pick me up from Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     We decided to have dinner in the area and came here. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm so glad we did! My husband and I split an order of shrimp tacos and carne adobada. END
BEGIN NOW     It was delicious and the meat was very tender. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm also not big on beans but OMG I ate em' up here! Also, homemade tortillas are never a bad idea. END
BEGIN NOW     My 6 year olds had a chicken quesadilla with rice &amp; beans and drank horchata. END
BEGIN NOW     They loved it! Very good food and excellent service. END
BEGIN NOW     I also love the idea that this place is a bit pricey (hear me out!) It's always bothered me so much that people just assume Mexican food has to cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, taco trucks are great and nobody gets mad at a cheap meal but Mexican food can be just as fancy-pants as the rest of ya. END
BEGIN NOW    Today was my first time trying Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the special which was 2 crispy fish tacos and beans with avocado for $11. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was awesome! It is a bit pricey, so I don't think I will be eating here very often, but it was good food and Steve Kerr and his crew showed up and everyone was clapping. END
BEGIN NOW     So for that reason, I will give this place another star. END
BEGIN NOW     LOL. END
BEGIN NOW    Fish taco special is a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW      Can get better fry and quality at Rubios. END
BEGIN NOW     The fry was decent but the fish was whatever. END
BEGIN NOW      The torta made bread soggy, the meat was weak. END
BEGIN NOW      Overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW     Customer service is rude. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely a great Mexican food restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Their menu changes, which keeps things interesting. END
BEGIN NOW     I actually did take out one night and got the mushroom quesadilla and grilled chicken quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     They were both very flavorful and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     Portion size is reasonable for the price. END
BEGIN NOW     I especially liked that they used corn tortilla for the quesadillas. END
BEGIN NOW     I also ordered their chips, which I thought were well salted (which I like) but drenched in grease. END
BEGIN NOW     They were too greasy for me, but I still managed to finish most of them! Also the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW     The person was friendly and helpful on the phone, even though I couldn't decide what to order. END
BEGIN NOW     I picked up my order with no problems! Great experience, will come back to try all of their tacos next!. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm basing this review on food quality as well as service. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a miscommunication on their part which delayed our order. END
BEGIN NOW     My co-worker and I ordered shrimp tacos and honestly they tasted like shrimp donuts. END
BEGIN NOW     We didn't enjoy the batter and there was not enough sauce on the tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall dish it was lacking flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Next time I'm going to Belly's for shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Problem solved. END
BEGIN NOW    WOW. END
BEGIN NOW     The food here is incredible!  The selection is very limited (4-5 items on the menu), but we tried the tacos and quesadilla, and they were both amazing!!!  The meats were moist, tender and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      The sauces were perfect. END
BEGIN NOW      The tortillas were warm and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    This is food court style dining, with an option to purchase beer from one of the other eateries. END
BEGIN NOW      Super casual, you order at the counter and they bring it to you. END
BEGIN NOW     Very delicous. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't wait to come back again!. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm going to eat here again because I only had the totopos but they were great. END
BEGIN NOW     I wanted to try more stuff, but we were doing a day drinking order a bunch of stuff thing so this seemed the most appropriate. END
BEGIN NOW    One of my favorite places to eat in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     They have delicious food that tastes homemade. END
BEGIN NOW     I love their yam/mushroom quesadillas and their seasonal fruit salad with cucumber, pumpkin seeds, jicama, and citrus vin. END
BEGIN NOW    I was here for a business lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu is a little pricey but the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW     To be honest, chips and salsa with guac being close to $6 was a little  excessive. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish tacos, however were worth the cost. END
BEGIN NOW     They tasted great, the fish was fresh, and the plating was pleasing. END
BEGIN NOW     Surprisingly, I was full after the fish tacos even though the portion looked small. END
BEGIN NOW    This was my destination food stand for a while (before the influx of B-Dama, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    ) at Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW     Focus on organic (when possible) ingredients and limited but well executed menu. END
BEGIN NOW     We've brought friends here (HS &amp; MD) who really enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW     J typically gets the tacos, guac + chips. END
BEGIN NOW     Initially, I enjoyed their vegan tacos (been eating here since 2011), but alas, since then, I have noticed more and more salt. END
BEGIN NOW     For the average person who is not sensitive to salt, I would recommend Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW    Went for the New Year's Brunch today!Great food, but their concept of pay, get a number and the food is delivered is not working. END
BEGIN NOW      One of us got their food and the other had to wait a long time for their food. END
BEGIN NOW    We originally chose this restaurant because they were one of the few in downtown Oakland that had outdoor seating for dinner and we had our dog with us. END
BEGIN NOW    Necessity soon turned into luck Sharee as we hungrily dove into fresh vegetables and equally fresh meats. END
BEGIN NOW     My favorite meal was the blood orange salad with grilled chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     It was the perfect mix of flavors with toasted pumpkin seeds butter lettuce and a fresh citrus vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW     Portions are not too large (as I prefer), and prices represent the gentrification occurring in the bay area but still reasonable for the quality of food provided. END
BEGIN NOW    Great spot for post happy hour drunken eats. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the fish tacos, which are excellent, although steep at 13 pesos. END
BEGIN NOW      You basically only get two small fish tacos as well as some rice and beans. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was also pretty slow, it seems they only had one guy running back and forth taking orders at the register and waitering food out to diners. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is always good, but the prices or service are never consistent. END
BEGIN NOW     I paid about 5$ for a meal one day and the next was charged 8$. END
BEGIN NOW     Sometimes they are polite and other days incredibly rude. END
BEGIN NOW    I fell for the ratings. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the fish tacos and if it weren't for the pickled onions and dressing, they would have been plain and boring. END
BEGIN NOW     I was not too pleased. END
BEGIN NOW     Previous commenter called it a"yuppie" Mexican place, I agree. END
BEGIN NOW     Beans and rice were good, service was not so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Be prepared to hunt for napkins, sugar for tea, and a fork in different places. END
BEGIN NOW     Chips were real greasy and stuck together, but salsa was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     I should have tried the other places around here. END
BEGIN NOW     I was really craving authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW     Not the place. END
BEGIN NOW     I must have just ordered the wrong thing. END
BEGIN NOW     So disappointed :-(. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here twice now and was very impressed both times. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly employees, the homemade chips and guacamole are great, as is everything else. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall atmosphere is very friendly as well. END
BEGIN NOW    This shared restaurant space is creative and interesting--kind of like a very upscale food court. END
BEGIN NOW     Food itself is super delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't usually associate Mexican cuisine with haute cuisine--I'm a cheap taco loving girl, after all, but if you're going to do Mexican with fancy ingredients, these guys do it exceptionally well. END
BEGIN NOW     All dishes were delicious and freshly cook. END
BEGIN NOW     Sangria was good, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Massively overpriced and small portions. END
BEGIN NOW     I had two small fish tacos, rice and chips for $20. END
BEGIN NOW     This would cost $10 anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW     Disappointing ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW    The torta is good. END
BEGIN NOW     I have been here several times but today was different. END
BEGIN NOW    I experienced the worst, absolute, worst service I have ever experienced in my life. END
BEGIN NOW     The lady at the register and the owner were ridiculously rude. END
BEGIN NOW     I was surprised at first because the owner is usually smiling, and for the most part, you don't run into issues at the register (register lady is rarely friendly). END
BEGIN NOW     She said I placed the incorrect order over the phone and I'm responsible for paying it (4x the cost of what I ordered). END
BEGIN NOW     This went back and forth for a minute until she finally charged me for the correct order. END
BEGIN NOW     As I was signing the receipt, she told me to never place these small orders over the phone and that they are doing me a favor for this one mistake I made. END
BEGIN NOW     I responded with, "this is bullshit. END
BEGIN NOW    " Both the cashier and owner, became increasingly rude, and at this point, had an aggressive and hostile tone and told me this is my fault. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm a native English speaker with a law degree. END
BEGIN NOW     The cashier has a thick Mexican accent. END
BEGIN NOW     I also had the phone on speaker, with one other person sitting with me (she ordered B-Dama's pork cutlet), when I placed the phone order. END
BEGIN NOW     This order was just for me. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm damn sure I didn't make a mistake. END
BEGIN NOW      She told me to get out, to get out of a DAMN food court. END
BEGIN NOW     I think this is a part of a bigger problem, a growing service culture of attitude and arrogance in Oakland and you're starting to see it in SF. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not sure what is causing the growth of a terrible service culture. END
BEGIN NOW     It is a culture that lacks accountability, responsibility, and respect. END
BEGIN NOW     As a restaurant, you live and die by your patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Each patron is an asset, extremely valuable, and deserving of respect. END
BEGIN NOW     Sure, every restaurant runs into their troll or exceptionally rude customer, but even in this situation, it makes more business sense to take the high road and appease the customer. END
BEGIN NOW     Who knows? maybe this growing attitude in the service culture is a response to Yelp, online trolls, and people constantly sh!&amp;&amp;ing on restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW     Whatever it is, you should never act the way this owner and cashier acted toward me-- irresponsible, immature, condescending, defensive, and hostile. END
BEGIN NOW    While I will never say their tortas are bad because that would be lying, I actually think they are pretty damn good, I will never spend a dollar at a place that lacks the proper decorum. END
BEGIN NOW    Delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW      Just had a quesadilla and pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      So good!  Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Got the huevos cuauhtemoc, breakfast tacos, iced horchata latte, and a mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW     The homemade tortillas make this place. END
BEGIN NOW     HOWEVER, the price and limited seating puts a damper on the experience. END
BEGIN NOW     A great place to try, but doubt becoming a regular. END
BEGIN NOW    We dined on the Saturday specials. END
BEGIN NOW      Chilaquiles, one with a smokey salsa Rojo and one with Verde both were well prepared and tasty as were the Wild shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything was very fresh and made to order. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a good selection of beer &amp; wine. END
BEGIN NOW     It is located in the historic Swan Market building &amp; shares an open dining area with another restaurant &amp; a bar. END
BEGIN NOW      You order, find a table and they deliver to your table. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a lovely fall day and they open the doors and had tables on the sidewalk in addition to the dining hall. END
BEGIN NOW     It is kid friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Yesterday was the second time that I ate at Cosecha, and we came specifically for the Chicken Mole Verde blue plate special that is available on Mondays. END
BEGIN NOW    The first time I had tried Cosecha was on a Friday night when they were featuring Wild Shrimp Tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     They were incredible. END
BEGIN NOW    To me, it is hard to find a fabulous Mexican food/restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     A Mexican restaurant that doesn't put a fusion twist on it, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for ordinary. END
BEGIN NOW     You can find ordinary almost anywhere in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     It's usually always the same. END
BEGIN NOW     My best friend growing up was first generation Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW     The family would get together and cook big regional meals from old family recipes. END
BEGIN NOW     Out of the ordinary, but not necessarily worthy of the hype everyone tends to give for something "out of the ordinary", but it allowed for me to be exposed to really GOOD, "non-traditional" Mexican food at a young age. END
BEGIN NOW    I LOVE Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     I love that they don't have a huge 3 page menu. END
BEGIN NOW     I love that their food is incredibly fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     I love how clean their kitchen appears to be. END
BEGIN NOW     and I love that you can see part of their cooking process. END
BEGIN NOW     Good wait staff too!The food here is like eating someone's secret recipes. END
BEGIN NOW      The food has a "slight" twist to the ordinary, and almost akin to eating in someone's family home. END
BEGIN NOW    The Chicken Mole Verde was fantastic (not your typical mole sauce made with chocolate). END
BEGIN NOW     Consecha's sauce had a little bit of bite/heat to it, but it was spicy without burning your mouth, and without lasting effect. END
BEGIN NOW     So pleasant to eat! To top it off, the chicken was nicely shredded and topped off with roasted pumpkin seeds, and a few slices of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW     The beans. END
BEGIN NOW    not your refried variety, were cooked to the right consistency, not overcooked and falling apart and nicely flavored, as was the rice which also was not your typical Mexican rice. END
BEGIN NOW     It was white rice, though it did not taste like plain white rice. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm sure that also had a secret ingredient. END
BEGIN NOW     Served with warm corn tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW    Did I mention that Cosecha has absolutely the best Horchata that I have ever had? It's not thick, it's not watery, it has a hint of cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW     I would like a glass of it every single day! Very refreshing during warm weather too. END
BEGIN NOW    The food presentation is lovely and equal to any upscale restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Each blue plate special had a nice cloth under each plate. END
BEGIN NOW     The plates themselves were very nice earthenware. END
BEGIN NOW     I just can't say enough about the entire experience. END
BEGIN NOW    As others have said, Cosecha is in the old Swann's marketplace and is more like an open air food court. END
BEGIN NOW      You place your order at the counter, and they bring it to your table. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are hooked on burritos at Chipotle, I would not suggest you go here. END
BEGIN NOW      If you are looking for really good, out of the ordinary, quality Mexican food with that "slight" twist, this is the place for you. END
BEGIN NOW     Not cheap, but not expensive for what you get. END
BEGIN NOW     P. END
BEGIN NOW    S. END
BEGIN NOW      The food portions are perfect, but not "super sized". END
BEGIN NOW      If you are a big eater, you may want to get an appetizer. END
BEGIN NOW    Can't wait to go back!. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is pretty good and I have only been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW     Most recently for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I got the Chilaquiles and we split the waffle. END
BEGIN NOW     The waffle was like butta! The Chilaquiles were really good, but couldn't eat the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW     It's on the pricer side, but good nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was delicious!!! Ordered the quesadilla with peppers and braised pork. END
BEGIN NOW     The tortilla was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     It tasted freshly made. END
BEGIN NOW     The pork was tender. END
BEGIN NOW     It looked small when they brought it out but it was quite filling!! Pomegranate margarita was pretty good, a bit strong. END
BEGIN NOW     The horchata latte looked good will def try that next time. END
BEGIN NOW    Fantastic place! Cosheca is honestly the reason I even started writing yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the pleasure of trying their fish tacos, which were so fresh and had incredible flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     The pinto beans really sealed the deal for me as they had just the perfect amount of seasoning and texture and really complimented the dish. END
BEGIN NOW     Also tried their horchatta latte, which was simply genius. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was very efficient and friendly and my food arrived promptly after ordering. END
BEGIN NOW     I cannot recommend Cosecha enough! Already craving their fish tacos as I write this review. END
BEGIN NOW    Ok those shrimp tacos on Friday are LEGIT. END
BEGIN NOW     We went other times and food was good but didn't knock my socks off. END
BEGIN NOW     We WILL be back for these tacos ASAP!. END
BEGIN NOW    Came on a Saturday for take out brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Had the wild shrimp tacos, strawberry lime drink. END
BEGIN NOW      Amazing!  Even more so was the fact that I got a free chocolate chip cookie. END
BEGIN NOW     All was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    contemplating going back for more!  Definitely my new go to for brunch in Old Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been on the hunt for really good Mexican food since moving to the bay area - living in San Diego (aka, California's Best Border Town) spoiled me rotten. END
BEGIN NOW     There I was treated to the best guacamole and fish tacos north of Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW     When I heard about Cosecha, I was over the moon. END
BEGIN NOW     but while my high expectations probably weren't very helpful, this was definitely not a 5-star experience. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant is buried in a warehouse maze - an interesting space, just a liiiiittle hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW     We had a table reserved, thanks to a friend who plans ahead - but there was no one available to ask about said table. END
BEGIN NOW     There was 1 server running around like a madwoman, and 1 guy at the cash register taking/filling orders, but no one else. END
BEGIN NOW     People were wandering around uncertain as to whether they should seat themselves or wait to be seated. END
BEGIN NOW     we finally went to the wine store next door (which has no door/sign/anything marking it as a separate entity) hoping to get our questions answers. END
BEGIN NOW     The place just seemed completely disorganized. END
BEGIN NOW    So here's how it works! It's family-style self-seating at long picnic tables, unless you make a reservation, and then you can get a private table in the back. END
BEGIN NOW     If you wait for a server to seat you or come to your table, you'll wait forever - order at the front counter, by the register. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu &amp; specials are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but beware: we'd come for the night's special, wild shrimp tacos, but they were sold out by 6pm. END
BEGIN NOW     We were baffled - it was early and the place wasn't even crowded. END
BEGIN NOW     Not cool to sell out of your Dinner Special at the beginning of dinnertime. END
BEGIN NOW     They also need more staff on the floor - for 40 minutes we had water but no glasses. END
BEGIN NOW     Which went well with our chicken/pork tortillas that were missing tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW    The food was good - the kind of good you're psyched to eat, but not the kind of good you'd return for. END
BEGIN NOW     We tried the grilled chicken achiote - chicken marinated in achiote with rice, beans &amp; handmade tortillas, and the carne adovada - braised pork with chile guajillo, beans, rice &amp; tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Really good guacamole!! The tortillas were handmade and delicious; the rest of the dish was fresh but unremarkable. END
BEGIN NOW     The people who work here are incredibly nice - but they're also really overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe now that Cosecha is so popular, they'll make it more user friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    ?. END
BEGIN NOW    Mmmmm!!! Pork belly taco. END
BEGIN NOW     Never had anything like that before. END
BEGIN NOW     You probably think I'm crazy but it had a savory cotton candy like taste. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome haha. END
BEGIN NOW     The horchata was a little gritty. END
BEGIN NOW     The chicken taco also had amazing flavor and was very tender. END
BEGIN NOW    Food court dinning with excellent Mexican food at a moderate price. END
BEGIN NOW      All of the salads are quite nice as well as the Carnitas and tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      It is great on Fridays when the Farmer's market is open. END
BEGIN NOW    Staying in downtown Oakland, we checked out Yelp for a good place for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     Interestingly, on Saturday night, not to many restaurants seem to be open in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW     We found this place interesting per the description, plus it wasn't far from our hotel. END
BEGIN NOW    It's an interesting concept for a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Only a limited menu but the restaurant is more like an upscale cafe stall. END
BEGIN NOW     It's in conjuction with several other similar eateries each having different types of food, like pizza, oysters, all with a common eating  area between them. END
BEGIN NOW      We had the quesadillas and also ordered a margherita  pizza from the pizza stall. END
BEGIN NOW     Very tasty food!! I would have given 4/5 stars, but the portions were really small for the prices paid. END
BEGIN NOW    We're all surely spoiled with the great eats at Swan's Marketplace - my usual entry point is through Rosamunde and I've never quite made it far enough to get to Cosecha - fortunately I went on a Monday when things are just a bit more mellow and conducive to browsing. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried the pork torta with what appeared to be twice fried tortilla chips (no complaints there) and fresh guac - the food was exactly what I was hoping for and the portions were fair. END
BEGIN NOW      Now, spending $17 on a torta, chips &amp; a sparking water is definitely excessive and arguably insane but Cosecha isn't the odd ball when it comes to the modern urban lunch pricing that is nearing $20/person so it's hard to hold that against them. END
BEGIN NOW    The menu is simple and from the looks of the other patrons plates all of the various dishes are a hit - definitely worth a shot. END
BEGIN NOW    especially if you're in the mood for Cholita Linda style food on a Monday (they're closed). END
BEGIN NOW    Simple, and súper delicioso! Had the Blue Plate fish tacos and both my parents - who are hard to please- loved them! Also, the small black bean soup is savory and light. END
BEGIN NOW     We topped it off with the cucumber-lime drink which was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     Tan delicioso que ni siquiera podimos tomar foto de la comida comimos tan rápido!. END
BEGIN NOW    I can't possibly express how much I love Cosecha, or Swans Market Place as a matter of fact. END
BEGIN NOW     The market never disappoints, and I never had anything I didn't love at Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     We started with salsa and guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW     We could tell the salsa was fresh and made with heirloom tomatoes from the color of it. END
BEGIN NOW     The flavor of the salsa was vibrant and the guacamole was fresh and perfectly seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW     Then we had the fish taco and pork belly taco. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish was fresh, with nice and crispy flaky batter. END
BEGIN NOW      Pork belly was juicy on the inside and nicely charred on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW     And oh my god, the chocolate chip cookie! So good!. END
BEGIN NOW    The food may be ok but the organization and service are terrible. END
BEGIN NOW     The help is incompetent and indifferent. END
BEGIN NOW     Our most recent experience had them losing our order after we paid, and they didn't even have a record of it, and they hadn't given us a receipt. END
BEGIN NOW     After over 40 minutes of waiting for our order, and being repeatedly told, It's coming right up. END
BEGIN NOW     They conceded they hadn't placed our order and didn't even know what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW     We asked that they just give us what was available but that wasn't acceptable, so we would have to wait another 40 minutes to try again. END
BEGIN NOW     So about then we demanded our money back and left. END
BEGIN NOW     Previously we had asked a server to clean our table because it was cluttered and dirty from the previous diners. END
BEGIN NOW     One young man took part of their junk, didn't wipe the table and never came back. END
BEGIN NOW     We asked two more times before someone was willing to give us a clean table. END
BEGIN NOW    Blue plate fish tacos are a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW      Quality was fine, but you pay close to $13 for two tiny tacos that are smaller than an appetizer anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW      Chips and salsa are not even included. END
BEGIN NOW     I won't be coming here again. END
BEGIN NOW    I think they've done away with the $10 minimum on credit/debit cards? I came back here the other day with a major craving for their veggie torta, and they accepted my debit card. END
BEGIN NOW     Yay!. END
BEGIN NOW    Oakland is definitely up and coming and this market is apart of the gentrification process. END
BEGIN NOW      This place has a wine bar and they are installing some other restaurants to make it into a modern food court cooperative. END
BEGIN NOW      The lamb and beans were good, pork tacos were EXCELLENT (YOU MUST TRY) and the crab ceviche was ok. END
BEGIN NOW      The blood orange, pine nuts, and chicken salad was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the special hibiscus tequila cocktail and it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      I appreciate everything is made from scratch!The service is quick and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW      Erico was really nice, not to mention extremely cute and charming. END
BEGIN NOW      This place closes at 9:30 p. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW     Friday night so make sure you come early enough time to talk, eat and drink!  Parking was easy on 9th street. END
BEGIN NOW    Honest, solid, yummy Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     High quality meats really pack the punch in flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Generally not a huge pork belly fan, but the pork belly tacos were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The braised beef tacos I loved even more. END
BEGIN NOW     Quesadillas were outstanding! Thick, scrumptious cheeses and vegetables sandwiched between homemade, rich, flavorful tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     House made chips and guacamole really sealed the deal for me. END
BEGIN NOW     Do yourself a favor and have a Mexican mocha. END
BEGIN NOW     or two! Sooo good! Not a fan of sweet coffee? The horchata iced latte is delightful. END
BEGIN NOW     A must have to complete the Cosecha experience!. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been back to this place 2 weekends in a row now b/c right around Friday night at 7:30, I start dreaming about those cornmeal waffles that they only make on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW      $12 for a waffle isn't cheap (includes fruit + cream), but why budget your cravings?I've also had the Pozoles which is nice and spicy and good on a chilly cloudy day. END
BEGIN NOW     Have also enjoyed the shrimp tacos, the mushroom quesadillas and the pork tacos - all are decent (but not exceptionally better than what I might find at my local taco trucks), but the waffles - that's what I come here for. END
BEGIN NOW    Unfortunately, for my first try at Cosescha the chef must have been out for the day. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the special of the day, to-go after a long day. END
BEGIN NOW     I got home and excitedly opened my dinner only to be greeted by a sad, sad little flake of fish with only a wilted piece of lettuce and a few slices of peppers. END
BEGIN NOW     It actually prompted me to take my first yelp picture it was so pathetic. END
BEGIN NOW     To add insult to injury, I now have to go back out to grab a real dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     I should have checked the box so I could have rectified on the spot, but the reviews gave me the sense that I was in good hands. END
BEGIN NOW    The last time we ate here they weren't officially open for dinners and we got in by sending an email and getting into one of their community dinners. END
BEGIN NOW     We had a great meal and sat at a community table next to this really nice couple who were just starting their catering business while still working full time at their day jobs. END
BEGIN NOW      Fast forward to now. END
BEGIN NOW    their business has taken off (S+S Gastro Grub). END
BEGIN NOW    and we finally get a chance to use them for an upcoming company holiday party!  I tell this part because you can never underestimate the power of the community table in a town like Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    and Cosecha gave us a warm and fuzzy feeling from the very beginning. END
BEGIN NOW    Stopped in with daughter for a wonderful lunch today. END
BEGIN NOW      One bite of the yam quesadilla and I couldn't stop talking about it. END
BEGIN NOW      Just tasted so "real. END
BEGIN NOW    " The tortilla was flavorful and the whole thing didn't need the sauces that came with it on the side. END
BEGIN NOW     Daughter had the queso fundido and the pozole and liked them both. END
BEGIN NOW     We also had the horchata which was very good. END
BEGIN NOW    I timed it badly that I came on a Monday, because there are no seafood taco offerings on Mondays. END
BEGIN NOW     It would be nice to always have fish tacos on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    but maybe that's fine, as then I wouldn't have tried the yam quesadilla!  Lovely atmosphere and super friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     We'll be back sooner this time!. END
BEGIN NOW    Jackpot. END
BEGIN NOW      Blue Plate Special - fish tacos, with beans and avocado garnish. END
BEGIN NOW     Twelve bucks. END
BEGIN NOW      Superb. END
BEGIN NOW     Crisp, flaky fry outside and soft, luscious fish inside. END
BEGIN NOW     The beans were so savory. END
BEGIN NOW     This happening joint is in a big warehouse filled with other places doibg the same deal. END
BEGIN NOW     Large tables are available allowing people to meet and mingle. END
BEGIN NOW     Water is on all the tables. END
BEGIN NOW       So groovy!. END
BEGIN NOW    I wanted a meal, not an overpriced "quick snack. END
BEGIN NOW    " Two little shrimp tacos for fifteen bucks? No gracias. END
BEGIN NOW     It wasn't quick either. END
BEGIN NOW     Left annoyed and hungry--won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW    I came on a Thursday hoping to get my fish taco fix but was sadly disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW     How are two very small tacos with a side of plain ol' rice and black beans supposed to fill you up for $13? Topping the fish tacos were large pieces of jalapeño which overpowered what little fish I ate. END
BEGIN NOW     In addition we got an order of tortilla chips and salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips were extremely oily and the salsa came in a small container which we had to ask for a second filling because we were hungry still. END
BEGIN NOW     I do like the market but don't think I'll be ordering from here again. END
BEGIN NOW    Fancy, super hip, beautifully presented "Meso- American" twist on Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     Familiar and surprising at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW     Sangria was excellent!!! Pico de gallo was exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW     Located in middle of downtown with lots of access to drinks or dancing afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW     Portions are medium/small and prices are moderate/high- don't arrive starving. END
BEGIN NOW     Would definitely stop by again for a pre-drinks fancy snack. END
BEGIN NOW    Its pricey, but this place has the best food i have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially the pork in the pork belly tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Soo perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here a few times and am every time so impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     The ingredients are absolutely as fresh, seasonal, and creative as they claim, and the execution of flavors is clearly well-conceived. END
BEGIN NOW     This place would be easy to miss, so if you're in the area and love delicious, thoughtful, and bold Mexican food, don't miss Cosecha!. END
BEGIN NOW    Best zucchini tacos I ever ate!  Guacamole was amazing, too. END
BEGIN NOW    1. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to marry the chef2. END
BEGIN NOW     Best chocolate chip cookie outside of the ones my mom made when I was growing up. END
BEGIN NOW     3. END
BEGIN NOW     Get the corn - it will make you want to (see #1). END
BEGIN NOW    Amazing atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     In a busy area of Oakland you can find this precious food court that has a home feeling. END
BEGIN NOW     And Cosecha seriously serves you real Mexican food topped with elegant balance of flavors, also thanks to Dominica ( Chez Panisse for years ). END
BEGIN NOW    I was walking to my car after lunch and looked to see what Cosecha's daily special was and saw Mole Verde con Pollo. END
BEGIN NOW     There's always room for another taco right? $3. END
BEGIN NOW    97 including tax. END
BEGIN NOW    They've reduced the diameter of their handmade taco tortillas with the same amount of meats &amp; sauce making a much better balance between fillings &amp; tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     The taco comes topped with fresh white onions and pepitas (and usually cilantro yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/bGc4…). END
BEGIN NOW    Tender and moist (poached?) chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     The mole is lightly rich and mildly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW     They've had different moles for the Monday Chicken Mole special so call ahead, if you're looking for a specific type (Negro, Poblano, Verde, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    ). END
BEGIN NOW    Seriously? Don't knowI don't know what the big deal is. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Nicely deep fried fish sitting on a piece of lettuce, sitting on corn tortilla with some aioli dripped on it. END
BEGIN NOW     Unremarkable. END
BEGIN NOW     Chicken tacos less remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW     They did not have the quesadillas available (half the menu). END
BEGIN NOW        Horchata the sweetest I've ever tasted which, for me, not a plus. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered chips and salsa and got 10 stale chips and 1 tablespoon of salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     Go to the Tacos El Gordo taco truck on International in Oakland for much better food at 1/4 the price!. END
BEGIN NOW    Had the fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     They were decent but not worth the price. END
BEGIN NOW     Portions are small, service was disinterested at best. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool spot though, lots of potential. END
BEGIN NOW    Holy frijol, Cosecha is delicious!I usually find fancier Mexican food to be suspect, but hey, I don't see any taco trucks in Downtown Oakland, and Cosecha has rave reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     This hesitation was before I knew that they have butternut squash quesadillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Had I known I would have made like a jumping bean and come pronto. END
BEGIN NOW     This butternut squash quesadilla is amazing-and you have the option of adding meat or keeping it vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW     The carnivore prevailed and their delicious grilled chicken was added. END
BEGIN NOW     That Oaxacan cheese is a lipid lovers dream-so good. END
BEGIN NOW      Their tacos I had on my second visit didn't dazzle me, but not much would after trying my drug of choice, the bnsquash quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     I could definitely taste that the housemade tortilla and meats were quality, though. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the open air space, friendly service (the owner gave me a free oatmeal cookie hotouttadaoven), and boon to one of Oakland's most picturesque blocks. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll definitely be back to reap what Cosecha is sowing. END
BEGIN NOW    No stars the food was horrible. END
BEGIN NOW      The quesadillas were disgusting &amp; bland. END
BEGIN NOW      I tired to change my order they refused to give me another plate &amp; give me my money back. END
BEGIN NOW       She said that the shrimp was to expensive. END
BEGIN NOW      Never again will I come back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Rude rude rude. END
BEGIN NOW    Sometimes, I just have to scratch my head and wonder about people's taste. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, it's subjective. END
BEGIN NOW      But I can't for the life of me figure out why this restaurant gets such rave reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     Is there such a dearth of good Bay Area restaurants?  After seeing this on Check Please, Bay Area and realizing that this place was just around the block from my work, I was excited to try it. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the Blue Plate Special of crispy shrimp tacos and a cup of the pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos came with a side of pinto beans with small slices of avocado on top. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried shrimp inside the taco was extremely greasy, and the oil tasted stale. END
BEGIN NOW      There was absolutley no flavor in the shrimp taco unless you put the chipotle cream sauce on it. END
BEGIN NOW      The tortillas were homemade, fresh and declicious. END
BEGIN NOW      The pinto beans were bland and needed seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW      The pozole was good (served with fresh tortillas), but had way too much cabbage in it (it was basically cabbage with a little broth) and a few hominy kernels. END
BEGIN NOW      The taste of the broth was great, albeit a little too spicy for me (and I like hot). END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, I also had a chocolate chip cookie - which was tasty, but clearly just a Nestle Toll House cookie recipeOverall, I would not go back again. END
BEGIN NOW      I would rather have good, authentic street tacos from a taco truck then to have poorly done Mexican fusion. END
BEGIN NOW    Great for lunchCasual, airy spaceOrder at the counter and food arrives promptly at your tableChicken tacos are good. END
BEGIN NOW      Waitress thought we ordered the pork belly and she got super excited until we told her it was the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      So next time we'll have to try the pork belly and see what all the excitement was about. END
BEGIN NOW    Chips, salsa &amp; guacamole are also yummy as a filler. END
BEGIN NOW    Lunch special - two tacos &amp; agua fresca = $9Not a bad deal. END
BEGIN NOW    My bf and I thoroughly enjoyed our food at Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     We got the fresh tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole as well as the pozole. END
BEGIN NOW     The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful and we were happy with our selection. END
BEGIN NOW     The mimosas seemed to use fresh squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW      Five stars for the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Service-wise, there is room for improvement. END
BEGIN NOW     My bf and I both ordered pozole and his came out very nice, and mine looked very sloppy and missing the toppings that he got. END
BEGIN NOW     I value toppings more than he does, so I was very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      The waitress reluctantly offered to get me more toppings, but never returned. END
BEGIN NOW     My over-easy eggs also came out sunny side up and I had to request it to be corrected, luckily it came out fine. END
BEGIN NOW    Tacos here will cost you an arm and a leg but you are definitely paying for good quality products. END
BEGIN NOW     The pork belly tacos washed down with a horchata is highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW    Very good, very straightforward but surprisingly sophisticated Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     Think more a casual, "Frontera Grill" than a "Chevy's". END
BEGIN NOW     You will not find everything slathered in cheese to the point of being a formless blob, bathed in a sea of refried beans. END
BEGIN NOW     The spices are the main draw, and it's fresh and fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW    It's counter service, and there are some great and affordable Happy Hour specials. END
BEGIN NOW     There's also a super cute, kinda flirty guy at the counter, which doesn't hurt either. END
BEGIN NOW     ;)Definitely coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW    We were there for dinner last night. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is interesting: trendy food court of Swan's market. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything we had was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     We've tried the fish tacos (delicious), the pork belly tacos (amazing), grilled squash with corn and pumpkin-seed chile (awesome) and the mango-kumquat salad (mmmmmh). END
BEGIN NOW     Their drink and desert menu is on the short side but gosh, the food is good. END
BEGIN NOW    I've eaten at Cosecha twice, now, and this second dining experience has really confirmed for me that this place is committed to homey, artisan like food with seasonal and fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the Blue Plate Special- fish tacos with a huge, savory bowl of black beans. END
BEGIN NOW      The beans alone were so perfectly seasoned and warm and tender with a lovely gravy/like sauce -- almost a really thick black bean soup. END
BEGIN NOW    The fish tacos were composed of pieces of fried cod, a sour cream chipotle sauce, one slice of jalapeño, and some cabbage in a corn tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW      Beautifully fried fish that had a very delicate and light texture. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was super excellent and friendly and very respectful-- really top notch service. END
BEGIN NOW      Furthermore, the young man who served me recommended their house hot sauce-- which was bright with a great kick. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambience is of an open air market; very comfortable and pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW      I am so lucky this place is two blocks from my office, and it's just perfect for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW    I really like the ambiance of this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Well, depends, I would imagine you may run into the occasional individuals who think they own the place because of their privileged lives (but that's another story). END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered the fish tacos here (comes with black beans and rice) along with the Chips and Guac. END
BEGIN NOW      For the beverage, I got the horchata latte which is pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The fish tacos, beans, and rice were pretty good but for $13 bucks, I cannot say it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      I must say though that the chips, salsa, and guac were very very good and I would pay the same amount for that item. END
BEGIN NOW      My bill came out to be about $22 bucks. END
BEGIN NOW      Service: I would like to thank the employee who brought the food to the tables, and also took our dishes away later on. END
BEGIN NOW      Very nice and courteous. END
BEGIN NOW      5 stars for him!Would I come back?  Maybe under the right circumstances but would not go out of my way to. END
BEGIN NOW    Ok the huevos cuahutemoc are solid!. END
BEGIN NOW    Great authentic mexican food! Ran into this place, I had the quesadillas best ones I have ever had at a restaurant! Homemade fresh tortillas! I will be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was excellent, atmosphere is hip. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered the yam and cheese quesadilla for the little ones and they enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the pork mole. END
BEGIN NOW      It was extremely too spicy and the chef provided me with something less spicy that I could share with the kids. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha = Delicious beyond words I can't have enough type of food !!! Cosecha  is home to me :) I worked at Cosecha for lil over two years. END
BEGIN NOW     Even thoe I no longer work there I still come back to enjoy the food with out the work lol everything is so delicious full of flavor I could eat any plate but I must have to say my all time faves would be them shrimp tacos follow by some pork belly tacos it literally melt in your mouth and I can't forget about my mushroom quesadilla with pork. END
BEGIN NOW     If we talking brunch CHILAQUILES VERDES POR FAVOR !! but no matter what I get here it always need to come with a side of beens. END
BEGIN NOW     Those beans OMG I remember taking my lunch break and asking for a plate of beens with chicken, sour cream, pico de gallo, Guac and salsa verde sooo simple yet so amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     (To bad this is not a menu item :( sorry non workers of Cosecha) my now husband (boyfriend when I work at Cosecha ) LOVES them and he not a beens fan, for him me going to cosecha with out him is the end of the world. END
BEGIN NOW     He would be like "but you know I love cosecha " Indeed we do and not only do we love Cosecha but do we love even more its owner and chef Dominica with out her we wouldn't have Cosecha !! She's just amazing I don't know who is happier us when we go or her when she see us. END
BEGIN NOW     I would always go back to Cosecha no other food can compare. END
BEGIN NOW     I love recommending Cosecha because I know I would get that "OMG the food is amazing I can't wait to go back thank you " hahaha never fails. END
BEGIN NOW     I would deff bring my future kids for a kids quesadilla while sipping on a HORCHATA LATTLE I sure gone need that caffeine but it would be a treat as well :). END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is a really casual spot- you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp tacos were great, and the breakfast torta was hearty and delicious!Come early if you want the horchata latte- they were already out by 1:30 :( Well, come early in general. END
BEGIN NOW     They ran out of chips before we got there too. END
BEGIN NOW    Locally sourced ingredients with a focus on social justice. END
BEGIN NOW     She trained at Chez Panisse. END
BEGIN NOW     He's a professor at Cal State East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW     How could you not support this fabulous restaurant?!. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I grew up in Santa Ana and have traveled extensively throughout Mexico and Latin America and can say that the food here is quite authentic and definitely flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW    The green mole is fantastic and the handmade tortillas are a treat. END
BEGIN NOW     I highly recommend the queso fundido. END
BEGIN NOW    Great Mexican joint. END
BEGIN NOW     However, the portions are very small for a high price. END
BEGIN NOW     I would suggest the tortas, over the the tiny tacos ($3. END
BEGIN NOW    65) and pork belly tacos ($4. END
BEGIN NOW    50). END
BEGIN NOW     If you want good tacos for a reasonble price, head over to Mi Rancho taco truck on 1st ave and 14th street. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was good, can taste the quality. END
BEGIN NOW     Pricing for a shop like this was way off. END
BEGIN NOW     15 bucks for two tacos. END
BEGIN NOW    So let me start with what is good: the food is decent and the seating area is nice and good for large groups as you can order at the counter, share large tables, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     Staff are also kind. END
BEGIN NOW     That said, the PRICE IS BEYOND the far reaches of reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     $15 for two tiny tacos and a bunch of white rice (and no chips included) is totally incommensurate with the prices and portions of other high end counter-order taquerias in the area like picante or tacubaya, even accounting for the cost of special ingredients like shrimp, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    original review, September 2014 (update below):WOW. END
BEGIN NOW     I was expecting over-priced and small portions, after reading the gourmet menu -- But I got decent portions of gourmet served in sustainable to-go containers (no petroleum products, no plastic -- all recycled and compostable packages), for a reasonable price and very quickly. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered tacos and bean soup to go, on my way to an evening job. END
BEGIN NOW     It was served with a side of beans, rice and tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     I had enough for lunch the following day as well. END
BEGIN NOW     EVERY part of the order was outstanding -- The sauces, the garnish, the raw ingredients - all of the highest quality and absolutely delicious! Spicy enough to satisfy my preference for extra chili pepper. END
BEGIN NOW     I also appreciate the ambiance of the place -- I was expecting pretentious, but it's like an open cafeteria with several options and a communal eating area. END
BEGIN NOW     The server was quick and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be eating here regularly. END
BEGIN NOW      Genuine 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    ** UPDATE June 2015: I had to downgrade my initial 5-star rating to 4-star. END
BEGIN NOW     (See original review, above). END
BEGIN NOW     Unfortunately, the past several times I've visited Cosecha, the server has skimped on portions, with my containers of beans, rice, and guacamole only half-filled. END
BEGIN NOW     Come on, it's expensive enough with those little containers filled up. END
BEGIN NOW     I've noticed that I get more generous portions from certain servers, on certain days + times. END
BEGIN NOW     Less on others. END
BEGIN NOW     I wish it were consistent. END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    This place is overpriced for the food that you get. END
BEGIN NOW      Seems to follow the food truck trend. END
BEGIN NOW      Not recommended. END
BEGIN NOW    I give this spot a 4 due to service being slow. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered and waited for my drink for some time and funnily asked for it. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe the drink with meal is the norm. END
BEGIN NOW     The vibe is casual and cool but you will hit business lunches as well in full dress. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is a farm-to-table concept. END
BEGIN NOW     The tacos are tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     They use a single tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW     The braised beef has a dark, spiced sauce that was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The chicken had great flavor as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't expect a massive menu. END
BEGIN NOW    Last time I was here, their special wasn't actually a deal, it was just an item from the menu that was featured and written on a board, but it wasn't cheaper or 'on special' in any way. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered it, and it said it came with cornbread, but it did not. END
BEGIN NOW     I asked and they said they were out of cornbread, although they did not offer to supplement with something else. END
BEGIN NOW     Small portions for a high price. END
BEGIN NOW    A really nice and open location, with ample seating and a friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried the crispy tacos special, which came with 2 crispy pork tacos (there's also a vegetarian option), pinto beans, and avocado salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     The tacos were actually pieces of pork wrapped in thick, fried taco shells. END
BEGIN NOW     I was disappointed that there wasn't any filling like lettuce or tomatoes, but the avocado salsa was so delicious I was fine just dipping my tacos in that. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely a new experience and fun to eat! The beans were very tasty as well. END
BEGIN NOW    Came back on a few other occasions and tried the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp are HUGE (since they're wild caught) and super juicy/flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish tacos were a bit of a let-down. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel like the fish alone isn't flavorful enough to warrant a lack of fillings. END
BEGIN NOW     (All the fish tacos had were cabbage, sauce, and a sprig of cilantro) Overall, it's pretty pricy for the amount of food you get. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely not one of the cheapest options around, but I guess you need to pay for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW     And the wait during the lunch rush can be pretty long. END
BEGIN NOW    Had really good lunch here. END
BEGIN NOW    Prices are reasonable, but the atmosphere is very casual. END
BEGIN NOW     You order at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW    We shared the posole. END
BEGIN NOW     it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Lots of cilantro and it had some heat to it. END
BEGIN NOW     Might be too much for some people. END
BEGIN NOW    I had the crimini mushroom quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     It was perfectly grilled. END
BEGIN NOW     The salsa that came with it was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     And the guacamole was right on. END
BEGIN NOW     Right amount of spice and lime. END
BEGIN NOW    My SO's wild shrimp tacos were good. END
BEGIN NOW     Two fried shrimps in each taco. END
BEGIN NOW      But the side of beans was little bland. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh and we had a choc chip cookie, free for asking. END
BEGIN NOW     It was on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW    I would be definitely back. END
BEGIN NOW    When this place first opened I had the same complaints as some other reviewers here - high prices, small portions, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW      Here's the thing though:  This place has seriously upped its game over the past few months, to the point it is now cranking out some of the best food in the bay area. END
BEGIN NOW      No joke, this place is worth a special pilgrimage, especially on mole Monday. END
BEGIN NOW      The mole verde is just OUT OF THIS WORLD good. END
BEGIN NOW    I almost always get the blue plate special. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a reasonable sized portion and the food is just exquisite. END
BEGIN NOW      Sure it's a little pricier than most east bay tacquerias (more at an SF level), but the quality and sophistication of the food more than merit the (still very reasonable) price. END
BEGIN NOW      They make their own tortillas and all the ingredients are absolutely top notch. END
BEGIN NOW      The presentation is also really well done. END
BEGIN NOW    I like the set-up, too. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a particularly nice place to eat on a sunny day, with the open air feel and outside tables. END
BEGIN NOW    Finally, the service has gotten noticeably friendlier over the past few months. END
BEGIN NOW      A trend I hope will continue. END
BEGIN NOW    It was definitely time to upgrade my review to five stars. END
BEGIN NOW     I come here multiple times a week. END
BEGIN NOW     This is my neighborhood spot and I always feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     Love that the menu changes seasonally. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm not sure what happened to the people who got bad service because when I went the service was perfect and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I had dinner here on a Saturday night with my wife and we loved it, the location is great and historic the food was very good, fresh, great quality ingredients and good sized portions. END
BEGIN NOW    The homemade chips are fresh crispy and really tasty, the tortillas are handmade warm tender and awesome, the beans are really good overall just super good mexican food, I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW    I am excited to see restaurants taking a chance with mexican food and not doing the same old taqueria thing. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is decent. END
BEGIN NOW     Pricing of the tacos is a bit expensive. END
BEGIN NOW     The customer service could use improvement. END
BEGIN NOW     I will most likely not return due to the manner in which I was spoken to when I wanted modifications to my meal. END
BEGIN NOW    Love their shrimp taco and posole soup, love the food, love the ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW    Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW     Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW     And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW    I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW     But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW     And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW     I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW     Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW     I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW    There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW     With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW     Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW    If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW     The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW    As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW     Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW    On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW     I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW     They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW     :(. END
BEGIN NOW    I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW      There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW     But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW    JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW     He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW    The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW     from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW     Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW    Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW     No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW      The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW    What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW     Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW     We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW      Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW     I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW     The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW     The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW     Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW    This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW     BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW     His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW     I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW     Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW     I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW     Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW      Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW    Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW    I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW      Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW     The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW    So. END
BEGIN NOW     much. END
BEGIN NOW     whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW     They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW     They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW    It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW     Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW     It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW     What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW     The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW     I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW     Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW    This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW      Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW      Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW    00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW    This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW    Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW     It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW     The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW     Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW    a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW     space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW     you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW    on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW    Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW     Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW     For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW     But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW     And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW     Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW     Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW     The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW     Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW     Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW     Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW    The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW     There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW     I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW      The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW      Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW    The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW    I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW      Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW    Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW      This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW      You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW    Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW    PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW      Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW    I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW    Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW    Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW    My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW      We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW    The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW      That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW    However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW     i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW      So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW    But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW    One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW      She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW      Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW      Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW    To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW      But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW     They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW     However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW    To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW      And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW    They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW     In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW     Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW    This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW     Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW     You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW     If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW     Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW     He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW     We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW     He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW     "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW     The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW     Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW     Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW    At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW     Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW     Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW    Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW      And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW    I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW    My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW    " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW       Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW      On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW      My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW      "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW    ". END
BEGIN NOW    Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW    From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW    Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW    Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW     Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW    Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW     Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW      We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW    This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW     Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW     Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW     Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW    And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW     But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW     If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW    The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW     I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW     Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW     As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW     This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW     We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW    but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW     I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW    This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW     There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW     The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW     The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW     The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW     I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW     Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW     They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW    The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW     A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW    Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW     While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW     While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW     Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW      They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW    P. END
BEGIN NOW    S. END
BEGIN NOW     I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW    Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW    great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW    I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW     So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW     Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW     I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW     I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW     It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW     We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW      They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW     We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW    Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW     The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW     Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW      From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW      They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW      By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW      Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW      Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW     My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW     Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW     5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW    Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW     Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW     And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW    I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW     But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW     And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW     I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW     Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW     I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW    There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW     With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW     Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW    If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW     The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW    As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW     Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW    On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW     I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW     They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW     :(. END
BEGIN NOW    I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW      There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW     But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW    JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW     He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW    The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW     from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW     Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW    Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW     No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW      The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW    What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW     Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW     We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW      Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW    I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW     I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW     The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW    I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW     They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW     The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW     Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW    This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW     BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW     His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW     I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW     Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW     I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW     Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW      Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW    Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW    I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW      Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW     The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW    So. END
BEGIN NOW     much. END
BEGIN NOW     whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW     They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW     They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW    It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW     Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW     It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW     What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW     The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW     I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW     Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW    This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW      Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW      Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW    00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW    This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW    The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW    Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW    Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW    This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW     It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW     The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW     Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW    The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW    a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW     space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW     you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW    on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW    Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW     Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW     For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW     But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW     And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW     Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW     Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW     The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW     Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW     Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW     Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW    The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW     There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW     I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW     Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW      The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW      Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW    The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW    I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW      Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW    Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW      This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW      You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW    Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW    PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW      Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW    I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW    Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW    Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW    My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW      We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW    The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW      That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW    However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW     i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW      So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW    But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW    One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW      She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW      Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW      Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW    To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW      But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW     They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW     However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW    To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW      And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW    They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW     In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW     Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW    This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW     Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW     The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW     You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW     If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW     Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW     He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW     We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW     He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW     "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW     The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW     Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW     Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW    At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW     Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW     Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW     What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW    Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW      And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW    I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW    My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW    " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW       Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW      On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW      My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW      "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW    ". END
BEGIN NOW    Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW    From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW    Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW    Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW     Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW    Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW     Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW     Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW      We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW    Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW    This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW     Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW     Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW     Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW    And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW     But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW     If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW    Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW    The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW     I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW     Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW     As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW     This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW     We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW    but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW     I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW    but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW    This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW     There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW     The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW     The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW    Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW     The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW     I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW     Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW     They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW    The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW     A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW    Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW     While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW     While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW     Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW      They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW    P. END
BEGIN NOW    S. END
BEGIN NOW     I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW    Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW    great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW    I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW     So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW     Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW     I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW     I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW     It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW     We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW      They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW     We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW    Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW    Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW     The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW     This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW     Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW      From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW      They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW      By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW      Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW      Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW     My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW     Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW     5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW    Great dive bar with outdoor seating area - which is not a common thing in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     Simple, straightforward drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     As with all dive bars, the bathrooms are not that clean, but you know, deal with it. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, there was a not-totally-stable seeming lady who was yelling at women in the restroom to get out of the toilet faster. END
BEGIN NOW     The outdoor seating area is really nice with some full trees for shade during the afternoons. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, they seem cool with letting you bring in outside food and there is a cuban place, pizza place and burger place adjacent to the H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    I would give this place zero stars and the Abusive Bartender badge if I could, after witnessing some rather horrific and disturbing behavior from a male bartender on a female customer that was 100% unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW      Been going here for years, but after seeing that, never going back again. END
BEGIN NOW      Scary. END
BEGIN NOW    Don't go to this bar unless you wish to be attacked by a bartender. END
BEGIN NOW     One of the bartenders first ignored me, then when I asked for a beer, started screaming profanities at me and then actually put his hands on me and started pushing me around. END
BEGIN NOW     I can only imagine that if I had resisted him shoving me around, he would've quickly escalated to striking me, since none of this was provoked in any way. END
BEGIN NOW     I will never go back there again, even though I've been going there since they opened. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends are all boycotting this place because of this asshole, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Once a biker bar, now more hipster but the drinks are decent and the prices very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Only downside is everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh. END
BEGIN NOW     and cash only (although they have an atm)!. END
BEGIN NOW    The majority of the people at this bar have been nothing but gracious and courteous to me. END
BEGIN NOW     They've allowed me to bring in my dog, and it has been fine. END
BEGIN NOW     Tonight, a bartender on duty, someone that I had met on other visits, was in rare form. END
BEGIN NOW     He was discourteous. END
BEGIN NOW     He was argumentative. END
BEGIN NOW     He was mean. END
BEGIN NOW     I think he was belligerently drunk. END
BEGIN NOW     I have been a bartender and have managed bars and restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW     You can check my yelp history and how often I have written Yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     Almost never. END
BEGIN NOW     If interested, you can ask me which restaurants or bars I've managed. END
BEGIN NOW     This sucked writing down one of my own, and I've never written a negative review of another bar before. END
BEGIN NOW     It was simply the most offensively I've ever been treated in any bar or restaurant, ever, before or after working in the industry. END
BEGIN NOW    I stopped by for the Prince tribute last week. END
BEGIN NOW      Got there fairly early, just before 5pm. END
BEGIN NOW     The CASH ONLY sign at the bar was an unpleasant surprise, and the ATM in the bar is one of those I just don't trust. END
BEGIN NOW     Its connection seemed spotty too, as a number of people had issues with errors all in a row. END
BEGIN NOW      I ended up borrowing cash from a friend rather than risk it. END
BEGIN NOW     Decent crowd; not packed and not empty. END
BEGIN NOW      The backyard was actually the fuller part because the weather was nice. END
BEGIN NOW      My friends and I tried a couple of the drink specials which were Prince themed (either raspberry or purple, it seemed). END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing too incredible, but we enjoyed them nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a dive bar, not a cocktail lounge. END
BEGIN NOW      If you approach with that spirit, you'll have fun. END
BEGIN NOW    CASH ONLY (only downside, besides the parking meters which are ridiculously expensive). END
BEGIN NOW     $17 pitcher of Racer 5. END
BEGIN NOW     Great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll be back next time I'm in the area. END
BEGIN NOW    Two words: dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Personally, I'm a fan of the idea of dive bars. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean, who doesn't love cheap drinks? I know that I do. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially living in the Bay Area, anything that can keep some money in my pockets makes me pretty happy. END
BEGIN NOW    Cash. END
BEGIN NOW     Only. END
BEGIN NOW     Ouch. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not someone who carries cash. END
BEGIN NOW     That makes it so I drink less at places like this. END
BEGIN NOW     It also has limited space inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I tend to run cool, so I like to be inside which can be rough when it's busy. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a pool table which is frequently occupied. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm no pool shark but I enjoy putting my terrible physics and geometry skills to use. END
BEGIN NOW    especially under the influence. END
BEGIN NOW     It's always a good idea. END
BEGIN NOW    So three stars. END
BEGIN NOW     It's close and easy to get to but nothing super fancy or spectacular, over the top service. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a dive bar so yeah. END
BEGIN NOW    expect that. END
BEGIN NOW    Dive bars are more my style. END
BEGIN NOW      This spot has some real charm. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome outdoor patio and smoking lounge. END
BEGIN NOW     All sorts of characters, friendly fast bartenders, cool decor, and just that nice fun weirdo vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only!. END
BEGIN NOW    like yelp said "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW    I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    " I just don't feel safe or welcomed going into that place I will say the redeeming factor are the cute dogs just hanging out around their owners. END
BEGIN NOW    Jumped to my Top 5 favorite Bars I've ever been to. END
BEGIN NOW    Punk Bar with Pinball and great outside seating! Hell yeah! Service was good, prices were fair, and jukebox selection was On Point!. END
BEGIN NOW    This place seemed a little too much for my style when I first saw it from the outside (as it looks like your average hard core dive bar, often with motorcycle groups hanging around out front). END
BEGIN NOW     However I found it actually quite nice once I ventured inside. END
BEGIN NOW     The area I like best is the back patio, which has a nice beer garden feel. END
BEGIN NOW     I came here during the day but j can imagine it being a very poppin' place at night--it seems like a fun place to have drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Will come back again at night. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool place with a typical dive-bar vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only so be prepared - I almost wasn't! Outside was probably my favorite - a fair amount of seating, and they allow dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     The problem is that most dogs have owners, and some of those owners haven't trained their dog how to interact with other dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    Good drinks, bottled beer is probably the best bet. END
BEGIN NOW    it would be better with music at the Patio. END
BEGIN NOW    And gentrification is complete. END
BEGIN NOW      What used to be a laid back blues spot is now patronized by Hells Angels, never thought I  would see that at Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW      Gentrification : game, set, match. END
BEGIN NOW    It's good straight to the point bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I like to drink and they like to pour them, for a fee, of coarse. END
BEGIN NOW     It's my regular waterhole for the past 5 yrs or so. END
BEGIN NOW     They let you bring in outside food and it's one of the few places around that has a private patio to enjoy the nice weather and friends when the time calls for it. END
BEGIN NOW    Note: Be sure to hit an ATM because it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW    I love Heart and Dagger, yep it is a bar, but it is also the super sweet spot to shoot pool by my house, plus you can bring in your own food. END
BEGIN NOW    awesome! I came to the stairs in the front of the establishment and I looked up at them thinking, "Wow, how am I going to do this with one foot?"  The bouncer, Gary, was really cool, he helped get me up there so I could have fun inside with all the other bipeds. END
BEGIN NOW    lol. END
BEGIN NOW    There is always such a cool crowd at this place, no matter what you like. END
BEGIN NOW      The juke box offers some really great songs, the kind of songs that remind you of moments in your life that seemingly make you smile. END
BEGIN NOW      I think last night I heard an old "Wham" song that lifted my mood. END
BEGIN NOW     We watched a ton of Raider fans playing pool and basking in the glory of their win last night at the Battle of the Bay. END
BEGIN NOW      While the football game put my friend in a bad mood, the Raider fans were happy---let them have this little moment, it is not very often it happens ;)We attempted to go out to the patio in the back, and the ramp down into that area was yet another challenge for my one footed self. END
BEGIN NOW      But none to worry, there was a guy working at that back area too who helped me get around. END
BEGIN NOW      I have visited this spot for several years and have always had a memorable time--whether those memories be awesome, weird, annoying, ridiculous or fun, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    I always leave with a memory. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart and Dagger is always on the crawl list for birthdays, and pretty much the "stand by" for any night. END
BEGIN NOW      We can play pool or pinball, listen to music, watch pretty disturbing movies on the TV, hang out in the patio, or just sit inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I am sure to run into friends from the neighborhood at any drop in, so that is always cool when I am out solo. END
BEGIN NOW      Stephani Smiles for HND ;). END
BEGIN NOW    Great place to have a beer and chill. END
BEGIN NOW     The outdoor patio is fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd give it 5 stars, but occasionally the clientele can get a little. END
BEGIN NOW     roudy. END
BEGIN NOW     And not in a good way. END
BEGIN NOW    The un-dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to like this place, but the clientele is all highbrow now. END
BEGIN NOW     I never liked that it was cash only, but I still love the jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW     The last time I was there the skinny bearded doorman kept shouting across the bar to the bartender which was super annoying. END
BEGIN NOW     I was unimpressed with his need for attention. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe early in the day this place is better but when it's crowded, nah. END
BEGIN NOW     I was particularly amused by the weather-denying girl in the tank top showing off her tattoos as everyone else in the bar was in a coat and scarf because it was freezing outside and they had all of the doors open. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe in 1992 that would be impressive, but in 2016 you are one of many. END
BEGIN NOW     Put your coat on, sweety. END
BEGIN NOW     You'll catch your death. END
BEGIN NOW    Terrible bar with terrible staff. END
BEGIN NOW     Rude door people causing fights with new patrons, and that was before anyone had a chance to order a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     Not sure how a business with such terrible customer service stays in business. END
BEGIN NOW     I wouldn't come back here again if you paid me!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Let me just say, I've been here only a handful of times. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't come here enough. END
BEGIN NOW    It reminds me of some of my favorite dives when I lived in the City, just wish I lived within walking distance ;)Great roadhouse atmosphere inside, and a chill backyard area. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome place to come any day of week. END
BEGIN NOW     They pool tables and arcade games. END
BEGIN NOW     Cold beer on tab and bottled with a place to drink outside. END
BEGIN NOW     Mediocre pricing but they aren't shy on their pours. END
BEGIN NOW    This is my go to dive bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Super chill vibe, mostly locals, and cool kids. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a pool table, juke box and tables outside where you can bring the dogs, pizza and a board game. END
BEGIN NOW    what's not to like??Drinks are decent enough, I recommend sticking to beer, racer 5 on tap. END
BEGIN NOW    people seem to like the bloody Mary's and mimosa are perfect pre or post brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here late at night and have had a completely different experience than now. END
BEGIN NOW     Today, we arrived at the bar closer to sunset and hung out on the patio with my $3 beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance and other patrons were really mellow and enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cheap, so that is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender, however, seemed to enjoy taking out her life's disappointments on the customers. END
BEGIN NOW     I would've rather served myself. END
BEGIN NOW     It won't keep me from returning, just yet. END
BEGIN NOW    My favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     They play great rock and roll inside, and the beer garden is a fantastic place to spend an afternoon, or play cards late into the night. END
BEGIN NOW     There's tons of food in the neighborhood that you can bring in, and they're dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     The pool scene is competitive and the table is better than average for a 'dive' bar (which the Dagger barely qualifies as). END
BEGIN NOW     There's a great mix of people from East Bay Rats to local yuppies to SF expat hipsters and everyone gets along. END
BEGIN NOW     It gets crowded but not too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW    Just don't sit at the end of the bar by the men's bathroom -- you'll only smell urinal cakes all night. END
BEGIN NOW     Unless you're into that I guess. END
BEGIN NOW    All hail the Duke! It was by the gracious invitation of His Majesty himself that the girlfriend &amp; I came to Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     &amp; what a lovely Dukedom it is. END
BEGIN NOW    The Heart &amp; Dagger is sort of a dive bar, sort of. END
BEGIN NOW     It's too well-lit inside to really be a total dive. END
BEGIN NOW     It's divey in a hipster-ish kind of way. END
BEGIN NOW     But the hipster to real people ratio isn't too high, so it's still cool. END
BEGIN NOW    Full bar, impressive booze selection, nice cocktails, decent brews on tap, great Happy Hour deals, pinball/ video games &amp; pool table inside, dog-friendly patio out back, &amp; motorcycle parking right in front off the street. END
BEGIN NOW     It's all good. END
BEGIN NOW    We had a chill time time sipping a few drinks (but only a few, it's cash only here, I had loads of plastic but not a whole lotta green on me) &amp; watching Markus' reign of terror on the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW     Until, at last, he was narrowly defeated by a very pretty young lady. END
BEGIN NOW     Who says chivalry is dead?Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     I like it. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll have to return as often as possible to see the Duke, his fair Dukedom &amp; any other shenanigans afoot. END
BEGIN NOW    Made my way over to oakland to meet up some friends at this sweet lil spot. END
BEGIN NOW     Surrounded by plenty of parking and food it was a nice change up from SF. END
BEGIN NOW     It is a cash only bar some come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW     Full bar with some good beer on tap, and one dude holding down the fort on a saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     ( he was wicked fast). END
BEGIN NOW     Outside is a sweet lil patio for a awesome place to relax and chat( bench seating) and the fresh air was great. END
BEGIN NOW     The prices for drinks were right on, and no overly pricey with some good pours. END
BEGIN NOW    Cheap drinks, outdoor space, punk rock music -- YES. END
BEGIN NOW    You can smoke. END
BEGIN NOW     Here. END
BEGIN NOW     And drink. END
BEGIN NOW     A nice well whisky and a good pour. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     They check ID very professionally. END
BEGIN NOW     The people who work there are people, not hipster asshats or attitudinal testosteronies. END
BEGIN NOW     i like it, if you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW     Ahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW    I can see this place is going to be my favorite bar in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW    -Great bartender, totally personable and cool. END
BEGIN NOW    -Cool door guy, huge laugh!-Great patio, the likes of which are hard to find around here. END
BEGIN NOW    -Giant Lemons. END
BEGIN NOW    -Good mix of all types at the bar, everyone in a good mood. END
BEGIN NOW    -Drinks were reasonably priced and poured strong. END
BEGIN NOW    -It' close to my house. END
BEGIN NOW    Basically everything needed in a bar that's going to be seeing a lot of this face. END
BEGIN NOW    This place definitely has the dive bar feel to it. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm sure this is a good local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW      What really appeals to me about this places is the outside area in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      There are plenty of tables to sit at. END
BEGIN NOW      Great place to go with some friends to relax with a beer and chat. END
BEGIN NOW       Although it does get busy and filled up so no guarantee you will get a table. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a casual grungy type scene so jeans and causal attire is the standard. END
BEGIN NOW      I like the location and the vibe here though--super chill and relaxed. END
BEGIN NOW      There are a couple pool tables inside as well inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd definitely go back for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW    "Oh, he's very popular Ed. END
BEGIN NOW     The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. END
BEGIN NOW     They think he's a righteous dude. END
BEGIN NOW    "-- from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"A visit to Heart &amp; Dagger often reminds me of these words. END
BEGIN NOW     As watering holes go, it may not be for every body, but it has a strikingly wide array of fans. END
BEGIN NOW     And for us fans, it holds a piece of our hearts. END
BEGIN NOW     The vibe is casual (read: 'divey'), distinctly Oakland, with a wild undercurrent befitting a David Lynch film. END
BEGIN NOW     A biker bar only 'modestly' gentrified by neo-Oaklandites/wannabees/over-incomed geeks, to which I confess a partial complicity. END
BEGIN NOW      The playground segments into roughly three arenas:  (1) Bar area, where the bees get their honey -- and the barkeeps, both efficient and commanding, do a great job keeping the drones and workers happy. END
BEGIN NOW     Beer specials and shots of liquor are an excellent value, especially during HH, when my lovely Bulliet Manhattans are especially generous. END
BEGIN NOW     (2) Patio, definitely favored by the dog-partnered and smoking clientele, and seems to collect the more regular patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Gossip is overheard, smiles are witnessed, wafting cigarette smoke is inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW     Water from two giant ThermosTM coolers is free and easily accessed for both two and four-legged visitors back here. END
BEGIN NOW    And then there is (3), the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW      Where I learned, thanks to tutelage from billiards Maestro M and a few tips from other regulars, to now actually almost *not* suck at pool-playing. END
BEGIN NOW      Back to (3) in a bit. END
BEGIN NOW     For the bar en masse though: at its heart of gold though does push the tip of its dagger, as visits here have not always been a feel-good utopian experience. END
BEGIN NOW     I've seen people verbally insulted or kicked out for debatable reasons by the staff (actually mostly just one staff member, whose shifts are minimal); heard obnoxious comments by drunk and/or loud bigots; spied sketchy characters sporting knives in their back pocket, and witnessed a few "lively" disagreements over 8-ball. END
BEGIN NOW     Admittedly, H&amp;D is an onion with many layers, and not all those layers are pretty. END
BEGIN NOW      The trifling edginess is in reality as much an allure as a downer, and a metaphor and microcosm of our world and city and a reminder that good or bad you're still a part of it so why not be a positive part or at the very least learn how to deal with it? In reality, I don't wax all philosophic like that when I visit here. END
BEGIN NOW     Which brings us back to (3):  I do, truly, enjoy the regular pool players, and the competition and camaraderie I'm fortunate to have shared. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm a square peg for several reasons in H&amp;D, but the bonding with other such pegs or non-pegs is the reason I love to visit. END
BEGIN NOW     And on those visits, I get to practice my shot, nurse my bourbon, and inhale the simple sideways joys that life has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW    Can one sum up H&amp;D in a single catchphrase?  "All for one, one for all, just watch your wallet and drink. END
BEGIN NOW    " "You don't have to be a biker to come, but it don't hurt if you are one. END
BEGIN NOW    " "A bar of inimitable substance and a multitude of substances. END
BEGIN NOW    " Nah . END
BEGIN NOW     screw that. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger defies an easy Yelp review description. END
BEGIN NOW     And I'm guessing they like it that way. END
BEGIN NOW     Just be chill, be respectful, be unorthodox, be free, and be yourself. END
BEGIN NOW     It's not to be analyzed. END
BEGIN NOW     Just enjoyed. END
BEGIN NOW    If you like dive bars without the meth mouth, Sons of Anarchy watching patrons, Heart and Dagger will sit very well with you. END
BEGIN NOW     (It's kind of not really even a dive bar, shh)They *are* cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     There is an ATM with a $2. END
BEGIN NOW    25 fee, but you get that back fast because their drinks are so stinkin' cheap-- and strong!There is a pool table room and (the best part), an amazing outdoor patio that is friendly to your cigarette smoking buds. END
BEGIN NOW     It's kind of the perfect place to be on a summer night. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart &amp; Dagger is a solid go-to bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Come here once &amp; you'll likely become a regular. END
BEGIN NOW    one of my favorite places! cheap drinks, good people, a big back patio that is open late. END
BEGIN NOW     Home made beef jerky, aweful/good movies playing and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     also hosted by some of the best bartenders/doormen you'll meet. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, almost forgot. END
BEGIN NOW     they have three pinball machines (including walking dead) and a decent pooltable with a good/honest rotation of players. END
BEGIN NOW    Love heart and dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     My go to spot when I need a very laid back, wind down, kind of day. END
BEGIN NOW    I drink too much. END
BEGIN NOW      I came to that realization, drunk, during a disappointing pizza experience (why the fuck my bf drove us all the way to oakland for pizza who knows?)   What to do at 11pm on weeknight, drunk, concerned about how you will pay for Betty Ford and in Oakland?Heart and Dagger saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    Sure, my boyfriend tells me he loves pizza more than me. END
BEGIN NOW     Get me drink. END
BEGIN NOW    Thank the Lord in Heaven he volunteered to DD. END
BEGIN NOW    As Kevin B. END
BEGIN NOW     mentioned, if the Zeitgeist is too far of a hoof to get to, then H and D will do. END
BEGIN NOW      The back yard is pretty big and decked with communal tables for both large and small group outings. END
BEGIN NOW      We arrived armed with IDs out (although no one, but NO ONE in my party looked even remotely underage) and was met with friendly banter from the door man no. END
BEGIN NOW     1. END
BEGIN NOW      At one point I couldn't find my friends--not like the place is really that big, so I blame jet-lag for my confusion--and went back out onto the street to look for them. END
BEGIN NOW      Door man no. END
BEGIN NOW     2 had all the charm of a TSA agent upon my re-entry not 2 minutes later. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe he thought I was some a-hole ABC cop trying to pull a fast one on him?  I wish the US could just lighten up a bit on ID checking, but I get why they can't. END
BEGIN NOW      Anyway, this place is an interesting replacement for The Serenader, if, however, not in keeping with the vibe of that which existed for decades in this very spot. END
BEGIN NOW      -a place where bitchin' BBQ reigned in the backyard and my white face was a minority. END
BEGIN NOW    Great dive bar to drink at on a hot summer afternoon - The big back patio is usually bustling, but not too crowded to get a seat at a table (usually). END
BEGIN NOW      Good beer selection, good service, good prices. END
BEGIN NOW      Ive seen people set up picnics on the patio tables so it's pretty cool that they let you do that. END
BEGIN NOW     Great place to hang out. END
BEGIN NOW    Me likes. END
BEGIN NOW      Outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone has a dog. END
BEGIN NOW      Clean restrooms. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW      Good music. END
BEGIN NOW      Pool table and PIN BALL!  Don't try to bring chicken wings from Hot wings with bones. END
BEGIN NOW      Wilkie will not let you in. END
BEGIN NOW      The dogs are very important. END
BEGIN NOW    I was Chilling at the Slab when I get a Text from my Yelp Minister of Fun John Z to join the Posse at H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     So I jumped into my Whip Black Beauty and rolled to Oak town . END
BEGIN NOW     I grabbed a parking spot right across the street. END
BEGIN NOW      Tip 1 no parking lot just street parking. END
BEGIN NOW    So I roll in and see John Z and Markus dominating the Pool Table. END
BEGIN NOW     Anne Marie shooting Deer in the Arcade. END
BEGIN NOW     Home Sweet Home. END
BEGIN NOW     Yelp Posse in full effect. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice Big Bar ,Friendly Bartenders ,LCD TVs for Entertainment and a Cool Back Patio for Summer Nights or Days. END
BEGIN NOW    A wide selection of Beers and a cool retro Juke box adds to the Charm of H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    Great meeting Spot or a Friendly game of Pool H&amp;D is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW    Tip 2 They allow outside food in. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     2$ canned beer and really nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are looking to meet up with a group of friends this place has a really big patio with plenty of space. END
BEGIN NOW     Also it is cash only, so be ready for that. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved coming here and will be back. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a neat, inexpensive, kind of gnarly bar in downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely worth popping in! Don't mind the aggressive music and cool/weird stuff on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW    Value for Money: 4 StarsCustomer Service: 4 StarsAmbience: 2 Stars (markdown for hipsters!)Location: 4 Stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger Saloon appeals to my mysterious and cheap side. END
BEGIN NOW     everyday prices are cheap, HH is a bit cheaper. END
BEGIN NOW    lots of entertainment options: pool table, pinball machines, video machines, juke box, flat screens. END
BEGIN NOW     drink: gin &amp; tonic(4)-pretty strongguinness black lager(4)just so-soon draught:-happy hours(m-f, 4-7), $3 drafts, 3. END
BEGIN NOW    5 wells -voted by bar 2011,  east bay express-voted best jukebox in bar 2011, east bay express-patio seating in rear-free parking under freeway after 6. END
BEGIN NOW    -fast. END
BEGIN NOW     smiling service-prepared to be carded-pizza, burger, wing food options nearby. END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    -many patrons wear leather and tats. END
BEGIN NOW     clientele on the edge of heavy metal. END
BEGIN NOW    This bar has a genuine rock 'n' roll atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    Ah such a gem. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend took me here to play pool about a month ago and now I go about once a week. END
BEGIN NOW     There is usually rock music playing and something weird on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW     However, If there is a game on then it will be on the TVs. END
BEGIN NOW     They have pool and a couple of arcade games like pinball and buck hunter. END
BEGIN NOW     They have an awesome outside patio with a bunch of picnic tables. END
BEGIN NOW      You can take drinks outside and people can smoke out there too. END
BEGIN NOW    You can bring your dog! There are usually at least two dogs in the place which is so awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM. END
BEGIN NOW    No food, but there are food places next door and you can bring food in. END
BEGIN NOW     Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW    Well, my Yelp buddy Max has been going here for a while, and given that it's a six-minute walk from my house, I really have no excuse for not getting here sooner. END
BEGIN NOW     Anyway, I've seen the light! This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Pool tables are so rare here in NorCal! And a patio!And this place is right next to the parking are under the 580!. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent prices, nice patio when it's warm outside. END
BEGIN NOW    They allow dogs which is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW    Good spot to hang low. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a saloon. END
BEGIN NOW    My head hurts, and it has nothing to do with what I drank last night. END
BEGIN NOW      Water; I should start learning to drink more water. END
BEGIN NOW      But what's a poor girl to do when a bar insists on serving her most favourite whiskey at such amazing prices??Heart &amp; Dagger - For years, I'd walked by this place too afraid of my own shadow to venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW      Then one day, I came across a photo someone took of the outside and discovered that they kicked it up a few dozen notches on their curbside appeal. END
BEGIN NOW      Then, The C. END
BEGIN NOW     made me meet him here before showtime. END
BEGIN NOW      Who knew that it would become a small trend?I now can proudly say that I overcame my misguided fears and have found a sweet little spot on the ever changing face of Lakeshore Ave to call home. END
BEGIN NOW      This bar is perfect in its divey-ness, has a huge patio for perfect summer evenings, a nice little pool table that only costs $1 a game, and has an awesome jukebox that plays Flogging Molly and David Bowie!  Plus, the prices on the drinks are super inexpensive, and the bartenders are more than kindly souls that'll make you think of Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW    You, too, should overcome your fears and check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW      I feel myself lucky to have been introduced. END
BEGIN NOW    Always fun. END
BEGIN NOW    dive bar with a great crowd!!! Cash only FYI. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog friendly which is cool and outside private patio. END
BEGIN NOW    great place!!!. END
BEGIN NOW    This establishment is hateful. END
BEGIN NOW     I have never been treated so rudely. END
BEGIN NOW     I bought one drink and tried to take a picture on my 21st birthday and the customers and employees were malicious in a creepy way. END
BEGIN NOW     There was no wrong doing on my part, and yet my friend and I were assaulted by the bouncer and he tried to kick my friend. END
BEGIN NOW     All we wanted to do was take a picture which we were told was okay, but the customers sitting around the mural were egotistical. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead of the bouncer helping us get a picture he told us to take, he was on the side of the rude customer. END
BEGIN NOW     We just wanted to have a good time but that's obviously not possible there. END
BEGIN NOW     They were nothing but a bunch of creepy douche bags. END
BEGIN NOW     Good luck at this bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I would give this place 0 stars, if I could. END
BEGIN NOW    When Zeitgeist is just too far away. END
BEGIN NOW    The Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon wins on the name alone, but on a sunny day after a picnic on Lake Merritt, it's a great place to relax with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Like Zeitgeist across the bay, it's got a biker motif and strong beer on tap, along with a popular backyard for catching up with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     This place also has pool tables and a well-stocked jukebox (also like Zeitgeist), so it's better designed for long stays instead of a quick drink, and the crowd gets friendlier as the afternoon goes on. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're having a thirsty afternoon in the East Bay, quench here. END
BEGIN NOW    Sooo ran to Heart and Dagger for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     After a long day. END
BEGIN NOW     Stood there while the ex zz top member bartender serves about 5 people that came in after I did. END
BEGIN NOW     he finally notices my 6'5 dude . END
BEGIN NOW     And I "wave" to motion "over here" . END
BEGIN NOW     Since I'm paying. END
BEGIN NOW    He emulates my wave . END
BEGIN NOW    extra dramatic then begins to reprimand me tell me to never wave at him again or he will just ignore me . END
BEGIN NOW     I said well I just waved cause you asked the guy I'm with what he wanted and I'm buying sooo. END
BEGIN NOW    He said NO SERIOUSLY I DONT CARE. END
BEGIN NOW    I wish I had a drink in my hand so I could throw it on him. END
BEGIN NOW    FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW     And especially THAT BARTENDER . END
BEGIN NOW    I miss places where black people were allowed and treated with the same respect as the transplants . END
BEGIN NOW    He felt completely justified coming at the ONLY black couple in the bar like that. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe I'm sensitive but really FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW     May it burn to the ground and be resurrected as the serenader again . END
BEGIN NOW    One word for this establishment. END
BEGIN NOW     RACIST. END
BEGIN NOW     We are professional, well educated, LATINO couple in our 40's, born &amp; raised in SF and have lived in Lake Merritt for 10 years. END
BEGIN NOW     We decided to have a beer on a Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     The tattooed, black haired female bartender took our orders, delivered our beers. END
BEGIN NOW    then THREW OUR CHANGE at us, for no apparent reason. END
BEGIN NOW     Then the heavy set tattooed bartender says KICK ROCKS. END
BEGIN NOW     For those of you who are not familiar with this term. END
BEGIN NOW     Urban Dictionary definition: F*** OFF or GET OUTTA HERE. END
BEGIN NOW     Shocked and utterly disgusted people like this exist in OAKLAND? REALLY? Thought we were imaging this, but Nope. END
BEGIN NOW     Just read all the HIDDEN reviews, exactly the same. END
BEGIN NOW     Bottom line. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're brown or black. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW     THIS ESTABLISHMENT TREATS MINORITIES LIKE GARBAGE. END
BEGIN NOW    Still the most awesomest bar in town!Don't go with attitude and you won't get none, epic back patio and cheap drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     Better like friendly dogs, if not don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a super dog lovin' joint, if you fear them stay away and don't complain about them being there. END
BEGIN NOW    consider yourself warned. END
BEGIN NOW    Props to Suzy, Allison and Eric. END
BEGIN NOW    damn the whole crew over there makes my day. END
BEGIN NOW     Just pour me a strong drink, talk like a dirty sailor and I'm yours!A Quality, respectful stand up business. END
BEGIN NOW    all haters can walk the plank!!!xoxo!. END
BEGIN NOW    Great bar to play pool and just meet new people. END
BEGIN NOW     Very pet friendly and easy going great jukebox music and a spacious outdoor seating area. END
BEGIN NOW    pretty hipster bar a great improvement from the old bar it use to be. END
BEGIN NOW    She suggested we meet at this bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     I heard about it before and without context imagined it to be a seedy dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I arrived first and sat at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender was nice, the drinks were very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     My beer wasn't as cold as I would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd was definitely a varied mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW     I walked around, and checked out the back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Then decided, this is cool place. END
BEGIN NOW     My date showed up we had a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender randomly brought us a couple of free drinks to taste. END
BEGIN NOW     One thing led to another and we left together. END
BEGIN NOW     (It must have been the Funky Cold Medina)I would definitely like to come back and recommend this bar. END
BEGIN NOW    This is the only bar I like in my hood the bartenders actually remember who you are and always treat you friendly regardless of how busy they are. END
BEGIN NOW     The mixed drinks are always good and the beers is always nice and cold. END
BEGIN NOW      I always love when summer is around because it's fun to see what the guest keg will be. END
BEGIN NOW     The music is always great and the movies they play on the background are always entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice vibe and cool place to grab a beer and play a few games on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a giant outdoor patio with tons of tables in the back and lots of arcade games and a pool table inside. END
BEGIN NOW     It was kind of crowded when we went, so it took a while to find a seat and we didn't end up staying long enough to play pool but I would be down to come back and play a few rounds. END
BEGIN NOW    Enjoy being able to sit out back and enjoy the beers. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly staff is always a plus. END
BEGIN NOW    Soft opening tonight. END
BEGIN NOW      Big Daddy on draft. END
BEGIN NOW      Free Lanesplitter pizza. END
BEGIN NOW      Great friends and deep conversation. END
BEGIN NOW      If I didn't have a 10 month at home, I might find myself here MUCH more often. END
BEGIN NOW      Wish you were there Ben. END
BEGIN NOW     :(On the way out I saw local newsletter wordsmith Ken Katz. END
BEGIN NOW      He was enjoying a Negra Modelo and surveying the territory. END
BEGIN NOW      He asked me what I thought and said he looked forward to my Yelp review. END
BEGIN NOW      This one is for you Ken!  Keep up the good confabulation. END
BEGIN NOW      See you in the hood. END
BEGIN NOW    If you like Lucky 13 or Lost Weekend in Alameda, you will love Heart and Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW      Check 'er out!. END
BEGIN NOW    One star for every sip of beer before my dog and I got booted. END
BEGIN NOW    She was barking at another dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Which I get is annoying and cause for concern. END
BEGIN NOW     But she was only barking because she was leashed, and wanted to go greet the other dog. END
BEGIN NOW     And she was only leashed because within a minute of walking in I was told I had to leash her. END
BEGIN NOW     Which would have been fine and fair except that no other dogs were leashed. END
BEGIN NOW     Which puts my girl in a weird situation where everyone else is meeting and greeting and she's tied down in a corner. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence the barking. END
BEGIN NOW     I kind of wanted to point all this out at the time, but it's been my experience that nothing good comes from arguing with bouncers, so we left. END
BEGIN NOW     Which sucks! For the 3 minutes we were there it seemed like a cool little dive. END
BEGIN NOW     We live around the corner, and I was hoping this could be our end up after walks around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been there a few times and now I live a few blocks behind it so I'll be there a few times more. END
BEGIN NOW    Trumer and a burger from next door. END
BEGIN NOW    Kwik Way is theshit andthis place is lucky to be next door. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a fine bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Decent. END
BEGIN NOW    Dog central park today in the back. END
BEGIN NOW    But I got a burger and a beer,so nocomplaints. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is cool if you are a trite, predictable cliché of a hipster / fauxpunk. END
BEGIN NOW     If you like waiting 20 minutes for mediocre service and a can of PBR at 500% mark-up, please come on down to Heart and Dagger!Idiots are more than welcome to enjoy pretending at rebellion while leaning on broken, unusable pin ball machines. END
BEGIN NOW    Don't forget that we offer a special discount if you are one of those girls with no particular talent and so you take your clothing off on stage assuming that means you're a burlesque dancer. END
BEGIN NOW     Please hold your next "desperate for mom's attention" meeting here and get a free pitcher of horse piss! I mean Tecate!. END
BEGIN NOW    I used to like this place!  What the crap happened?  The bartender wasn't just rude, it was some whole other level of maximum hatred!  Did she think I was someone else?  Someone who had stolen her husband, killed her dog, and burned down her house?  Because that's what it felt like. END
BEGIN NOW      Damn. END
BEGIN NOW    After eventually getting a beer, we head over to play the pinball machines and they are in such a sorry state as to basically be a total ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart and Dagger, I can take a hint. END
BEGIN NOW      You don't want me to come there and spend my money, so I shant. END
BEGIN NOW    Okay, I admit I was only in here for 15 minutes, meeting friends before seeing a movie at the Grand Lake Theatre. END
BEGIN NOW      However, for a dive bar it's not really divey at all. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, it's dark and has pool tables. END
BEGIN NOW     But everyone is really nice and the place is clean and not skeazy. END
BEGIN NOW     Not only that but there's a great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     There's lots of bike parking out front and they don't mind if you lock up onto the railing either. END
BEGIN NOW     The bouncer didn't give me any grief about running in then out, parking my bike right next to the front door (I asked if it was okay) and then leaving again without actually getting a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely recommended as a nice neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks are inexpensive and stiff . END
BEGIN NOW    Cash only is a  bit irritating. END
BEGIN NOW    Only one toilet Plenty of seating outside . END
BEGIN NOW    I felt comfortable here and I think that it was because everyone was so friendly and engaging. END
BEGIN NOW     I should remember to visit that side of the lake for a more often especially if I'm in the mood for mustaches, boys who ride bikes , tattoos and a slick comb over, oh wait. END
BEGIN NOW    that is like. END
BEGIN NOW     all day , everyday. END
BEGIN NOW     Welp, alrighty then. END
BEGIN NOW    LOVE this bar!  It's charmingly divey, without being disgusting. END
BEGIN NOW    unlike this one bar I went to recently who's name I will not mention where patrons just dropped trou' and urinated all over the bloody patio - sorry, but that's just nasty. END
BEGIN NOW     I digress. END
BEGIN NOW     H&amp;D's bartenders are hella' friendly and they pour heavy. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, I can typically hold my booze pretty well and one $10 pint-glass-sized-long-island had me buzzing preeetty hard. END
BEGIN NOW      There's a pool table that's almost always occupied by friendly people who are happy to work you into the rotation, puppies! (yes, puppies. END
BEGIN NOW     It's dog-friendly), a nice outdoor patio for the smokers, tasty food just next door, a jukebox, arcade games, and an ATM machine (they don't take cards). END
BEGIN NOW      It's really nice to have this bar within walking distance of our house. END
BEGIN NOW      It's by far the best neighborhood bar I've experienced yet. END
BEGIN NOW    For saving my arse literally. END
BEGIN NOW     And having clean facilites. END
BEGIN NOW    I had  Trader's Joes and was loaded up with my bags when the urge hit to use the Bathroom like super bad like Damn I wish I had on a Diaper Bad like I might have to take a shit right here right now on the sidewalk and be on the bus hella shitty- like ( and deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW     I dropped my bags and rushed into the Bar praying it would be friendly and not you-gotta buy-to shit. END
BEGIN NOW     I was id checked ( I do look like a kid) and raced to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Praying no body else would have to come in cause the bathroom was super tiny with one stall and no way to pretend the stink wasn't emerging from me. END
BEGIN NOW    And there it goes a female patron enters just as I uh let go. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't help but smell that!-Sigh- Oh well I am grateful it went down this way and not on the bus (feeling deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW    Well made, quality drinks with a cool dive bar feel. END
BEGIN NOW     There's pinball and pool which makes it great for bro-nights. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons are stylish and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I really like the back patio area. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is very cool. END
BEGIN NOW      Great drinks and service. END
BEGIN NOW      Next time I hope to get a spot on the über-cool patio. END
BEGIN NOW      I can't remember the last time I had booze and played the video game Galaga (spelling?) Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    This used to be the go-to bar for my friends and fellow Bay Area Derby girls. END
BEGIN NOW     It was our hang out, we've given them a lot of business. END
BEGIN NOW     But then today after a beautiful sunny day and a skate around the lake we decided to stop in for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW     We looked on the outside for any sign about "no shoes, no service" but there wasn't one so we went in. END
BEGIN NOW     Two of us had shoes, I did not. END
BEGIN NOW     We proceeded to order our drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     We saw a cute dog sitting on a bar stool and gave it some love. END
BEGIN NOW     I got my beer and then a manager type abruptly told us we had to take our skates off, so we did. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends and I grabbed our drinks and headed to the beer garden in the back (me in my socks). END
BEGIN NOW     I took a few sips of my refreshing beer and Miss Cranky Pants told me that I must be wearing *shoes* or I have to leave. END
BEGIN NOW     I did not have shoes so I got my money back from my beer and left the premises. END
BEGIN NOW     It's too bad the woman was so prickly. END
BEGIN NOW     The woman could've been much friendlier and more professional in her approach towards us but she treated the three of us with such disdain that it left us confused and surprised about her behavior. END
BEGIN NOW     There was no sign posted about shoes in the front (only a sign about a 2 drink minimum). END
BEGIN NOW    they allow dogs in the establishment and they allow people to smoke pot AND there is no handicap access to the establishment. END
BEGIN NOW    but somehow stocking feet is not acceptable? Would they ban people in bare feet wearing flip-flops? The rules just seem a little off and we certainly didn't deserve the rude treatment. END
BEGIN NOW     Me, my friends, and the Bay Area Derby girls will not be returning to the Heart &amp; Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    Proud to say this is my neighborhood bar! Love the atmosphere, puppy dogs and staff!. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't usually review bars, but I loooooove Heart and Dagger! Beers are yummy, drinks are pretty good, but the best part is the patio. END
BEGIN NOW     People bring their dogs back there, it's awesome!We'll usually come here and chill in the patio, maybe play some pin ball, then move to the next bar. END
BEGIN NOW     We usually hit up Lanesplitter Pizza afterwords because it's so closeby. END
BEGIN NOW     Delish. END
BEGIN NOW    Bah! This bar has so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes! Go on a sunday and get mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW     Sit out in the patio, and enjoy your day. END
BEGIN NOW     then go wander to the lake and stare at the hobo geese eating cigarette butts. END
BEGIN NOW    Noooooo, don't go on a regular night. END
BEGIN NOW     the shape of the place is sooo weird and awkward, either you're in the way of the pool table or standing by a pole in the front, squeezed by the bar, or freezing in the back patio slowly absorbing lung cancer. END
BEGIN NOW     I asked for a gin and tonic and got soda and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW     talk about the most extreme of a buzz kill. END
BEGIN NOW      Soda is the hill billy cousin to city gal tonic. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, just because this bar is called Heart &amp; Dagger doesn't mean you get to be a mean jerk. END
BEGIN NOW    I repeat, get week-end day drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW    Cool, neighborhood-y bar with a lovely back patio area, a friendly staff and a great selection of beers and booze. END
BEGIN NOW    There's good affordable food nearby and the place is usually filled with friendly locals. END
BEGIN NOW    I dig it!. END
BEGIN NOW    So, my friend just moved to the bay area from good ol' NYC, and we decide to have a night out on the town, to welcome her to Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Granted, we're both tired and lame after a week of work, so a night out on the town ends up consisting of one drink then home. END
BEGIN NOW    HOWEVER. END
BEGIN NOW    My one drink was a super cheap aged Jameson, and hers was a super cheap PBR tallboy. END
BEGIN NOW      WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    We met my friend there whose pet pug (I'm sorry, he's a service dog, for real) is a regular at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, he sits on a bar stool. END
BEGIN NOW      WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    We headed out back where it was beautiful outside, despite being the end of October. END
BEGIN NOW      WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    On the back patio, my friend starts getting agitated. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't know why. END
BEGIN NOW      I realize it's because half the people here are not just smoking cigarettes, and where she's been living, that's still illegal. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean, technically, it is here too, but really: WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger is a great dive bar located near the historic Grand Lake Theater, conveniently nestled amongst other eateries and shops. END
BEGIN NOW    - easy going vibe- back patio- outside food friendly (you can bring your own)- dog friendly-  fun (pinball, pool table, juke box)- be sure to bring photo ID - i. END
BEGIN NOW    e. END
BEGIN NOW     license, passport. END
BEGIN NOW     State law requires that every patron have one (even if you look 21+) otherwise they get fined big time. END
BEGIN NOW    - cash only (ATM on the premises). END
BEGIN NOW    CASH ONLY! cool patio in the back and cool staff. END
BEGIN NOW     nice local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW     it's very low key and chill. END
BEGIN NOW     i'd go back if i was in the area and it was happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    Went on a whim after a friend recommed the place to me. END
BEGIN NOW    I had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     and too much to drink. END
BEGIN NOW    lol. END
BEGIN NOW     they ordered me a cab and someone offered to move my car for me since they had street sweeping early the next morning. END
BEGIN NOW    what a nice thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW    I would totally go back the vibe was pretty cool and the bartender was great. END
BEGIN NOW    biker looking guy with a goatee. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd like to give props but, I can't remember his name. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW    Well, this was a fun night!  A little dive-y, dark, and grungy, but I live down the street and have always wanted to see inside!  I ended up getting a mimosa for 4$ (I think. END
BEGIN NOW    ) which was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      The back patio is pretty cool, but I couldn't stay long because it was beyond freezing the night I went. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, do you think it might be a good idea to put lights outside?  Or, more lights outside?  I mean, its cool and all to sit and drink in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW     but more fun to see the person you came with!  I really prefer the two seater RIGHT by the windows inside by the bar- so quaint and cozy!I read they once had a mechanical bull. END
BEGIN NOW     am I wrong?  If they did, crowds would multiply, and I would be there every Sat!. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent place, but the bartender could certainly have been less of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW    What other bar would explicitly say on their website that their mission is to have cheap drinks with no cover?Hey, Yelp stalkers (that are dwindling in numbers every day)! Want to stalk for reals? I'm here every Friday without fail because this bar is so freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     Though it's not on the ridiculously cheap Happy Hour special list ($3 drafts and well drinks), their Dirty Martinis are some of the best I've ever had (still at a super cheap price!). END
BEGIN NOW    Do yourself a favor and get there early to snag a seat on the outdoor patio under the lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW     The Heart and Dagger has friendly service (I need not mention their predecessors), friendly patrons, and an all together relaxed and fun vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only, and watch out. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll probably steal your seat on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW    Eek! Methinks not. END
BEGIN NOW    That's exactly how I feel about this place, and the bartender helped out with that feeling. END
BEGIN NOW      By the way this is no Zeitgeist!  That's like calling Taco Bell authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW      Anyway. END
BEGIN NOW    Me and my lady walked in Sunday late evening around 7ish not packed but there was people. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought the layout was nice, games are cool, and yes the Jukebox is the God of Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW      Trust me if it weren't for that jukebox they might have got 1 star. END
BEGIN NOW      Ordered tequila with club soda and a bloody mary for the first round. END
BEGIN NOW      Hmmm I've had better and I wasn't feeling the bartenders dry attitude. END
BEGIN NOW      It's not like I wanted her to do cart wheels but damn girl smile at least. END
BEGIN NOW      We stepped outside to feel the vibe out there since there wasn't much of a vibe at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Beautiful lemon tree, plenty of awkward seating, and a big bummer is you can't hear the music outside. END
BEGIN NOW      We decided one more drink and depending on the bartenders attitude we would decide if we where going to stay or leave. END
BEGIN NOW    Shot of Fernet please and one more tequila with club soda. END
BEGIN NOW      I received what seemed like half a shot for 6 bucks and a half ass thanks. END
BEGIN NOW      The guy next to me ordered a shot of Fernet too and it was beyond obvious his shot was double what was in my glass. END
BEGIN NOW      Whatevs I finished my shot and left. END
BEGIN NOW      You guys can all have this place cause it ain't fulfilling my drunk lover needs. END
BEGIN NOW    From the outside, it looks like someone simply converted their quaint little house into a public bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Inside is a bit more rock n roll, loud music and pool. END
BEGIN NOW     $2 PBR tallies make pretty much any hole in the wall a worthwhile stop for a drink or two. END
BEGIN NOW     The back patio is perfect for a summer evening but gets crowded fast as most of the room out there is taken by tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog friendly despite not having the friendliest of dogs. END
BEGIN NOW    You know what I like? Booze. END
BEGIN NOW     You know what else I like? A bar that will give me said booze at a price that won't break my wallet (Ummmm, hello? Uptown? Your $8. END
BEGIN NOW    00 Maker's shot can eat a bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW    )This place is totally going to hit five stars soon. END
BEGIN NOW     There are still a lot of small details that are getting worked out but you know what? The owners are hands on and working on them. END
BEGIN NOW     I see them there almost every single night greeting people, talking to them about improvements. END
BEGIN NOW     hell, I even saw one of them leave their guests they had come in with to help one of their bartenders who had gotten slammed and lost in the weeds. END
BEGIN NOW    I've read the accusations of this place being racist and I just don't know what the hell you people are talking about. END
BEGIN NOW     I can go on about it but giving it any more space than two sentences is giving credence to a line of bullshit that is just reDONKulous. END
BEGIN NOW     There are few places in Oakland that I've found that allow me to feel comfortable with a wide array of friends. END
BEGIN NOW     I can have this as my place to start the night, spend the night, or end the night. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh - did I mention that Lanesplitters usually drops off pizza when they close? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     free drunk food. END
BEGIN NOW     All you one-star givers can join to Uptown on eating their bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW    I knew I would like this place when this was on the juke box while I entered youtube. END
BEGIN NOW    com/watch?v=BIvk… There was once a time when this place was the Serenader and that place scared the daylights out of me. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons would shout at me when I walked past and I figured that heckling/intimidating patrons with the potential to scare off customers and I totally wrote about it on Yelp and it was #$%&amp;ING FLAGGED AND REMOVED because I violated TOS. END
BEGIN NOW     Well, ha, it took two years for them to pull it. END
BEGIN NOW     And, well, ha, MICHELLE S. END
BEGIN NOW     WILL NOT BE SILENCED! HAHAHAHA!Sorry. END
BEGIN NOW    Anyway, some time ago, I reviewed Zietgiest and was so pissed that the patios seemed to be in SF rather than in the warmer climate of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    Guess what! Enter Heart and Dagger Saloon! I finally stumbled in to check this place out yesterday afternoon (they open at noon or 1 pm on the weekends) and it was a very great anti-brunch and anti-farmer's market thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons are very talkative and approachable. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is super friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW     They have an impressive bourbon collection and two types of sangria. END
BEGIN NOW     And, most importantly, a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW    Now if the Oakland Tamale guy would stop doing the Telegraph bars and come here instead. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     The name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW     The best thing about this bar is they have cheap drinks and they have a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not a fan of going to bars where you can bring dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm from the super duper old school. END
BEGIN NOW     Dogs should stay their little furry butts at home. END
BEGIN NOW     As soon as i walked my fly butt out side to find a seat. END
BEGIN NOW     The most ugliest poodle walked up to me and started liking my leg. END
BEGIN NOW     This dog was going in for the kill, his nose was going further up my dress. END
BEGIN NOW     I literally started screaming and telling the dog to get the hell away from me. END
BEGIN NOW     OK i think yawl get the hint I'm not a dog lover. END
BEGIN NOW     Now don't get me wrong I like dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Bottom line Heart and Dagger the name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW     Please don't spend to much of your life at this bar unless you rock outfits that have skull and bones on them. END
BEGIN NOW     Get my drift. END
BEGIN NOW    3 terrific pinball gamesAttack from Mars (Bally)Creature from the Black Lagoon (Bally)Arabian Nights (Williams)$3. END
BEGIN NOW    50 PBR TallboysDecent jukebox (no autotunes)Mellow people (seemed free of hipsters. END
BEGIN NOW    ). END
BEGIN NOW    I have never been treated so rudely by a bartender (and we all know how they can be sometimes, lol). END
BEGIN NOW     But imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the self-proclaimed OWNER of the place. END
BEGIN NOW     I am still just shocked by her blatant disrespect of my friends and I, I still have absolutely no idea why we were treated in this fashion-- the only cause i could speculate is that I was with mostly people of color. END
BEGIN NOW     shocking for Oakland, but i have racked my brain and that is the only thing i can come up with. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender did not want us there from the second we walked in and she made that very clear. END
BEGIN NOW     Nor did she even care when I tried to address the matter with her, happy to hear she had lost all of our business forever. END
BEGIN NOW     I see that a few other reviewers had similar experiences, how sad. END
BEGIN NOW    All's I know is that I know a LOT of bars in Oakland that at least pretend to care about their customers. END
BEGIN NOW     I will never go back to this bar, it's certainly no good to be so blatantly disrespected, but I'm certainly not going to PAY to be treated that way. END
BEGIN NOW     lol. END
BEGIN NOW    I just moved to Lakeshore from Montclair, and you know what excites me?  The fact that I can walk to a bar and stumble home late at night after. END
BEGIN NOW      You know what doesn't excite me?  The fact that Heart and Dagger Saloon of Oakland is my local bar. END
BEGIN NOW    Let's be honest, I haven't seen this many white people together in one place since Oakland's First Friday (or as I lovingly call it, "White Night"). END
BEGIN NOW      The lay out is funky . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     especially the VIP raised table right as you walk in the door. END
BEGIN NOW      The outside is nice and I will definitely try it again in the summertime, but really, I don't want to go anywhere that makes my "ethnic" friends feel uncomfortable . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    Looks like we're going to Easy. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger is a-okay. END
BEGIN NOW     The patio is gigantic, probably more room out there than in the actual bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices were reasonable, but comparisons to Lucky 13 or similar bars with awesome beer selections and divey vibes are a bit uncalled for; there aren't that many beers on tap, and the crowd there (Saturday afternoon) was more likely to be reading the paper than to be chatting it up with fellow bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog friendly though!. END
BEGIN NOW    i dunno what i was expecting when i heard this was a biker dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    maybe a little more dive and a little more hott bikers. END
BEGIN NOW    ? parking was easy, directly across the street. END
BEGIN NOW    and well, the spot itself is pretty cool inside with pool tables, pinball machines, and a jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender worked up some strong drinks and the other patrons were pretty accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW    the patio area was pretty big lined up with park benches to share, but the lighting def needs improving so us cougs could see which cubs are available to hunt! some of my biker friends rave about this spot because of it being biker friendly and maybe it just wasn't the night for them to be there. END
BEGIN NOW    so i'll be back and give it another try, maybe on a saturday. END
BEGIN NOW    check back and i'll let you know!. END
BEGIN NOW    Walked in here for the first time and was like "so THIS is what the Serenader looks like from the inside!"Great out door patio, stiff cheap drinks, good jukebox, men with facial hair . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     sign me up!. END
BEGIN NOW    Where everybody knows your name!We have been going to the Heart and Dagger since it opened, usually with me draped in my cool H and D swag. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a throwback to a great neighborhood bar, with a little punk thrown in. END
BEGIN NOW     We went last night to reintroduce our recently transplanted friends back to the amazing-ness that is the Bay Area, and ran into a group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW     That is what I love about this place! Knowing that our friends all go there, and that we can catch up and hang out on the patio for hours is awesome!Boozy Suzy always makes me a delicious custom made drink when I am hanging out with all of the beer drinking boys, which puts a smile on my face every time. END
BEGIN NOW    The boys love getting Lane-Splitters for dinner, and staying and talking the night away. END
BEGIN NOW     Now, if I can only get Lane Splitters to carry gluten free pizza, I would never leave!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are looking for a dive bar, you can't do much better than this in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks are cheap, there's a great outdoor seating area and plenty of people watching. END
BEGIN NOW     It gets a little smokey in the patio, but what do you expect from outdoor seating at a bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Pinball and Pool are also big pluses. END
BEGIN NOW    Love the fact that karaoke is not and never will be allowed!They pour great drinks with great prices and a very fun crowd to watch. END
BEGIN NOW    Check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW    I love, love love love Heart and Dagger! It's about time that Oakland got a decent rocker/biker/alternative bar!I've heard people call it a "dive bar" but it's anything but. END
BEGIN NOW     If you love Zeitgeist in SF, imagine a smaller, east bay version. END
BEGIN NOW     That's what you get at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW    Plus, you can actually go and get a few drinks and not spend more than $20. END
BEGIN NOW     The jukebox is loaded with bitchin' tunes. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     The place is Dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     And they let you bring in food from other places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     And once in a while, Lane Splitters will bring by free pizza that's left over at the end of the night or wrong orders. END
BEGIN NOW    It's cozy and comfy. END
BEGIN NOW     All races, genders, gays, straights welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     It's nice to see a diverse alternative culture and not feel like you walked into a snobby hipster bar for once. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger has certainly become my version of "Cheers!". END
BEGIN NOW    I dig this bar, I really do. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is friendly (even the door guys are nice) and there's usually a fun crowd inside. END
BEGIN NOW     My favorite time to visit Heart and Dagger is on a lazy Sunday when the back patio is filled with dogs, cigarettes and tall boys. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinks are reasonably priced, has every amenity you'd ever ask of a dive, and the bathrooms aren't gross! I can only speak for the Men's bathroom, though. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, if you're hungry, Lanesplitters (as well as other awesome grub) is right next to Heart and Dagger, and the bar is totally cool with you bringing a pizza box in to share with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    Additional bonuses: 3 pinball tables and an ATM machine. END
BEGIN NOW     When their ATM machine isn't working, there's a bank 50 feet away. END
BEGIN NOW     The only negative: When the outside patio is closed and the bar is packed, the inside of the bar will make you claustrophobic. END
BEGIN NOW    If I've said it once, I've said it a million times:  This place is great as long as the back yard stays open. END
BEGIN NOW      When they shut it down and start hustling us in at 11 or 11:30 or whenever it is, it is just way too small to accommodate us. END
BEGIN NOW      Inevitably this results in an additional trip either back to the Kona or the Ruby Room. END
BEGIN NOW    I know they're trying to be good neighbors and I can respect that, but the early nightly closing of the outside is a total buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW    While my pals and I were wandering around Oakland on a sunny day, we came here to get a drink and sit at their outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a bit of a 30-something meat market. END
BEGIN NOW      Since we were not really out on the prowl, it was a sort of hilarious scene. END
BEGIN NOW      We drank mimosas and watched a group of British men hit on any women who'd have them. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't know about what it's like at night or when it's cold, but I found it quite enjoyable in the lovely Oakland sun. END
BEGIN NOW      Not really worth a trip to the East Bay, but good if you're already there. END
BEGIN NOW    3. END
BEGIN NOW    5 stars!It gets knocked back from 4 because the only beer I (kinda) like there is Sierra Nevada. END
BEGIN NOW      But this is a great last stop for when you don't care anymore and you just want to knock back a PBR tallboy or two. END
BEGIN NOW     Classy!   Anywaaaays, it may not be the classiest joint but it is a lot of fun -- there are little video games, a pool table, and a large outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      The TVs play the randomest crap, and everyone there is just chillin'. END
BEGIN NOW      Gets a little crowded, but that's part of the fun. END
BEGIN NOW     And when you finally get kicked out, the Taco Guys sometimes park their truck outside, so you can grab an organic, free-range, vegetarian-fed taco (it's very important for your 2 a. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW     drunk self to be environmentally friendly) to go with that last PBR. END
BEGIN NOW    Pitchers, pinball, patio! Great neighborhood dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     good location, average prices, dogs outside. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely plan on going back regularly. END
BEGIN NOW    This is now the bar I call my neighborhood favorite. END
BEGIN NOW      I love that it has an outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      The one downside is that I'm a nonsmoker so if it's crowded it's hard to get away from the smokers but it's worth it to me to sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy a beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The beers are priced great, especially if you get there early enough for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW      Dogs are allowed in the back which offers some entertainment if there are a few there. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders have always been very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I haven't been back in a while since the weather has been cold but the next warm, sunny day I have off work I know where I'm headed. END
BEGIN NOW    If the Lexington in SF and Zeitgeist in SF had a love child it would be Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     In recent years there has been a gaggle of gays moving over to Oakland, myself included, and we needed a gayborhoody hangout. END
BEGIN NOW     I do believe Heart and Dagger fits the bill! A group of us went to Heart and Dagger and we knew we were "home" when Gary, any dyke worth her weight knows this doorman, greeted us! There were hugs all around! He has been working the door at some infamous lesbian parties in SF for years. END
BEGIN NOW     He is an East Bay boy so he is right at home at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar has that "cozy" Lex feeling and the backyard is like Zeigeist's little sister. END
BEGIN NOW     There is also a pool table indoors and it's surrounded by tons of raggedy old bar stools and a couple throne type areas to chill in. END
BEGIN NOW     Random, but welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW     Good, full bar with some attractive bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     Always a bonus! Prices were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     And don't worry hip straighties, it is a diverse crowd and everyone seems to be welcomed with open arms. END

BEGIN NOW     Its smaller than you expect but the folks tend to be friendly and loud. END

BEGIN NOW    Bar tender was friendly &amp; helpful with beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW    Mixed crowd on my visit. END
BEGIN NOW    Parking was no big deal (right across the steet. END
BEGIN NOW    A big improvement from the last sh*#hole bar previously residing @ this location. END
BEGIN NOW    Patio looks to be a good spot for hot summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW    Go already!!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved the pinball and the backyard seating! Cash only so come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW     Great spot for a bloody mary on a Sunday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW     Bring your pooch along!. END
BEGIN NOW    When this place first opened up, I thought it was pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW      I loved the pinball, back patio &amp; the jukebox was pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW      However, over the last year I've gone there, my impression declined from "great" to "okay" to "absolutely never again will I set foot in the place". END
BEGIN NOW      The first reason I started going was for the pinball, but whatever company leases the machines to the bar (California Amusement Group?) does not keep them in good repair. END
BEGIN NOW      Since they opened, I've been there to play the machines multiple times, and each time, every single one of the 3 games were in such disrepair as to make the game almost a complete waste of money because you couldn't make key shots for scoring (like an intermittent or weak flipper, or a semi-functioning plunger). END
BEGIN NOW      Eventually, I stopped going there as often because of that, but gave it another chance a couple nights ago because my friend's friend was having a birthday party there - BIG mistake. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend (also female) and I waited at the bar to get a drink for over 20 minutes while the bartender completely ignored us, giving no eye contact &amp; no acknowledgement that she saw us, while serving everyone else at the bar, including people who had clearly come up to the bar after us. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm pretty patient when a bar is crowded, because I understand that it's not an easy job. END
BEGIN NOW      However, as we got passed over, time &amp; time again, it was obvious that the bartender just did not want to serve us. END
BEGIN NOW      WTF?  There was even some jerk standing fully behind me who leaned over my shoulder &amp; shouted - "pitcher of Trumer" - who got served while we were still waiting there!  Finally, there was guy standing next to my friend who could see what was going on (who had also come up AFTER us), and then sure as sh*t, the bartender came up to ask HIM what he wanted, so he pointed to us and said "these ladies were first", and she scoffed &amp; said something totally dismissive like "okay whatever" and then reluctantly asked what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW      After she served us, she started ignoring the guy who pointed out that we were next. END
BEGIN NOW      Okayyyyy - wow. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not sure why we got that kind of treatment, but it felt pretty crappy. END
BEGIN NOW      I sortof wondered whether it was because I was an obvious dyke. END
BEGIN NOW      I couldn't think of any other reason why we got treated that way, unless maybe the bartender just has a problem with other women in general?  (I've seen other reviews by women here who have mentioned crappy treatment by a female bartender here as well). END
BEGIN NOW      In any case, regardless of the reason, this bartender obviously did not want me &amp; my friend's business, and the owners don't care that their patrons get ripped off on their janky pinball machines either, so Mission Accomplished!!!  I will never go there again!Sad, because it had so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW    My favorite neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cozy. END
BEGIN NOW     The patrons are young, diverse, attractive, and take good care of themselves. END
BEGIN NOW     The bar staff and security are really friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice change from comparable larger venues in the City. END
BEGIN NOW     This is where I plan to bring my friends this summer. END
BEGIN NOW    The music hits all my sweet spots--blues, rockabilly, punk, HEAVY METAL. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is good enough for me--and it's cheap! And if I overkill (which I almost never do anymore) I live right up the street and could crawl home if necessary. END
BEGIN NOW     Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     If grog and whiskey ain't your thing, then be sure to ask for a Suzie-kazi if Boozie Suzie is slingin shots. END
BEGIN NOW    Need something to pad the sauce so you can see straight despite beer goggles? Head over to Lanesplitter's right next door--OR DRINK SOME MORE UNTIL YOU'VE DRUNK YOURSELF SOBER. END
BEGIN NOW    I thought this place was cute. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks were great and super cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     We went on a Friday night around 9 and it was packed. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought the outdoor space was great. END
BEGIN NOW     It had cute brick/cobble stone floor, lots of stringed lights and the cutes local puppy. END
BEGIN NOW     I will say that the layout is ridiculous, they could have fit way more tables or at least some drink holding counters. END
BEGIN NOW     i spent most the night reorganizing the space layout in my head. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd seemed a little young, college- single types, but everyone was friendly and calm-ish. END
BEGIN NOW     However it was only 9 and the party was just beginning. END
BEGIN NOW    they have pool table and pin-ball but they were packed and unlikely to be able to play. END
BEGIN NOW    All-n-all: i would go back for a beer and hang. END
BEGIN NOW     but after we left here, we stumbled upon all that is holey in Dive Bars. END
BEGIN NOW      Smitty's Cocktails, review to follow!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Heart and Dagger is my neighborhood  bar hangout. END
BEGIN NOW     For those in the Grand Lake area, it really is convenient which adds to it's draw. END
BEGIN NOW     It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     It has a cool motorcycle vibe and some tough looking characters that frequent. END
BEGIN NOW     While it has some diversity of character, however, it really is a hipster-ific bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Lanesplitters, the next door pizza joint, will often deliver the pizza at the end of the night. END
BEGIN NOW     GREAT outdoor patio with a fun lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW     In three words: cheap, convenient and cool. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything I want in a bar: cheap drinks, comfortable back yard to sit and drink in (complete with a huge lemon tree in the center), good jukebox, decent not-to-cool-for-school bartenders, a first person shooter video game, and a non-douchey clientele. END
BEGIN NOW    I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW    Can you say cheap drinks? Well, I use to pop up at this place before Heart and Dagger took over. END
BEGIN NOW     The mgmt kept changing and it wasn't always safe to go, but they had great bands. END
BEGIN NOW     It was called Serenadas. END
BEGIN NOW     Soooooooo, the bar was finally sold to someone who knows what to do. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartenders are super fast, super friendly, and always something weird, or interesting on their tv sets. END
BEGIN NOW     They have pool, playing machine, and a HUGE patio for smoking. END
BEGIN NOW     Did I already say cheap drinks?The music is a variety of rock, heavy metal, non heavy metal, and all sorts of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW      Now, hopefully your a dog lover because you might see a few dogs or cats. END
BEGIN NOW     Hard to describe the crowd, but everyone seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, for the 3rd time, cheap drinks!!!!! Oh, they occasionally give you free pizza from next door. END
BEGIN NOW    Who cars about dog, different music, or anything else if you getting served cheap fast drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     There are 4 other bars in the area if you don't like this one. END
BEGIN NOW     Right by the grand theatre, plenty of cabs, near the bus line, so no excuse for you not to go. END
BEGIN NOW     Check it out!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW    The patio is large and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Employees are nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Bouncer is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     Pinball. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool regulars to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW     The lock on the bathroom door works (hard to find at bars). END
BEGIN NOW     Free parking in a lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW     Off the top of my head, last night I can remember hearing Faith No More, High On Fire, The Cramps, and Slayer. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender was wearing a Minor Threat shirt and they had Grindhouse playing on the TV when I walked in around 5:30. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a few doors down from Lanesplitters, who donates the delicious pizza they don't sell at the end of the night to hungry bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW    Last time hanging out on the patio, I witnessed a Blue Heron take a GIANT crap on a couple of screaming girls. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a great place. END
BEGIN NOW    Good prices, pool table, good juke, and a PATIO! A backyard patio is so rare here in Oakland, so it scores. END
BEGIN NOW    A lot of reviewers seem to have had problems with the bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW     I haven't. END
BEGIN NOW     The crowd is cool, too. END
BEGIN NOW     Good people. END
BEGIN NOW    I'd like to have a bit more room inside, and maybe a second pool table, but other than those tiny things, this place rocks. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is pretty great. END
BEGIN NOW    The drinks are cheap here. END
BEGIN NOW     &amp; of course, like most of the dive bars -it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     Luckily they have a BoA and CHASE within walking distance. END
BEGIN NOW     There's also this awesome pizza place next door to go to feed your intoxicated needs. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall a great dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW    a WHOLE lot better than the Ruby Room or Radio. END
BEGIN NOW    (I think its the same owner?). END
BEGIN NOW     The backdoor patio could use a little more lighting though and that nasty lonely blue bulb should be replaced. END
BEGIN NOW    4 stars as room for growth. END
BEGIN NOW     Great little rock and roll neighborhood bar!(too clean to call it a 'dive')They've got  a pool table, a few pinball machines and one of those table ms. END
BEGIN NOW     pacmans. END
BEGIN NOW    Decor is cute, place is clean, and the jukebox is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm really excited about 2 things at this place:#1. END
BEGIN NOW     Tuesday nights. END
BEGIN NOW     (For DML)#2. END
BEGIN NOW     The back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     I can just imagine the awesomeness of meeting friends for booze brunches, or cooling off on balmy(ish) summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW    We wanted to get something to eat after the horrifying West Elm/Pottery Barn warehouse sale a couple weekends back and stumbled upon this place. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is great - a bunch of food and beverage spots all under one roof. END
BEGIN NOW     Kind of reminds me of Gotham West Market in NYC. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the pork tacos smothered in a red sauce, topped with pickled onion and cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW     The two tacos came with a side of pinto beans. END
BEGIN NOW     It was good, the pork was tender, the beans were also good. END
BEGIN NOW     I do agree with most of the other reviews on price, it is kind of steep. END
BEGIN NOW     I think it was $12/$13 for two tacos and some beans. END
BEGIN NOW     the tacos were little so I am not sure why they command such a high price. END
BEGIN NOW     But they were good! If I was in the area again, I would go back for sure. END
BEGIN NOW    A friend said yeah let's go its delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      No. END
BEGIN NOW     It's over priced mexican food that wants to be good for you. END
BEGIN NOW     I ate a torta and may never come here again unless I need to feel good about my food choices or maybe I'll get a salad or something. END
BEGIN NOW      So don't go thinking your going to have mexican food as you will be sadly mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW    Love love freakin LOVE this place! The staff are really nice, food is EXCELLENT!! Great spot to eat for lunch even dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     The tostadas on Tuesday are to die for! MUST TRY! MUST TRY! It'll never disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW     P. END
BEGIN NOW    s. END
BEGIN NOW     Pork belly tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean shut up right!. END
BEGIN NOW    This place is one of my "go-tos" for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I have dined here about 6 times and each time it has been really good. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is limited since its a walk up and order place; they do deliver food to the table and are super nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a local place in the "Swan" center with multiple eateries as well as a fish market inside. END
BEGIN NOW      Handmade tortillas and creative "cocktails" (no hard alcohol, but they do make a good "bloody" style drink with cayenne pepper crusted candy sticks (have only seen these in Mexico before). END
BEGIN NOW      Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Oh yeah, I have had pork, fish, shrimp and chicken tacos - all great!. END
BEGIN NOW    Today we got for lunch the crispy wild shrimp tacos and peach salad! Absolutely fantastic and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Although its crowded we found a table with 3 seatings right away. END
BEGIN NOW    AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything i've gotten here has been incredible and i'm a very big fan (in case you couldn't already tell) Their menu changes so there no guarantee that they will have a certain dish a given night. END
BEGIN NOW     However, I was really impressed by the tamale i had here and the chicken anchiote. END
BEGIN NOW     Comes with awesome sides of rice and beans, tortilla and everything tastes so freshly made. END
BEGIN NOW     Some could argue this place is on the pricier side compared to standard Mexican fare, but at first bite you will realize its absolutely worth it and keep coming back like i do. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha, Cosecha, Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     I have such a weird relationship with you. END
BEGIN NOW     I truly do like you, but you are expensive. END
BEGIN NOW     I recognize that quality ingredients and such tastiness do cost money. END
BEGIN NOW     But, spending $15 on 2 shrimp tacos and some beans in downtown Oakland at a pretty casual spot is insane to me?! Were those deliciously large shrimp tacos so tasty? YES, albeit a bit sloppy to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     Plump wild shrimp, tempura fried with some jalapeno on 2 corn tortillas was perfection. END
BEGIN NOW     I went the blue plate special and at $15 with beans, I was shocked. END
BEGIN NOW     I actually think I wish I bought 2 at $5. END
BEGIN NOW    50 per taco. END
BEGIN NOW     :: FRIDAYS only for those shrimp tacos, btw. END
BEGIN NOW    :: So, there, I said it. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't like dropping $15 on a casual lunch, but those shrimp tacos are so worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     I've actually dined here quite regularly for lunch since my move nearby almost a year ago and you always ignite the same reactions. END
BEGIN NOW     When I'm paying, I gulp and say: how much? But, then my food arrives and I enjoy, maybe even savor every bite and can appreciate the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     And although your portions don't seem huge, they are more than enough food and quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW     In the end, Mexican is one of those foods. END
BEGIN NOW     You expect to pay less and when you don't, you're like, excuse me? But man, Cosecha is so tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     From their tacos, to their tortas, to their quesadillas, I've always been impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     *Seating can be a bit of pain, since this spot's located within Swan's Marketplace. END
BEGIN NOW     A co-op of sorts for local restaurants where they share the seating space. END
BEGIN NOW     Lunch time is always packed weekdays, but taking a quick glance at their Saturday brunch makes me think I've been sleeping on this spot for weekend fare. END
BEGIN NOW    * Their guac is a good, but at $5+ for a small dish, it is totally not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW    Amazing Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     Came here for brunch on Sat (just a suggestion, come here early for brunch) and had bacon tacos with eggs and a side of beans. END
BEGIN NOW     All delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     My girlfriend had the waffles (yup, waffles at a Mexican restaurant!) and they were fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW     To round things out I had the Cosecha Margarita and it was delicious, with orange zest and real worm salt around the rim. END
BEGIN NOW     I know we're coming back for more. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha has very good Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     It's located in a food court-esque building, with a few other restaurants that all share common seating. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend and I went in around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was bumpin. END
BEGIN NOW     We both ordered a quesadilla (I had the grilled peppers and chicken, and he had the mushroom and chicken). END
BEGIN NOW     We also shared some chips and salsa, and the iced horchata latte. END
BEGIN NOW     The prices are bit higher than some Mexican restaurants, but I think it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     I was impressed with everything. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought the horchata latte was great, and actually complemented the spiciness of the quesadilla really well. END
BEGIN NOW     The quesadilla was incredibly well prepared, and the salsa served on the side gave the quesadilla a great flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     I really liked the vibe at Cosecha, and the food was great. END
BEGIN NOW     It's definitely one of my new favorite spots in Oakland (along with Zachary's, Drake's Dealership, and OBTOWN). END
BEGIN NOW    Food = excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     Price point = poor. END
BEGIN NOW     Hence the 4 star average. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved my food but as others have mentioned, I don't think it was worth $15/plate. END
BEGIN NOW     Both my SO and I had the Grilled Chicken Anchiote. END
BEGIN NOW     It is served in a cute clay plate over rice with guacamole and a couple tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Perhaps make the guac optional and lower the price a few bucks? The quality was great and they supposedly use fresh, seasonal/ local ingredients which always jacks up price so I get it. END
BEGIN NOW     to an extent. END
BEGIN NOW     But it's also not a sit down restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     It is cafeteria style- in a large building with other restaurants, much like San Pedro Square Market in San Jose if you've ever been. END
BEGIN NOW     Oakland is certainly stepping up it's food game and this was a great example. END
BEGIN NOW     I would recommend this place but don't expect your fav hole in the wall taqueria prices. END
BEGIN NOW    Chicken tacos are so good. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to come back to eat these!Pork belly was ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Verde mole was ok too, spiciness made up for the dull taste. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything taste so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW    Owner was super nice, bringing us our food. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything we ate was delicious and fresh!! We went during the breakfast menu tired the waffles. END
BEGIN NOW     They were stinking amazing Best waffles I ever ate!!!!! We also had the shrimp tacos also great!!! Wish they served dinner early in the morning I would like to have tired the pork tacos . END
BEGIN NOW    Decent Mexican-themed bar at Swan's Market with a modest menu, whether brunch offerings like the huevos cuaouthemoc (two eggs over beans and salsa de arbol, topped with avocado and handmade flour tortillas) or evening fare like a fresh, crispy fish taco. END
BEGIN NOW     They also offer a few nicely done drinks like their pomegranate margaritas. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, the offerings are reasonably delicious, good quality, and presented nicely, although prices are slightly on the elevated side. END
BEGIN NOW     As this is a small stand inside Swan's Market, there aren't many people working here so service may seem a bit overwhelmed or impersonal at times. END
BEGIN NOW     Nevertheless, if you are here at Swan's Market and want something more substantial than, say, sausages, this isn't a bad choice. END
BEGIN NOW    The short: delicious tacosThis is a line-up and they'll bring your order type place. END
BEGIN NOW     At lunch hour, this place is busy and the wait was around 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW     While waiting, we watched some ladies hand-make the tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Mmmm fresh tortillas! Watch out though. END
BEGIN NOW     The tortilla chips are ultra fried and oily; I almost could feel my arteries clogging up. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered the daily special of two fish tacos (Wednesday and Thursday; Friday has shrimp tacos). END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed them and wished there were more than two!This place (Swan's Marketplace) is an agglomeration of other dining eateries, which makes for a loud, crowded and semi-cramped atmosphere, though the afternoon light streaming through was a nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW    I can't remember which paper or publication I first read about Cosecha (weird that it wasn't Yelp - heh), but I distinctly remember that I had to check this place out because it was Dominica Rice-Cisneros', of Chez Pannise fame, new place. END
BEGIN NOW     On my visit, I tried out two dishes: Chilaquiles and Breakfast Tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Both dishes were quite tasty, but it is definitely quality over quantity here! Cosecha sources fresh, local ingredients, so expect to pay a bit more than your regular mobile/taco truck establishment. END
BEGIN NOW     Located in the Housewives Market (Swan's), you will find Cosecha in what I describe as an upscale food court. END
BEGIN NOW     You place your order at the register, get a number and you will get your meal in around ten minutes or so. END
BEGIN NOW     This place was one that I actually went before opening due to its popularity and I had things to do. END
BEGIN NOW    like holiday shopping!There is plenty of street parking!My buddy and I when we totally beat traffic on a Saturday morning:Uh, what time is it?   Ten o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW     They open at 10:30. END

BEGIN NOW    Cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously, try the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW     Simply the best. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is a Mexican eatery with a nouvelle California twist. END
BEGIN NOW     It's located inside old Oakland's Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW     Solid wooden benches-- amenable to communal style seating -- are set up in front of their ordering counter. END
BEGIN NOW     I actually love shared dining like this; seems only fitting for a 'market' context. END
BEGIN NOW    The open wall aspect of this market is attractive; chose to avoid the interior ceiling fans and be warmed by the direct sun. END
BEGIN NOW     People sitting outside were accompanied by their pets. END
BEGIN NOW     The ordering line took just a bit of time. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved observing the hustle and bustle of the open prep station behind the glass. END
BEGIN NOW      While waiting in line, I perused the paper menu pasted onto the glass counter. END
BEGIN NOW      I was there towards the end of weekend brunch (they close at 3:00 p. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW    ) I ordered the wild shrimp tacos and the horchata latte, following the tip from Bon Appetit's August 2015 issue which featured Oakland dining spots including Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      Place your order at the counter and pay, then servers bring your food out. END
BEGIN NOW      The horchata latte was sheer cinnamon-y goodness served in a tall glass-- light, sweet, and tinged with coffee tones. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought it would be the perfect non-dairy counterpoint to spicy Mexican chillies. END
BEGIN NOW      The two corn tortillas piled high with batter-fried shrimp were nicely presented. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp sat on shredded cabbage, were topped with a chili-infused crema sauce and garnished with jalapeno and cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW     The tacos weren't spicy and the cup of beans on the side were well-flavored. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp were high quality and fresh with a firm bite (none of the mealy texture of aquaculture-produced shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW    ) My only gripe might be the quantity size--too small. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices will reveal that this is not another street-stall taco shop although it functions like one. END
BEGIN NOW     I paid around $15 for the gourmet, delicately flavored shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW      This place offers sufficiently unique taste that it's worth a special treat, but it wouldn't be my daily go-to, based on price alone. END
BEGIN NOW      There are plenty of more ordinary tacquerias for everyday dining. END
BEGIN NOW    I was originally attracted to this restaurant due to its iced horchata latte!  When I saw this on the menu I flipped with excitement and headed to Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      I was expecting an conventional restaurant location, but I found myself at a food market. END
BEGIN NOW      By no means was this a bad thing, it added to the ambiance of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is on a other level, often you hear about a place and it gets so hyped up that you are extremely excited to try it and it let's you down when you finally get to try it. END
BEGIN NOW     well this is not that kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW      The flavors are stupefying!  Yes, I looked up a word to describe what I felt when I had the green pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      I returned and tried the fish tacos special and on my next visit I had the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW      Needless to say, I am a big fan of this place and it's authentic and unique spins on classic dishes. END
BEGIN NOW      Only draw back, it's on the expensive side :(. END
BEGIN NOW    Bomb tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Favorites are the pork belly and chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     Veggie is hit or miss - usually too watery. END
BEGIN NOW      Tortillas are freshly made as you wait in line. END
BEGIN NOW     Chips are greasy, crunchy, and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    This food court makes it easy to go out with coworkers when you're craving different cuisines; however, watch where you sit because vendors will get mad and yell at you to move if you sit in the wrong territory (tables are marked for specific restaurants in the shared space). END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     From the salads to the tortillas for the tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything is made fresh to order. END
BEGIN NOW     Love it. END
BEGIN NOW    I have to say the fish tacos were heavenly. END
BEGIN NOW     I am just in Oakland for the night and looking for a cure for my jet lag. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were the blue plate special. END
BEGIN NOW     They came perfectly done - tempura style, crispy with a little bite. END
BEGIN NOW     Beans with a half an avocado came in the side. END
BEGIN NOW     I will definitely come back!!. END
BEGIN NOW    While having a group dinner inside the Swan Market, friends and I tried a few dishes from each of the establishments inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought the service at Cosecha was great and I liked the menu choices. END
BEGIN NOW      Only major gripe was the value. END
BEGIN NOW      For what we paid, I thought was a bit steep for what we actually got. END
BEGIN NOW      We even ordered the happy hour special which happened to be 2 fish tacos and a pint of beer ($12). END
BEGIN NOW      Unfortunately, the battered fish tacos were so small and didn't satisfy. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos looked delicious, but were slightly bland. END
BEGIN NOW      They have 3 beers on tap which you can choose from including Modelo, an IPA and a chocolate stout. END
BEGIN NOW      Our group ended up getting 4 orders of the tacos/beer ($50+). END
BEGIN NOW      If you have a big appetite like me, you may end up spending more money than you anticipate at Cosecha to fill up your belly. END
BEGIN NOW      May come back, but wouldn't get the tacos next time. END
BEGIN NOW    This is the perfect place for a casual lunch or dinner date. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here several times with my friends and always enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha makes anincredible selection of traditional moles utilizing authentic ingredients and old school recipes. END
BEGIN NOW     I recommend the green mole and their fish tacos to any first-time visitors or regulars that are looking for something different to try. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, if you're fan of Horchata definitely try their horchata espresso! It's my favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW    WONDERFUL!!! Best fish tacos that I have had in ages! The chips and salsa were amazing as well. END
BEGIN NOW    Good food. END
BEGIN NOW     Slight bit pricy but it is the Bay Area and it's downtown and it's quality food so it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     The pork belly tacos were good the meat was light but crispy and the salsa on those were to dye for. END
BEGIN NOW     The carne plate was delicious to real good food but dinner doesn't start until 530 so don't come earlier for that or it won't be there. END
BEGIN NOW     I got 3 plates two drinks 50 bucks easily. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been going here for a couple years now and because of my resolution to Yelp consistently I am making up for my lack of a review for Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW    They have brought a nice high end twist to Mexican food and one of the first places to bring some style with substance to the Old Oakland area. END
BEGIN NOW      Since their arrival they've spurned many great eateries to open up around them. END
BEGIN NOW      Through all the change they've still stood strong with their versions of many classics. END
BEGIN NOW     Think high end taco truck without the truck. END
BEGIN NOW     The various tacos and quesadillas are the stars for me here specifically shrimp (when available) and the Mushroom quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     They also do a mean horchatta latte if you are a horchatta fan. END
BEGIN NOW     My only gripes are that shrimp is just a special on a specific day and that prices are a little high to be a weekly regular. END
BEGIN NOW    Very limited menu. END
BEGIN NOW     One friend got the soft tacos with braised pork &amp; a side of beans. END
BEGIN NOW     Delicious, beyond fork tender. END
BEGIN NOW     Fresh, hand-made tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     This was a keeper and the highlight of our meal. END
BEGIN NOW     Another friend got the chilaquiles with salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW     Same fresh tortillas as the tacos except that they were cut into chips and fried. END
BEGIN NOW     Scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. END
BEGIN NOW     The avocado was perfectly ripe and the crema made the whole dish a luscious bite from beginning to end. END
BEGIN NOW     A good dish but after the wow factor of the braised pork, it was anticlimactic. END
BEGIN NOW     I went against the grain and got breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW     The waffle was yummy but different. END
BEGIN NOW     They pulled it from the iron before it formed a crispy crust. END
BEGIN NOW     It was light and fluffy. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior was fully cooked but it was still moist and tender. END
BEGIN NOW     I added the cajeta sauce which is a Mexican-style caramel. END
BEGIN NOW     So good, I was literally scraping the tiny container for every last drop. END
BEGIN NOW     We also got the chips, guac and salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     My advice, skip the chips that were hard and stale and substitute with the fresh tortillas instead. END
BEGIN NOW     For drinks, we sipped on strawberry limeade. END
BEGIN NOW     So yummy, I was chasing the last drop around the ice. END
BEGIN NOW     Located in the old Swan's Market, I liked the vibe of the place. END
BEGIN NOW     It reminded me of a tiny and more homey SF Ferry Building. END
BEGIN NOW     Very similar to San Jose's San Pedro Square Market. END
BEGIN NOW     If Cosecha isn't your style, there were about 4 other stalls including one featuring Japanese food and another serving hot dogs and beer. END
BEGIN NOW     There was also a wine merchant. END
BEGIN NOW     I wish I had a cooler. END
BEGIN NOW     There was a butcher and a fishmonger offering raw product for purchase. END
BEGIN NOW     About 3 blocks from the 12th St. END
BEGIN NOW     Bart station, it easy to get to. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be back. END
BEGIN NOW    I had the most expensive shrimp taco here. END
BEGIN NOW     And it was basically one shrimp and one taco! Over 5bucks after tax. END
BEGIN NOW     I was still hungry afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW    one of my favorites!i've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of my experiences were great. END
BEGIN NOW     the waffle at breakfast, the delicious pico and guacamole, the horchata latte. END
BEGIN NOW    all so delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW    Did someone say vegan quesadillas and strawberry margaritas? If so, I'm all in!I love how Cosecha uses sweet potato in their vegan quesadillas rather than using some fake rubbery cheese substitute. END
BEGIN NOW     They also do not skimp on the guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW     You get some inside the quesadilla itself and some on the side along with a deliciously spicy salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW     You can also choose from mushrooms, green chile, etc to go inside your quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW    The kicker to this meal though, was the asparagus and braised chickpeas. END
BEGIN NOW     It might have been a special, but if you see it on the menu, do not hesitate and order it! The chubbiest asparagus I had ever seen, topped with perfect chickpeas in a really rich saucy broth. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll be dreaming about this asparagus for eternity. END
BEGIN NOW    My strawberry margarita was also memorable. END
BEGIN NOW     It wasn't overly sweet and actually tasted like limes and real strawberries rather than the artificial syrupy stuff. END
BEGIN NOW    All in all, I really enjoyed my meal here at Cosecha from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't wait to try other menu items!. END
BEGIN NOW    In the search of good Mexican food we wanted to love this place, and were really disappointed! We saw this place on KQED and decided to give it a try. END
BEGIN NOW     We were there on a Wednesday around 5, restaurant was pretty empty, no excuse for what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW    Here are my complaints:1. END
BEGIN NOW     PRICES: They are way out of line for counter service &amp; communal seating: $13 for two tiny fish tacos, $15 for Pork Adobado plate, $3 for chips salsa and guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW     There are far better taco places (such as Tracy DeJardin's place in the SF Ferry Building) which are MUCH less expensive, better quality2. END
BEGIN NOW     QUALITY: The food was not prepared well. END
BEGIN NOW     Rice was gummy and EVERYTHING was super greasy. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips and fish tacos were literally swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW     No one drained a damn thing. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were very smelly too. END
BEGIN NOW     Probably should not have eaten them. END
BEGIN NOW     Pork plate was missing avocado and had a few pieces of gross, shriveled zucchini on the side. END
BEGIN NOW     Very unappetizing. END
BEGIN NOW    3. END
BEGIN NOW     PORTIONS: Chip order was sad. END
BEGIN NOW     With only a few cold greasy chips. END
BEGIN NOW     Skimpy on the salsa as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were absolutely tiny and each plated on one small tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW     WAY too expensive for portion size. END
BEGIN NOW     Pork plate had two tiny tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW    4. END
BEGIN NOW     SERVICE: Worker at the counter was barely civil. END
BEGIN NOW     I asked for extra tortillas with our pork plate, forgot them. END
BEGIN NOW     Ticket was cooked wrong- one order came out far in advance of the other. END
BEGIN NOW     The counter worker slammed down the pork plate about a mile away (we were sitting on a big communal table) from us. END
BEGIN NOW     Very abrupt and rude. END
BEGIN NOW    ***I suspect the owner was absent and it showed. END
BEGIN NOW     Place is run poorly! Not a good experience, we will not go back. END
BEGIN NOW    ***. END
BEGIN NOW    We tried their duck special on the weekend and the food was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The dishes are well prepared and the portion sizes were decent. END
BEGIN NOW     They are trying to add a high end twist to their food. END
BEGIN NOW     Their corn tortillas are very good, I think it is freshly made on site very day. END
BEGIN NOW     It is a food court style dining in Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     The dining was casual and we could get beer and other food from the other eateries in the food court. END
BEGIN NOW    I noticed many of the other customers getting their wild shrimp taco specials. END
BEGIN NOW     We will try that when we go their next time. END
BEGIN NOW     We did not know this place until we saw them on KQED - Check Please Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW    The owner greets you right away and everything is fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a mushroom and cheese quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     It tasted so fresh!! The next day I had the shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     The best I have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't wait to return. END
BEGIN NOW    It's sad that it's come to this. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to love this place but it seems that in all the trendy-ness and influx of consumers in Oakland, people have just forgotten about customer service. END
BEGIN NOW     In the past I have enjoyed certain dishes from Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     (You have to know what to order here, as their meats can be dry, making certain dishes way overpriced) And usually the service is pretty good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW     My last visit, however, was very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW     The line (which can get long here) wasn't, thankfully and I tried to place my order but before I could do so the owner (the female) called the guy at the register away. END
BEGIN NOW     He was nice about it at first and said he would be right back. END
BEGIN NOW     The owner was giving him instructions which was fine but as he kept trying to come back to me to take my order, she kept pulling him away (keep in mind that she was facing me and fully aware that there was a customer waiting the entire time) until he finally came back to me and said "we are too busy, I have to go help in the back and I can't take your order". END
BEGIN NOW     Are you serious right now? How unprofessional and rude to keep a customer waiting and then ultimately TURN THEM AWAY?!? Get your act together. END
BEGIN NOW    What first called my attention to this restaurant was this Facebook post: facebook. END
BEGIN NOW    com/permalink. END
BEGIN NOW    p…They were obviously more than just a restaurant; they realized the impact of our everyday interactions and are helping taking responsibility as a community towards real change. END
BEGIN NOW     So last week when BART went down halfway through my commute home, my husband had to come pick me up from Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     We decided to have dinner in the area and came here. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm so glad we did! My husband and I split an order of shrimp tacos and carne adobada. END
BEGIN NOW     It was delicious and the meat was very tender. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm also not big on beans but OMG I ate em' up here! Also, homemade tortillas are never a bad idea. END
BEGIN NOW     My 6 year olds had a chicken quesadilla with rice &amp; beans and drank horchata. END
BEGIN NOW     They loved it! Very good food and excellent service. END
BEGIN NOW     I also love the idea that this place is a bit pricey (hear me out!) It's always bothered me so much that people just assume Mexican food has to cheap. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes, taco trucks are great and nobody gets mad at a cheap meal but Mexican food can be just as fancy-pants as the rest of ya. END
BEGIN NOW    Today was my first time trying Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the special which was 2 crispy fish tacos and beans with avocado for $11. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was awesome! It is a bit pricey, so I don't think I will be eating here very often, but it was good food and Steve Kerr and his crew showed up and everyone was clapping. END
BEGIN NOW     So for that reason, I will give this place another star. END
BEGIN NOW     LOL. END
BEGIN NOW    Fish taco special is a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW      Can get better fry and quality at Rubios. END
BEGIN NOW     The fry was decent but the fish was whatever. END
BEGIN NOW      The torta made bread soggy, the meat was weak. END
BEGIN NOW      Overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW     Customer service is rude. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely a great Mexican food restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Their menu changes, which keeps things interesting. END
BEGIN NOW     I actually did take out one night and got the mushroom quesadilla and grilled chicken quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     They were both very flavorful and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     Portion size is reasonable for the price. END
BEGIN NOW     I especially liked that they used corn tortilla for the quesadillas. END
BEGIN NOW     I also ordered their chips, which I thought were well salted (which I like) but drenched in grease. END
BEGIN NOW     They were too greasy for me, but I still managed to finish most of them! Also the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW     The person was friendly and helpful on the phone, even though I couldn't decide what to order. END
BEGIN NOW     I picked up my order with no problems! Great experience, will come back to try all of their tacos next!. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm basing this review on food quality as well as service. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a miscommunication on their part which delayed our order. END
BEGIN NOW     My co-worker and I ordered shrimp tacos and honestly they tasted like shrimp donuts. END
BEGIN NOW     We didn't enjoy the batter and there was not enough sauce on the tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall dish it was lacking flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Next time I'm going to Belly's for shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Problem solved. END
BEGIN NOW    WOW. END
BEGIN NOW     The food here is incredible!  The selection is very limited (4-5 items on the menu), but we tried the tacos and quesadilla, and they were both amazing!!!  The meats were moist, tender and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      The sauces were perfect. END
BEGIN NOW      The tortillas were warm and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    This is food court style dining, with an option to purchase beer from one of the other eateries. END
BEGIN NOW      Super casual, you order at the counter and they bring it to you. END
BEGIN NOW     Very delicous. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't wait to come back again!. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm going to eat here again because I only had the totopos but they were great. END
BEGIN NOW     I wanted to try more stuff, but we were doing a day drinking order a bunch of stuff thing so this seemed the most appropriate. END
BEGIN NOW    One of my favorite places to eat in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     They have delicious food that tastes homemade. END
BEGIN NOW     I love their yam/mushroom quesadillas and their seasonal fruit salad with cucumber, pumpkin seeds, jicama, and citrus vin. END
BEGIN NOW    I was here for a business lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu is a little pricey but the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW     To be honest, chips and salsa with guac being close to $6 was a little  excessive. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish tacos, however were worth the cost. END
BEGIN NOW     They tasted great, the fish was fresh, and the plating was pleasing. END
BEGIN NOW     Surprisingly, I was full after the fish tacos even though the portion looked small. END
BEGIN NOW    This was my destination food stand for a while (before the influx of B-Dama, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    ) at Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW     Focus on organic (when possible) ingredients and limited but well executed menu. END
BEGIN NOW     We've brought friends here (HS &amp; MD) who really enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW     J typically gets the tacos, guac + chips. END
BEGIN NOW     Initially, I enjoyed their vegan tacos (been eating here since 2011), but alas, since then, I have noticed more and more salt. END
BEGIN NOW     For the average person who is not sensitive to salt, I would recommend Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW    Went for the New Year's Brunch today!Great food, but their concept of pay, get a number and the food is delivered is not working. END
BEGIN NOW      One of us got their food and the other had to wait a long time for their food. END
BEGIN NOW    We originally chose this restaurant because they were one of the few in downtown Oakland that had outdoor seating for dinner and we had our dog with us. END
BEGIN NOW    Necessity soon turned into luck Sharee as we hungrily dove into fresh vegetables and equally fresh meats. END
BEGIN NOW     My favorite meal was the blood orange salad with grilled chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     It was the perfect mix of flavors with toasted pumpkin seeds butter lettuce and a fresh citrus vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW     Portions are not too large (as I prefer), and prices represent the gentrification occurring in the bay area but still reasonable for the quality of food provided. END
BEGIN NOW    Great spot for post happy hour drunken eats. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the fish tacos, which are excellent, although steep at 13 pesos. END
BEGIN NOW      You basically only get two small fish tacos as well as some rice and beans. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was also pretty slow, it seems they only had one guy running back and forth taking orders at the register and waitering food out to diners. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is always good, but the prices or service are never consistent. END
BEGIN NOW     I paid about 5$ for a meal one day and the next was charged 8$. END
BEGIN NOW     Sometimes they are polite and other days incredibly rude. END
BEGIN NOW    I fell for the ratings. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the fish tacos and if it weren't for the pickled onions and dressing, they would have been plain and boring. END
BEGIN NOW     I was not too pleased. END
BEGIN NOW     Previous commenter called it a"yuppie" Mexican place, I agree. END
BEGIN NOW     Beans and rice were good, service was not so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Be prepared to hunt for napkins, sugar for tea, and a fork in different places. END
BEGIN NOW     Chips were real greasy and stuck together, but salsa was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     I should have tried the other places around here. END
BEGIN NOW     I was really craving authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW     Not the place. END
BEGIN NOW     I must have just ordered the wrong thing. END
BEGIN NOW     So disappointed :-(. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here twice now and was very impressed both times. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly employees, the homemade chips and guacamole are great, as is everything else. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall atmosphere is very friendly as well. END
BEGIN NOW    This shared restaurant space is creative and interesting--kind of like a very upscale food court. END
BEGIN NOW     Food itself is super delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't usually associate Mexican cuisine with haute cuisine--I'm a cheap taco loving girl, after all, but if you're going to do Mexican with fancy ingredients, these guys do it exceptionally well. END
BEGIN NOW     All dishes were delicious and freshly cook. END
BEGIN NOW     Sangria was good, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Massively overpriced and small portions. END
BEGIN NOW     I had two small fish tacos, rice and chips for $20. END
BEGIN NOW     This would cost $10 anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW     Disappointing ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW    The torta is good. END
BEGIN NOW     I have been here several times but today was different. END
BEGIN NOW    I experienced the worst, absolute, worst service I have ever experienced in my life. END
BEGIN NOW     The lady at the register and the owner were ridiculously rude. END
BEGIN NOW     I was surprised at first because the owner is usually smiling, and for the most part, you don't run into issues at the register (register lady is rarely friendly). END
BEGIN NOW     She said I placed the incorrect order over the phone and I'm responsible for paying it (4x the cost of what I ordered). END
BEGIN NOW     This went back and forth for a minute until she finally charged me for the correct order. END
BEGIN NOW     As I was signing the receipt, she told me to never place these small orders over the phone and that they are doing me a favor for this one mistake I made. END
BEGIN NOW     I responded with, "this is bullshit. END
BEGIN NOW    " Both the cashier and owner, became increasingly rude, and at this point, had an aggressive and hostile tone and told me this is my fault. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm a native English speaker with a law degree. END
BEGIN NOW     The cashier has a thick Mexican accent. END
BEGIN NOW     I also had the phone on speaker, with one other person sitting with me (she ordered B-Dama's pork cutlet), when I placed the phone order. END
BEGIN NOW     This order was just for me. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm damn sure I didn't make a mistake. END
BEGIN NOW      She told me to get out, to get out of a DAMN food court. END
BEGIN NOW     I think this is a part of a bigger problem, a growing service culture of attitude and arrogance in Oakland and you're starting to see it in SF. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not sure what is causing the growth of a terrible service culture. END
BEGIN NOW     It is a culture that lacks accountability, responsibility, and respect. END
BEGIN NOW     As a restaurant, you live and die by your patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Each patron is an asset, extremely valuable, and deserving of respect. END
BEGIN NOW     Sure, every restaurant runs into their troll or exceptionally rude customer, but even in this situation, it makes more business sense to take the high road and appease the customer. END
BEGIN NOW     Who knows? maybe this growing attitude in the service culture is a response to Yelp, online trolls, and people constantly sh!&amp;&amp;ing on restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW     Whatever it is, you should never act the way this owner and cashier acted toward me-- irresponsible, immature, condescending, defensive, and hostile. END
BEGIN NOW    While I will never say their tortas are bad because that would be lying, I actually think they are pretty damn good, I will never spend a dollar at a place that lacks the proper decorum. END
BEGIN NOW    Delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW      Just had a quesadilla and pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      So good!  Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Got the huevos cuauhtemoc, breakfast tacos, iced horchata latte, and a mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW     The homemade tortillas make this place. END
BEGIN NOW     HOWEVER, the price and limited seating puts a damper on the experience. END
BEGIN NOW     A great place to try, but doubt becoming a regular. END
BEGIN NOW    We dined on the Saturday specials. END
BEGIN NOW      Chilaquiles, one with a smokey salsa Rojo and one with Verde both were well prepared and tasty as were the Wild shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything was very fresh and made to order. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a good selection of beer &amp; wine. END
BEGIN NOW     It is located in the historic Swan Market building &amp; shares an open dining area with another restaurant &amp; a bar. END
BEGIN NOW      You order, find a table and they deliver to your table. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a lovely fall day and they open the doors and had tables on the sidewalk in addition to the dining hall. END
BEGIN NOW     It is kid friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Yesterday was the second time that I ate at Cosecha, and we came specifically for the Chicken Mole Verde blue plate special that is available on Mondays. END
BEGIN NOW    The first time I had tried Cosecha was on a Friday night when they were featuring Wild Shrimp Tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     They were incredible. END
BEGIN NOW    To me, it is hard to find a fabulous Mexican food/restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     A Mexican restaurant that doesn't put a fusion twist on it, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for ordinary. END
BEGIN NOW     You can find ordinary almost anywhere in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     It's usually always the same. END
BEGIN NOW     My best friend growing up was first generation Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW     The family would get together and cook big regional meals from old family recipes. END
BEGIN NOW     Out of the ordinary, but not necessarily worthy of the hype everyone tends to give for something "out of the ordinary", but it allowed for me to be exposed to really GOOD, "non-traditional" Mexican food at a young age. END
BEGIN NOW    I LOVE Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     I love that they don't have a huge 3 page menu. END
BEGIN NOW     I love that their food is incredibly fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     I love how clean their kitchen appears to be. END
BEGIN NOW     and I love that you can see part of their cooking process. END
BEGIN NOW     Good wait staff too!The food here is like eating someone's secret recipes. END
BEGIN NOW      The food has a "slight" twist to the ordinary, and almost akin to eating in someone's family home. END
BEGIN NOW    The Chicken Mole Verde was fantastic (not your typical mole sauce made with chocolate). END
BEGIN NOW     Consecha's sauce had a little bit of bite/heat to it, but it was spicy without burning your mouth, and without lasting effect. END
BEGIN NOW     So pleasant to eat! To top it off, the chicken was nicely shredded and topped off with roasted pumpkin seeds, and a few slices of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW     The beans. END
BEGIN NOW    not your refried variety, were cooked to the right consistency, not overcooked and falling apart and nicely flavored, as was the rice which also was not your typical Mexican rice. END
BEGIN NOW     It was white rice, though it did not taste like plain white rice. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm sure that also had a secret ingredient. END
BEGIN NOW     Served with warm corn tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW    Did I mention that Cosecha has absolutely the best Horchata that I have ever had? It's not thick, it's not watery, it has a hint of cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW     I would like a glass of it every single day! Very refreshing during warm weather too. END
BEGIN NOW    The food presentation is lovely and equal to any upscale restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Each blue plate special had a nice cloth under each plate. END
BEGIN NOW     The plates themselves were very nice earthenware. END
BEGIN NOW     I just can't say enough about the entire experience. END
BEGIN NOW    As others have said, Cosecha is in the old Swann's marketplace and is more like an open air food court. END
BEGIN NOW      You place your order at the counter, and they bring it to your table. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are hooked on burritos at Chipotle, I would not suggest you go here. END
BEGIN NOW      If you are looking for really good, out of the ordinary, quality Mexican food with that "slight" twist, this is the place for you. END
BEGIN NOW     Not cheap, but not expensive for what you get. END
BEGIN NOW     P. END
BEGIN NOW    S. END
BEGIN NOW      The food portions are perfect, but not "super sized". END
BEGIN NOW      If you are a big eater, you may want to get an appetizer. END
BEGIN NOW    Can't wait to go back!. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is pretty good and I have only been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW     Most recently for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I got the Chilaquiles and we split the waffle. END
BEGIN NOW     The waffle was like butta! The Chilaquiles were really good, but couldn't eat the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW     It's on the pricer side, but good nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was delicious!!! Ordered the quesadilla with peppers and braised pork. END
BEGIN NOW     The tortilla was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     It tasted freshly made. END
BEGIN NOW     The pork was tender. END
BEGIN NOW     It looked small when they brought it out but it was quite filling!! Pomegranate margarita was pretty good, a bit strong. END
BEGIN NOW     The horchata latte looked good will def try that next time. END
BEGIN NOW    Fantastic place! Cosheca is honestly the reason I even started writing yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the pleasure of trying their fish tacos, which were so fresh and had incredible flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     The pinto beans really sealed the deal for me as they had just the perfect amount of seasoning and texture and really complimented the dish. END
BEGIN NOW     Also tried their horchatta latte, which was simply genius. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was very efficient and friendly and my food arrived promptly after ordering. END
BEGIN NOW     I cannot recommend Cosecha enough! Already craving their fish tacos as I write this review. END
BEGIN NOW    Ok those shrimp tacos on Friday are LEGIT. END
BEGIN NOW     We went other times and food was good but didn't knock my socks off. END
BEGIN NOW     We WILL be back for these tacos ASAP!. END
BEGIN NOW    Came on a Saturday for take out brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Had the wild shrimp tacos, strawberry lime drink. END
BEGIN NOW      Amazing!  Even more so was the fact that I got a free chocolate chip cookie. END
BEGIN NOW     All was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    contemplating going back for more!  Definitely my new go to for brunch in Old Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been on the hunt for really good Mexican food since moving to the bay area - living in San Diego (aka, California's Best Border Town) spoiled me rotten. END
BEGIN NOW     There I was treated to the best guacamole and fish tacos north of Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW     When I heard about Cosecha, I was over the moon. END
BEGIN NOW     but while my high expectations probably weren't very helpful, this was definitely not a 5-star experience. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant is buried in a warehouse maze - an interesting space, just a liiiiittle hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW     We had a table reserved, thanks to a friend who plans ahead - but there was no one available to ask about said table. END
BEGIN NOW     There was 1 server running around like a madwoman, and 1 guy at the cash register taking/filling orders, but no one else. END
BEGIN NOW     People were wandering around uncertain as to whether they should seat themselves or wait to be seated. END
BEGIN NOW     we finally went to the wine store next door (which has no door/sign/anything marking it as a separate entity) hoping to get our questions answers. END
BEGIN NOW     The place just seemed completely disorganized. END
BEGIN NOW    So here's how it works! It's family-style self-seating at long picnic tables, unless you make a reservation, and then you can get a private table in the back. END
BEGIN NOW     If you wait for a server to seat you or come to your table, you'll wait forever - order at the front counter, by the register. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu &amp; specials are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but beware: we'd come for the night's special, wild shrimp tacos, but they were sold out by 6pm. END
BEGIN NOW     We were baffled - it was early and the place wasn't even crowded. END
BEGIN NOW     Not cool to sell out of your Dinner Special at the beginning of dinnertime. END
BEGIN NOW     They also need more staff on the floor - for 40 minutes we had water but no glasses. END
BEGIN NOW     Which went well with our chicken/pork tortillas that were missing tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW    The food was good - the kind of good you're psyched to eat, but not the kind of good you'd return for. END
BEGIN NOW     We tried the grilled chicken achiote - chicken marinated in achiote with rice, beans &amp; handmade tortillas, and the carne adovada - braised pork with chile guajillo, beans, rice &amp; tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Really good guacamole!! The tortillas were handmade and delicious; the rest of the dish was fresh but unremarkable. END
BEGIN NOW     The people who work here are incredibly nice - but they're also really overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe now that Cosecha is so popular, they'll make it more user friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    ?. END
BEGIN NOW    Mmmmm!!! Pork belly taco. END
BEGIN NOW     Never had anything like that before. END
BEGIN NOW     You probably think I'm crazy but it had a savory cotton candy like taste. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome haha. END
BEGIN NOW     The horchata was a little gritty. END
BEGIN NOW     The chicken taco also had amazing flavor and was very tender. END
BEGIN NOW    Food court dinning with excellent Mexican food at a moderate price. END
BEGIN NOW      All of the salads are quite nice as well as the Carnitas and tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      It is great on Fridays when the Farmer's market is open. END
BEGIN NOW    Staying in downtown Oakland, we checked out Yelp for a good place for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     Interestingly, on Saturday night, not to many restaurants seem to be open in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW     We found this place interesting per the description, plus it wasn't far from our hotel. END
BEGIN NOW    It's an interesting concept for a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Only a limited menu but the restaurant is more like an upscale cafe stall. END
BEGIN NOW     It's in conjuction with several other similar eateries each having different types of food, like pizza, oysters, all with a common eating  area between them. END
BEGIN NOW      We had the quesadillas and also ordered a margherita  pizza from the pizza stall. END
BEGIN NOW     Very tasty food!! I would have given 4/5 stars, but the portions were really small for the prices paid. END
BEGIN NOW    We're all surely spoiled with the great eats at Swan's Marketplace - my usual entry point is through Rosamunde and I've never quite made it far enough to get to Cosecha - fortunately I went on a Monday when things are just a bit more mellow and conducive to browsing. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried the pork torta with what appeared to be twice fried tortilla chips (no complaints there) and fresh guac - the food was exactly what I was hoping for and the portions were fair. END
BEGIN NOW      Now, spending $17 on a torta, chips &amp; a sparking water is definitely excessive and arguably insane but Cosecha isn't the odd ball when it comes to the modern urban lunch pricing that is nearing $20/person so it's hard to hold that against them. END
BEGIN NOW    The menu is simple and from the looks of the other patrons plates all of the various dishes are a hit - definitely worth a shot. END
BEGIN NOW    especially if you're in the mood for Cholita Linda style food on a Monday (they're closed). END
BEGIN NOW    Simple, and súper delicioso! Had the Blue Plate fish tacos and both my parents - who are hard to please- loved them! Also, the small black bean soup is savory and light. END
BEGIN NOW     We topped it off with the cucumber-lime drink which was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     Tan delicioso que ni siquiera podimos tomar foto de la comida comimos tan rápido!. END
BEGIN NOW    I can't possibly express how much I love Cosecha, or Swans Market Place as a matter of fact. END
BEGIN NOW     The market never disappoints, and I never had anything I didn't love at Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     We started with salsa and guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW     We could tell the salsa was fresh and made with heirloom tomatoes from the color of it. END
BEGIN NOW     The flavor of the salsa was vibrant and the guacamole was fresh and perfectly seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW     Then we had the fish taco and pork belly taco. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish was fresh, with nice and crispy flaky batter. END
BEGIN NOW      Pork belly was juicy on the inside and nicely charred on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW     And oh my god, the chocolate chip cookie! So good!. END
BEGIN NOW    The food may be ok but the organization and service are terrible. END
BEGIN NOW     The help is incompetent and indifferent. END
BEGIN NOW     Our most recent experience had them losing our order after we paid, and they didn't even have a record of it, and they hadn't given us a receipt. END
BEGIN NOW     After over 40 minutes of waiting for our order, and being repeatedly told, It's coming right up. END
BEGIN NOW     They conceded they hadn't placed our order and didn't even know what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW     We asked that they just give us what was available but that wasn't acceptable, so we would have to wait another 40 minutes to try again. END
BEGIN NOW     So about then we demanded our money back and left. END
BEGIN NOW     Previously we had asked a server to clean our table because it was cluttered and dirty from the previous diners. END
BEGIN NOW     One young man took part of their junk, didn't wipe the table and never came back. END
BEGIN NOW     We asked two more times before someone was willing to give us a clean table. END
BEGIN NOW    Blue plate fish tacos are a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW      Quality was fine, but you pay close to $13 for two tiny tacos that are smaller than an appetizer anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW      Chips and salsa are not even included. END
BEGIN NOW     I won't be coming here again. END
BEGIN NOW    I think they've done away with the $10 minimum on credit/debit cards? I came back here the other day with a major craving for their veggie torta, and they accepted my debit card. END
BEGIN NOW     Yay!. END
BEGIN NOW    Oakland is definitely up and coming and this market is apart of the gentrification process. END
BEGIN NOW      This place has a wine bar and they are installing some other restaurants to make it into a modern food court cooperative. END
BEGIN NOW      The lamb and beans were good, pork tacos were EXCELLENT (YOU MUST TRY) and the crab ceviche was ok. END
BEGIN NOW      The blood orange, pine nuts, and chicken salad was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the special hibiscus tequila cocktail and it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      I appreciate everything is made from scratch!The service is quick and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW      Erico was really nice, not to mention extremely cute and charming. END
BEGIN NOW      This place closes at 9:30 p. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW     Friday night so make sure you come early enough time to talk, eat and drink!  Parking was easy on 9th street. END
BEGIN NOW    Honest, solid, yummy Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     High quality meats really pack the punch in flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Generally not a huge pork belly fan, but the pork belly tacos were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The braised beef tacos I loved even more. END
BEGIN NOW     Quesadillas were outstanding! Thick, scrumptious cheeses and vegetables sandwiched between homemade, rich, flavorful tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     House made chips and guacamole really sealed the deal for me. END
BEGIN NOW     Do yourself a favor and have a Mexican mocha. END
BEGIN NOW     or two! Sooo good! Not a fan of sweet coffee? The horchata iced latte is delightful. END
BEGIN NOW     A must have to complete the Cosecha experience!. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been back to this place 2 weekends in a row now b/c right around Friday night at 7:30, I start dreaming about those cornmeal waffles that they only make on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW      $12 for a waffle isn't cheap (includes fruit + cream), but why budget your cravings?I've also had the Pozoles which is nice and spicy and good on a chilly cloudy day. END
BEGIN NOW     Have also enjoyed the shrimp tacos, the mushroom quesadillas and the pork tacos - all are decent (but not exceptionally better than what I might find at my local taco trucks), but the waffles - that's what I come here for. END
BEGIN NOW    Unfortunately, for my first try at Cosescha the chef must have been out for the day. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the special of the day, to-go after a long day. END
BEGIN NOW     I got home and excitedly opened my dinner only to be greeted by a sad, sad little flake of fish with only a wilted piece of lettuce and a few slices of peppers. END
BEGIN NOW     It actually prompted me to take my first yelp picture it was so pathetic. END
BEGIN NOW     To add insult to injury, I now have to go back out to grab a real dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     I should have checked the box so I could have rectified on the spot, but the reviews gave me the sense that I was in good hands. END
BEGIN NOW    The last time we ate here they weren't officially open for dinners and we got in by sending an email and getting into one of their community dinners. END
BEGIN NOW     We had a great meal and sat at a community table next to this really nice couple who were just starting their catering business while still working full time at their day jobs. END
BEGIN NOW      Fast forward to now. END
BEGIN NOW    their business has taken off (S+S Gastro Grub). END
BEGIN NOW    and we finally get a chance to use them for an upcoming company holiday party!  I tell this part because you can never underestimate the power of the community table in a town like Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    and Cosecha gave us a warm and fuzzy feeling from the very beginning. END
BEGIN NOW    Stopped in with daughter for a wonderful lunch today. END
BEGIN NOW      One bite of the yam quesadilla and I couldn't stop talking about it. END
BEGIN NOW      Just tasted so "real. END
BEGIN NOW    " The tortilla was flavorful and the whole thing didn't need the sauces that came with it on the side. END
BEGIN NOW     Daughter had the queso fundido and the pozole and liked them both. END
BEGIN NOW     We also had the horchata which was very good. END
BEGIN NOW    I timed it badly that I came on a Monday, because there are no seafood taco offerings on Mondays. END
BEGIN NOW     It would be nice to always have fish tacos on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    but maybe that's fine, as then I wouldn't have tried the yam quesadilla!  Lovely atmosphere and super friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     We'll be back sooner this time!. END
BEGIN NOW    Jackpot. END
BEGIN NOW      Blue Plate Special - fish tacos, with beans and avocado garnish. END
BEGIN NOW     Twelve bucks. END
BEGIN NOW      Superb. END
BEGIN NOW     Crisp, flaky fry outside and soft, luscious fish inside. END
BEGIN NOW     The beans were so savory. END
BEGIN NOW     This happening joint is in a big warehouse filled with other places doibg the same deal. END
BEGIN NOW     Large tables are available allowing people to meet and mingle. END
BEGIN NOW     Water is on all the tables. END
BEGIN NOW       So groovy!. END
BEGIN NOW    I wanted a meal, not an overpriced "quick snack. END
BEGIN NOW    " Two little shrimp tacos for fifteen bucks? No gracias. END
BEGIN NOW     It wasn't quick either. END
BEGIN NOW     Left annoyed and hungry--won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW    I came on a Thursday hoping to get my fish taco fix but was sadly disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW     How are two very small tacos with a side of plain ol' rice and black beans supposed to fill you up for $13? Topping the fish tacos were large pieces of jalapeño which overpowered what little fish I ate. END
BEGIN NOW     In addition we got an order of tortilla chips and salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips were extremely oily and the salsa came in a small container which we had to ask for a second filling because we were hungry still. END
BEGIN NOW     I do like the market but don't think I'll be ordering from here again. END
BEGIN NOW    Fancy, super hip, beautifully presented "Meso- American" twist on Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     Familiar and surprising at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW     Sangria was excellent!!! Pico de gallo was exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW     Located in middle of downtown with lots of access to drinks or dancing afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW     Portions are medium/small and prices are moderate/high- don't arrive starving. END
BEGIN NOW     Would definitely stop by again for a pre-drinks fancy snack. END
BEGIN NOW    Its pricey, but this place has the best food i have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     Especially the pork in the pork belly tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     Soo perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here a few times and am every time so impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     The ingredients are absolutely as fresh, seasonal, and creative as they claim, and the execution of flavors is clearly well-conceived. END
BEGIN NOW     This place would be easy to miss, so if you're in the area and love delicious, thoughtful, and bold Mexican food, don't miss Cosecha!. END
BEGIN NOW    Best zucchini tacos I ever ate!  Guacamole was amazing, too. END
BEGIN NOW    1. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to marry the chef2. END
BEGIN NOW     Best chocolate chip cookie outside of the ones my mom made when I was growing up. END
BEGIN NOW     3. END
BEGIN NOW     Get the corn - it will make you want to (see #1). END
BEGIN NOW    Amazing atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     In a busy area of Oakland you can find this precious food court that has a home feeling. END
BEGIN NOW     And Cosecha seriously serves you real Mexican food topped with elegant balance of flavors, also thanks to Dominica ( Chez Panisse for years ). END
BEGIN NOW    I was walking to my car after lunch and looked to see what Cosecha's daily special was and saw Mole Verde con Pollo. END
BEGIN NOW     There's always room for another taco right? $3. END
BEGIN NOW    97 including tax. END
BEGIN NOW    They've reduced the diameter of their handmade taco tortillas with the same amount of meats &amp; sauce making a much better balance between fillings &amp; tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     The taco comes topped with fresh white onions and pepitas (and usually cilantro yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/bGc4…). END
BEGIN NOW    Tender and moist (poached?) chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     The mole is lightly rich and mildly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW     They've had different moles for the Monday Chicken Mole special so call ahead, if you're looking for a specific type (Negro, Poblano, Verde, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    ). END
BEGIN NOW    Seriously? Don't knowI don't know what the big deal is. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish tacos were ok. END
BEGIN NOW     Nicely deep fried fish sitting on a piece of lettuce, sitting on corn tortilla with some aioli dripped on it. END
BEGIN NOW     Unremarkable. END
BEGIN NOW     Chicken tacos less remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW     They did not have the quesadillas available (half the menu). END
BEGIN NOW        Horchata the sweetest I've ever tasted which, for me, not a plus. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered chips and salsa and got 10 stale chips and 1 tablespoon of salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     Go to the Tacos El Gordo taco truck on International in Oakland for much better food at 1/4 the price!. END
BEGIN NOW    Had the fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     They were decent but not worth the price. END
BEGIN NOW     Portions are small, service was disinterested at best. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool spot though, lots of potential. END
BEGIN NOW    Holy frijol, Cosecha is delicious!I usually find fancier Mexican food to be suspect, but hey, I don't see any taco trucks in Downtown Oakland, and Cosecha has rave reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     This hesitation was before I knew that they have butternut squash quesadillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Had I known I would have made like a jumping bean and come pronto. END
BEGIN NOW     This butternut squash quesadilla is amazing-and you have the option of adding meat or keeping it vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW     The carnivore prevailed and their delicious grilled chicken was added. END
BEGIN NOW     That Oaxacan cheese is a lipid lovers dream-so good. END
BEGIN NOW      Their tacos I had on my second visit didn't dazzle me, but not much would after trying my drug of choice, the bnsquash quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     I could definitely taste that the housemade tortilla and meats were quality, though. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the open air space, friendly service (the owner gave me a free oatmeal cookie hotouttadaoven), and boon to one of Oakland's most picturesque blocks. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll definitely be back to reap what Cosecha is sowing. END
BEGIN NOW    No stars the food was horrible. END
BEGIN NOW      The quesadillas were disgusting &amp; bland. END
BEGIN NOW      I tired to change my order they refused to give me another plate &amp; give me my money back. END
BEGIN NOW       She said that the shrimp was to expensive. END
BEGIN NOW      Never again will I come back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Rude rude rude. END
BEGIN NOW    Sometimes, I just have to scratch my head and wonder about people's taste. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, it's subjective. END
BEGIN NOW      But I can't for the life of me figure out why this restaurant gets such rave reviews. END
BEGIN NOW     Is there such a dearth of good Bay Area restaurants?  After seeing this on Check Please, Bay Area and realizing that this place was just around the block from my work, I was excited to try it. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the Blue Plate Special of crispy shrimp tacos and a cup of the pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos came with a side of pinto beans with small slices of avocado on top. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried shrimp inside the taco was extremely greasy, and the oil tasted stale. END
BEGIN NOW      There was absolutley no flavor in the shrimp taco unless you put the chipotle cream sauce on it. END
BEGIN NOW      The tortillas were homemade, fresh and declicious. END
BEGIN NOW      The pinto beans were bland and needed seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW      The pozole was good (served with fresh tortillas), but had way too much cabbage in it (it was basically cabbage with a little broth) and a few hominy kernels. END
BEGIN NOW      The taste of the broth was great, albeit a little too spicy for me (and I like hot). END
BEGIN NOW    Oh, I also had a chocolate chip cookie - which was tasty, but clearly just a Nestle Toll House cookie recipeOverall, I would not go back again. END
BEGIN NOW      I would rather have good, authentic street tacos from a taco truck then to have poorly done Mexican fusion. END
BEGIN NOW    Great for lunchCasual, airy spaceOrder at the counter and food arrives promptly at your tableChicken tacos are good. END
BEGIN NOW      Waitress thought we ordered the pork belly and she got super excited until we told her it was the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      So next time we'll have to try the pork belly and see what all the excitement was about. END
BEGIN NOW    Chips, salsa &amp; guacamole are also yummy as a filler. END
BEGIN NOW    Lunch special - two tacos &amp; agua fresca = $9Not a bad deal. END
BEGIN NOW    My bf and I thoroughly enjoyed our food at Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     We got the fresh tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole as well as the pozole. END
BEGIN NOW     The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful and we were happy with our selection. END
BEGIN NOW     The mimosas seemed to use fresh squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW      Five stars for the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Service-wise, there is room for improvement. END
BEGIN NOW     My bf and I both ordered pozole and his came out very nice, and mine looked very sloppy and missing the toppings that he got. END
BEGIN NOW     I value toppings more than he does, so I was very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      The waitress reluctantly offered to get me more toppings, but never returned. END
BEGIN NOW     My over-easy eggs also came out sunny side up and I had to request it to be corrected, luckily it came out fine. END
BEGIN NOW    Tacos here will cost you an arm and a leg but you are definitely paying for good quality products. END
BEGIN NOW     The pork belly tacos washed down with a horchata is highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW    Very good, very straightforward but surprisingly sophisticated Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW     Think more a casual, "Frontera Grill" than a "Chevy's". END
BEGIN NOW     You will not find everything slathered in cheese to the point of being a formless blob, bathed in a sea of refried beans. END
BEGIN NOW     The spices are the main draw, and it's fresh and fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW    It's counter service, and there are some great and affordable Happy Hour specials. END
BEGIN NOW     There's also a super cute, kinda flirty guy at the counter, which doesn't hurt either. END
BEGIN NOW     ;)Definitely coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW    We were there for dinner last night. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is interesting: trendy food court of Swan's market. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything we had was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     We've tried the fish tacos (delicious), the pork belly tacos (amazing), grilled squash with corn and pumpkin-seed chile (awesome) and the mango-kumquat salad (mmmmmh). END
BEGIN NOW     Their drink and desert menu is on the short side but gosh, the food is good. END
BEGIN NOW    I've eaten at Cosecha twice, now, and this second dining experience has really confirmed for me that this place is committed to homey, artisan like food with seasonal and fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the Blue Plate Special- fish tacos with a huge, savory bowl of black beans. END
BEGIN NOW      The beans alone were so perfectly seasoned and warm and tender with a lovely gravy/like sauce -- almost a really thick black bean soup. END
BEGIN NOW    The fish tacos were composed of pieces of fried cod, a sour cream chipotle sauce, one slice of jalapeño, and some cabbage in a corn tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW      Beautifully fried fish that had a very delicate and light texture. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was super excellent and friendly and very respectful-- really top notch service. END
BEGIN NOW      Furthermore, the young man who served me recommended their house hot sauce-- which was bright with a great kick. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambience is of an open air market; very comfortable and pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW      I am so lucky this place is two blocks from my office, and it's just perfect for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW    I really like the ambiance of this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Well, depends, I would imagine you may run into the occasional individuals who think they own the place because of their privileged lives (but that's another story). END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered the fish tacos here (comes with black beans and rice) along with the Chips and Guac. END
BEGIN NOW      For the beverage, I got the horchata latte which is pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The fish tacos, beans, and rice were pretty good but for $13 bucks, I cannot say it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      I must say though that the chips, salsa, and guac were very very good and I would pay the same amount for that item. END
BEGIN NOW      My bill came out to be about $22 bucks. END
BEGIN NOW      Service: I would like to thank the employee who brought the food to the tables, and also took our dishes away later on. END
BEGIN NOW      Very nice and courteous. END
BEGIN NOW      5 stars for him!Would I come back?  Maybe under the right circumstances but would not go out of my way to. END
BEGIN NOW    Ok the huevos cuahutemoc are solid!. END
BEGIN NOW    Great authentic mexican food! Ran into this place, I had the quesadillas best ones I have ever had at a restaurant! Homemade fresh tortillas! I will be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was excellent, atmosphere is hip. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered the yam and cheese quesadilla for the little ones and they enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the pork mole. END
BEGIN NOW      It was extremely too spicy and the chef provided me with something less spicy that I could share with the kids. END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha = Delicious beyond words I can't have enough type of food !!! Cosecha  is home to me :) I worked at Cosecha for lil over two years. END
BEGIN NOW     Even thoe I no longer work there I still come back to enjoy the food with out the work lol everything is so delicious full of flavor I could eat any plate but I must have to say my all time faves would be them shrimp tacos follow by some pork belly tacos it literally melt in your mouth and I can't forget about my mushroom quesadilla with pork. END
BEGIN NOW     If we talking brunch CHILAQUILES VERDES POR FAVOR !! but no matter what I get here it always need to come with a side of beens. END
BEGIN NOW     Those beans OMG I remember taking my lunch break and asking for a plate of beens with chicken, sour cream, pico de gallo, Guac and salsa verde sooo simple yet so amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     (To bad this is not a menu item :( sorry non workers of Cosecha) my now husband (boyfriend when I work at Cosecha ) LOVES them and he not a beens fan, for him me going to cosecha with out him is the end of the world. END
BEGIN NOW     He would be like "but you know I love cosecha " Indeed we do and not only do we love Cosecha but do we love even more its owner and chef Dominica with out her we wouldn't have Cosecha !! She's just amazing I don't know who is happier us when we go or her when she see us. END
BEGIN NOW     I would always go back to Cosecha no other food can compare. END
BEGIN NOW     I love recommending Cosecha because I know I would get that "OMG the food is amazing I can't wait to go back thank you " hahaha never fails. END
BEGIN NOW     I would deff bring my future kids for a kids quesadilla while sipping on a HORCHATA LATTLE I sure gone need that caffeine but it would be a treat as well :). END
BEGIN NOW    Cosecha is a really casual spot- you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp tacos were great, and the breakfast torta was hearty and delicious!Come early if you want the horchata latte- they were already out by 1:30 :( Well, come early in general. END
BEGIN NOW     They ran out of chips before we got there too. END
BEGIN NOW    Locally sourced ingredients with a focus on social justice. END
BEGIN NOW     She trained at Chez Panisse. END
BEGIN NOW     He's a professor at Cal State East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW     How could you not support this fabulous restaurant?!. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I grew up in Santa Ana and have traveled extensively throughout Mexico and Latin America and can say that the food here is quite authentic and definitely flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW    The green mole is fantastic and the handmade tortillas are a treat. END
BEGIN NOW     I highly recommend the queso fundido. END
BEGIN NOW    Great Mexican joint. END
BEGIN NOW     However, the portions are very small for a high price. END
BEGIN NOW     I would suggest the tortas, over the the tiny tacos ($3. END
BEGIN NOW    65) and pork belly tacos ($4. END
BEGIN NOW    50). END
BEGIN NOW     If you want good tacos for a reasonble price, head over to Mi Rancho taco truck on 1st ave and 14th street. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was good, can taste the quality. END
BEGIN NOW     Pricing for a shop like this was way off. END
BEGIN NOW     15 bucks for two tacos. END
BEGIN NOW    So let me start with what is good: the food is decent and the seating area is nice and good for large groups as you can order at the counter, share large tables, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     Staff are also kind. END
BEGIN NOW     That said, the PRICE IS BEYOND the far reaches of reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     $15 for two tiny tacos and a bunch of white rice (and no chips included) is totally incommensurate with the prices and portions of other high end counter-order taquerias in the area like picante or tacubaya, even accounting for the cost of special ingredients like shrimp, etc. END
BEGIN NOW    original review, September 2014 (update below):WOW. END
BEGIN NOW     I was expecting over-priced and small portions, after reading the gourmet menu -- But I got decent portions of gourmet served in sustainable to-go containers (no petroleum products, no plastic -- all recycled and compostable packages), for a reasonable price and very quickly. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered tacos and bean soup to go, on my way to an evening job. END
BEGIN NOW     It was served with a side of beans, rice and tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     I had enough for lunch the following day as well. END
BEGIN NOW     EVERY part of the order was outstanding -- The sauces, the garnish, the raw ingredients - all of the highest quality and absolutely delicious! Spicy enough to satisfy my preference for extra chili pepper. END
BEGIN NOW     I also appreciate the ambiance of the place -- I was expecting pretentious, but it's like an open cafeteria with several options and a communal eating area. END
BEGIN NOW     The server was quick and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW     I will be eating here regularly. END
BEGIN NOW      Genuine 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    ** UPDATE June 2015: I had to downgrade my initial 5-star rating to 4-star. END
BEGIN NOW     (See original review, above). END
BEGIN NOW     Unfortunately, the past several times I've visited Cosecha, the server has skimped on portions, with my containers of beans, rice, and guacamole only half-filled. END
BEGIN NOW     Come on, it's expensive enough with those little containers filled up. END
BEGIN NOW     I've noticed that I get more generous portions from certain servers, on certain days + times. END
BEGIN NOW     Less on others. END
BEGIN NOW     I wish it were consistent. END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    This place is overpriced for the food that you get. END
BEGIN NOW      Seems to follow the food truck trend. END
BEGIN NOW      Not recommended. END
BEGIN NOW    I give this spot a 4 due to service being slow. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered and waited for my drink for some time and funnily asked for it. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe the drink with meal is the norm. END
BEGIN NOW     The vibe is casual and cool but you will hit business lunches as well in full dress. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is a farm-to-table concept. END
BEGIN NOW     The tacos are tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     They use a single tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW     The braised beef has a dark, spiced sauce that was nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The chicken had great flavor as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't expect a massive menu. END
BEGIN NOW    Last time I was here, their special wasn't actually a deal, it was just an item from the menu that was featured and written on a board, but it wasn't cheaper or 'on special' in any way. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered it, and it said it came with cornbread, but it did not. END
BEGIN NOW     I asked and they said they were out of cornbread, although they did not offer to supplement with something else. END
BEGIN NOW     Small portions for a high price. END
BEGIN NOW    A really nice and open location, with ample seating and a friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried the crispy tacos special, which came with 2 crispy pork tacos (there's also a vegetarian option), pinto beans, and avocado salsa. END
BEGIN NOW     The tacos were actually pieces of pork wrapped in thick, fried taco shells. END
BEGIN NOW     I was disappointed that there wasn't any filling like lettuce or tomatoes, but the avocado salsa was so delicious I was fine just dipping my tacos in that. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely a new experience and fun to eat! The beans were very tasty as well. END
BEGIN NOW    Came back on a few other occasions and tried the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     The shrimp are HUGE (since they're wild caught) and super juicy/flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish tacos were a bit of a let-down. END
BEGIN NOW     I feel like the fish alone isn't flavorful enough to warrant a lack of fillings. END
BEGIN NOW     (All the fish tacos had were cabbage, sauce, and a sprig of cilantro) Overall, it's pretty pricy for the amount of food you get. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely not one of the cheapest options around, but I guess you need to pay for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW     And the wait during the lunch rush can be pretty long. END
BEGIN NOW    Had really good lunch here. END
BEGIN NOW    Prices are reasonable, but the atmosphere is very casual. END
BEGIN NOW     You order at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW    We shared the posole. END
BEGIN NOW     it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Lots of cilantro and it had some heat to it. END
BEGIN NOW     Might be too much for some people. END
BEGIN NOW    I had the crimini mushroom quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     It was perfectly grilled. END
BEGIN NOW     The salsa that came with it was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     And the guacamole was right on. END
BEGIN NOW     Right amount of spice and lime. END
BEGIN NOW    My SO's wild shrimp tacos were good. END
BEGIN NOW     Two fried shrimps in each taco. END
BEGIN NOW      But the side of beans was little bland. END
BEGIN NOW    Oh and we had a choc chip cookie, free for asking. END
BEGIN NOW     It was on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW    I would be definitely back. END
BEGIN NOW    When this place first opened I had the same complaints as some other reviewers here - high prices, small portions, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW      Here's the thing though:  This place has seriously upped its game over the past few months, to the point it is now cranking out some of the best food in the bay area. END
BEGIN NOW      No joke, this place is worth a special pilgrimage, especially on mole Monday. END
BEGIN NOW      The mole verde is just OUT OF THIS WORLD good. END
BEGIN NOW    I almost always get the blue plate special. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a reasonable sized portion and the food is just exquisite. END
BEGIN NOW      Sure it's a little pricier than most east bay tacquerias (more at an SF level), but the quality and sophistication of the food more than merit the (still very reasonable) price. END
BEGIN NOW      They make their own tortillas and all the ingredients are absolutely top notch. END
BEGIN NOW      The presentation is also really well done. END
BEGIN NOW    I like the set-up, too. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a particularly nice place to eat on a sunny day, with the open air feel and outside tables. END
BEGIN NOW    Finally, the service has gotten noticeably friendlier over the past few months. END
BEGIN NOW      A trend I hope will continue. END
BEGIN NOW    It was definitely time to upgrade my review to five stars. END
BEGIN NOW     I come here multiple times a week. END
BEGIN NOW     This is my neighborhood spot and I always feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     Love that the menu changes seasonally. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm not sure what happened to the people who got bad service because when I went the service was perfect and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I had dinner here on a Saturday night with my wife and we loved it, the location is great and historic the food was very good, fresh, great quality ingredients and good sized portions. END
BEGIN NOW    The homemade chips are fresh crispy and really tasty, the tortillas are handmade warm tender and awesome, the beans are really good overall just super good mexican food, I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW    I am excited to see restaurants taking a chance with mexican food and not doing the same old taqueria thing. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is decent. END
BEGIN NOW     Pricing of the tacos is a bit expensive. END
BEGIN NOW     The customer service could use improvement. END
BEGIN NOW     I will most likely not return due to the manner in which I was spoken to when I wanted modifications to my meal. END
BEGIN NOW    Love their shrimp taco and posole soup, love the food, love the ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are looking for a good heavy meal and unique beer in Oakland, the Hog's Apothecary is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a small neighborhood restaurant, that has an industrial tap house feel. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff was friendly and service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      I would not say the service was particularly fast or slow, but servers were attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      It seemed to feature mostly small local breweries (many I had never even heard of). END
BEGIN NOW      The variety of the beer selection was great and everything we tried was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW      I love trying new beer, especially from small California breweries, and I loved that this restaurant offered a wide variety of choices. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant does take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW     They seem to be busy while we were there so if you can get a reservation I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW      However (according to the website, only some of the restaurant can be reserved, so they also take plenty of walk-ins). END
BEGIN NOW      There are two TVs above the bar area, so If you are hoping to catch a game on TV they have you covered. END
BEGIN NOW     Our food was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     All of the small bites were great. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel was my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW     That alone could have been my meal. END
BEGIN NOW      The spicy mustard was GREAT, but spicy!! If you love horseradish you will LOVE this mustard (and its perfect with the buttery flavor of the pretzel). END
BEGIN NOW      I had the Titanic salad. END
BEGIN NOW      It was great and plenty of food for a main meal. END
BEGIN NOW      My husband had half dozen oysters and ribs and he had nothing but positives to say about that. END
BEGIN NOW      My only criticism about the experience was that the restaurant was very warm inside. END
BEGIN NOW      The windows were open but it didn't seem to provide much airflow. END
BEGIN NOW     Its a small space, so with the kitchen cooking and a full restaurant it can become uncomfortably warm. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, great beer, yummy food and nice people. END
BEGIN NOW      We will definitely go back. END
BEGIN NOW    Pros:  fast and friendly service           Food is hearty and good           Good beer selectionCons: food is very heavy . END
BEGIN NOW    but it's good. END
BEGIN NOW    First time dining here today. END
BEGIN NOW      Had reservations for Mother's Day. END
BEGIN NOW      We were seated quickly, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our waiter showed up. END
BEGIN NOW      I had been looking around, with pleading eyes, hoping maybe someone could take the time to get a mimosa started for a mom. END
BEGIN NOW      But no. END
BEGIN NOW      No water, nothing. END
BEGIN NOW      The place was still half empty. END
BEGIN NOW    The food was really good though. END
BEGIN NOW    My son ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits were kind of drowned in the gravy, so my son wasn't eating them. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked if he could have a dry biscuit and they said sure no problem. END
BEGIN NOW      Of course surprise when the bill came- they just had to charge us the $5 for the dry biscuit- which was about 15 cents of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      If they had warned us at the time they they weren't simply trying to help a customer be satisfied with their meal, and would be charging us, maybe I would not have been so annoyed. END
BEGIN NOW      But between the 20 minute wait for service and the nickel and diming, it left me not looking forward to a return. END
BEGIN NOW    If you care nothing about service, this place will be just fine. END
BEGIN NOW    Visited today 5. END
BEGIN NOW    4. END
BEGIN NOW    16 I was working from home today and my friend stopped by to visit me. END
BEGIN NOW     We got really hungry and decided to be adventurous and try a new place. END
BEGIN NOW     The hog's apothecary has been on my list for quite some time now. END
BEGIN NOW     I bookmarked it for their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     It was pretty empty for a Wednesday at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess it's to be expected. END
BEGIN NOW     Sadly, they didn't have the corn dog offered today at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I decided to get the trail park boy. END
BEGIN NOW     Their bread is good! The mortadella was new to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I liked it, a bit too salty. END
BEGIN NOW     Actually salt was a big problem with our meal here. END
BEGIN NOW     We share the supernova appetizer/starter. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a mixed green beet salad with herb crème fraîche. END
BEGIN NOW     It was so incredibly SALTY. END
BEGIN NOW     We kind of forced ourselves to eat it when we honestly should've just sent it back or just stopped eating it. END
BEGIN NOW     The only thing good about the salad was the toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW     My side salad that came with my sandwich was also wayyyy to salty. END
BEGIN NOW     I didn't even try to eat it. END
BEGIN NOW     We drank two jugs of water while we were there. END
BEGIN NOW     This place was pretty disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW     /: I wouldn't come back here unless it was to try their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent experience at this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Communal seating, sports TVs, great service, and gourmet artisan food. END
BEGIN NOW     Their products are quality, and so even though they're pricey, they are decently portioned. END
BEGIN NOW     They change their menu every day, so that's exciting. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun place in Oakland! I came here for dinner with friends after a day of drinking our way through Napa. END
BEGIN NOW    Outside, you'll be impressed with the big clean windows and inside, you'll find community tables and a menu with lots of beers. END
BEGIN NOW    and a surprising amount of hotdogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Most of my group went the hotdog route but I opted for the "Pride of Castroville" which was delicious with juicy artichokes. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun service, chill atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    Lively, quality gastropub that's helping to put the area around 40th Street and Broadway on the map as a new dining corridor in Oakland, with a feel and identity that's distinct from gentrified Piedmont Avenue not far away. END
BEGIN NOW    The first things you notice are the tremendous craft beer selection and the meat/pork-heavy menu. END
BEGIN NOW     As for the beer, the selection is quite extensive and although it features mostly craft brews, it looks like it's been curated to be very comprehensive across all major styles. END
BEGIN NOW     Moreover, if you have any questions about any single beer item, you could ask for a little taste, or you could ask for advice on what pairs well with certain dishes on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    And as for the menu, it is quite meat-heavy (although I assume some items may be vegetarian-friendly or can be made so). END
BEGIN NOW     While items like sausages might sound steep at around $13, the portion size is tremendous, and the case of the "Got Seoul" sausage that they offered recently, it comes topped uniquely with Asian ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     There are even meatier, more substantial entrees available too, all with whimsical names to them. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything is so meaty and delicious, you'll be "mmm"-ing with approval throughout the meal. END
BEGIN NOW    The overall atmosphere is quite friendly and festive, with lots of communal seating, and the place can be packed most of the time. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is also knowledgeable and friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW     Chalk up another win for the 40th Street area and for the Oakland dining scene. END
BEGIN NOW    Your typical hipster joint. END
BEGIN NOW     Bearded men, beer, beer snacks made in-house, pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW    Crater Lake Root Beer was delish. END
BEGIN NOW     Served in a metal cup with perfectly square ice cubes that don't get in the way, it has a refreshing but light sassafras taste. END
BEGIN NOW     It's $5 for about 10 oz. END
BEGIN NOW    Pretzel was pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW     The mustard was more like wasabi pretending to be mustard. END
BEGIN NOW     The malted mayo was brown mayo. END
BEGIN NOW    The space is pretty comfortable but service was okay. END
BEGIN NOW     No one came to our table for quite a while until we asked. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Hangar steak and eggs were perfectly rare and runny (respectively) and biscuits with friend chicken add-on was gooey and juicy (respectively)Draught iced coffee was strong without being overly bitter and creamy smooth cream. END
BEGIN NOW    Service was quick and attentive and just as hipster as one would expect. END
BEGIN NOW    A happy find in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Interesting selection of beers and tasty food. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the New York Reuben sandwich and was very satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW      The pastrami is almost shredded, which worked fine, and the flavor was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      Husband had the meatball sandwich and enjoyed it tremendously. END
BEGIN NOW      Freshly made potato chips were perfectly cooked. END
BEGIN NOW      We will happily go back anytime. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a very difficult place to decide whether it's a 3 or a 5 star. END
BEGIN NOW     I opted for 4 stars, and here's why. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance is beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW     The lighting is low and glowing, and extremely inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall setup of this restaurant is well thought out. END
BEGIN NOW     And they have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap; different local breweries with brief descriptions. END
BEGIN NOW     Their food is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a bit pricey for my wallet, but that's with the understanding the local (sustainable) farmers provide produce and meat. END
BEGIN NOW     And it's good. END
BEGIN NOW     Just beyond my budget for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW     I have a pretty decent job and all, but this is Oakland after all, and $25 entrees, no matter how high the quality of food, is just not within my budget of reasonable spending for a single entree, not including drinks, not including  my partner  or her  choice of food and beverage. END
BEGIN NOW     I will probably just stick to going there for some booze. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are great, the servers are somewhere between mediocre and great, and overall this business seems to have a lot of pride and it presents itself well. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely worth stopping by for a beer and scoping things out. END
BEGIN NOW     It's very inviting. END
BEGIN NOW    ** honorable mention, this is with respect to Jack R review. END
BEGIN NOW     Just wanted to make the argument that Jack's review is wildly inappropriate. END
BEGIN NOW     Not only is it borderline chauvinistic with his constant mention of how attractive the waitress was, but it's inappropriate with respect to how his failure to order left the waitress to awkwardly make suggestions and order food for him, that he later, somehow, "realized" he didn't know what she had ordered, and therefore he did not like it. END
BEGIN NOW     Went on to joke about how his friend nearly pushed the waitress into his lap, then complained about the food again. END
BEGIN NOW     You're a douche, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW     I think you should take your review down. END
BEGIN NOW     **. END
BEGIN NOW    My girlfriend and I went on a double date with two of our friends, and we had dinner at The Hog's Apothecary. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     This restaurant has communal tables which is something that I absolutely disdain. END
BEGIN NOW     As someone who has a busy schedule and is in a long distance relationship, my time with my girlfriend, my friends, and my family is precious to me. END
BEGIN NOW     When I finally get the time to spend with my self-selected company, I hate having to shout over strangers to avoid being drowned out by their own conversations. END
BEGIN NOW     That being said, the communal tables at Hog's were not nearly as cramped as the ones at Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW     You still have to do a lot of yelling though. END
BEGIN NOW     The hard wooden benches were pretty uncomfortable too. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything else about the restaurant was really great though. END
BEGIN NOW     They offer a preponderance of great local and semi-local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the Buddha's Hand IPA from Berryessa Brewing in Winters, CA, and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     It was not overly bitter and had a pleasant citrus taste from the Buddha's hand. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone else enjoyed their beers as well. END
BEGIN NOW    My girlfriend and I started our meal with a soft pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel had a rich, brown skin and was light and airy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed the spicy mustard dipping sauce that came with the pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The heat from the mustard hits you right in the sinuses (in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW    For our meal, we shared the corn dog and the Jamaican Me Crazy sausage. END
BEGIN NOW    Corn dog: Easily one of the best (non-State Fair) corn dogs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     However, I feel like corn dogs are kind of like donuts. END
BEGIN NOW     Awful ones are still pretty good, and even the best version with the best possible ingredients is only a few times better than the average ones. END
BEGIN NOW     Jamaican Me Crazy: The sausage was tasty, although the jerk seasoning could have been a little more bold. END
BEGIN NOW     I only tasted faint traces of allspice. END
BEGIN NOW     The bun pillow-soft and provided a textural contrast to the pop I would get when biting into the casing of the sausage. END
BEGIN NOW     The potato chips were tasty too. END
BEGIN NOW     While both items were really good, they do seem a little overpriced for what they are. END
BEGIN NOW    Our service was good, although there was some redundancy between the servers. END
BEGIN NOW     Several different people came around to take our orders and this led to some confusion when my girlfriend ordered a second beer and two of the servers mistakenly thought that the other one would get the beer. END
BEGIN NOW     They got it right eventually though. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, I like The Hog's Apothecary and would come back another time for beer and a corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Every time I pass by Hog's Apothecary, it's filled to the brim with customers. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu is filled with (overpriced) sausage options. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess it's their specialty, but no way in hell I am buying into gourmet hotdogs prices anymore. END
BEGIN NOW     I already think Rosamunde and Wurstkuche in LA are overhyped and overpriced so $12+ for a dog? I really don't think so. END
BEGIN NOW    Instead, I tried out the brunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW     At first look, everything is pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW     The servers are nice, the interior is open with long communal tables, and they have an extensive "hipster" beer list. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm on a Belgian kick lately for I get the two Belgian beers and they are both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     After we ordered the food, about 45 minutes have passed and we are already close to finishing our second beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The service is painfully slow. END
BEGIN NOW     In fact, I saw some other tables that came in after us getting their food first. END
BEGIN NOW     What's up with that?They see us get a bit antsy and assure us our food is coming out. END
BEGIN NOW     I receive my French Monsieur which is good, with a nice kick of Horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW     I also try the Apothecary Benedict and must admit, the house made ham is quite good. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything tastes pretty good but they are all pretty much heart attacks on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is definitely better than average but not enough to make me keep wanting to come back. END
BEGIN NOW     The problem with this place, and a bunch of other new hipster joints in Oakland, is that everything is "artisanal" but that doesn't mean it necessarily makes everything taste better nor does it justify the stiff prices. END
BEGIN NOW     There are too many places in Oakland which offers a good beer list and hipster food, but it's kind of getting out of hand. END
BEGIN NOW     What's next, $20 sausage made with baby dragon butt and foie gras? I digress but I didn't feel Hog's was a step above any other already existing places. END
BEGIN NOW     That's why I'll give it an A-OK. END
BEGIN NOW    We brought some of our fam here, because I mean it has hog in the name--- why wouldn't we? They only serve beer and wine, so don't expect a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu is a great mix of stuff to share and entrees. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered a mix of bar snacks, appetizers and one entree to share. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything was super tasty! The staff was super awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The one thing that I didn't like was the bench seating (I need a seat back when filling my belly) and there was no where to hang my jacket &amp; purse. END
BEGIN NOW      We will definitely go back here to try more of the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    My wife &amp; I decided to start out 2016 with brunch here today. END
BEGIN NOW      Brunch was quite busy today, so it was good that we made a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW      She started with a mimosa, while I had a pint of hefeweizen (a tough choice, as they have over 25 beers on draft). END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the chicken and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW      You can get either maple syrup or gravy with this order, but I recommend the syrup. END
BEGIN NOW      The onion waffle and fried chicken are very savory, so the sweetness of the syrup brings a nice balance. END
BEGIN NOW      They use boneless chicken thighs, so you can forgo utensils and just dig in with your bare hands!My wife ordered a benedict, which comes with the house pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW      The egg was cooked perfectly, but the dish (along with the house potatoes) were a little on the salty side. END
BEGIN NOW    We ordered a side of bacon to share, which could have been cooked a little longer. END
BEGIN NOW    The service was excellent:  attentive, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW      The place got pretty loud as it got crowded, but it was very festive for the holiday. END
BEGIN NOW    I was out Free Wheeling and I had a fresh Charge on my Ankle Bracelet . END
BEGIN NOW     Today was a good day to eliminate another Book Mark . END
BEGIN NOW    So I rolled to The Hogs Apothecary and Oaktown. END
BEGIN NOW    I rolled up and Parked right across the street . END
BEGIN NOW     No Parking Lot just Street Parking . END
BEGIN NOW    They also have Bike Parking right up front. END
BEGIN NOW     The Cool Thing is the Front Door Handles are Shaped like Giant Meat Cleavers. END
BEGIN NOW    I was Greeted upon Entering and  Grabbed  a Seat at the Bar. END
BEGIN NOW     The Furnishings are Very Sturdy and some of it is from Repurposed Materials very cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Their Bar Menu and Food Menu Change Daily . END
BEGIN NOW     They also Butcher a Whole Pig every Tuesday and they use every part in Meal preparation . END
BEGIN NOW    They have 2 LCD TVs for Sporting Events . END
BEGIN NOW    They also have a Nice Big Open Air Skylight . END
BEGIN NOW    Their Bartenders are a Wealth of Info . END
BEGIN NOW    They have several Micro Brews on Tap. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered a Whippersnapper -Southern English Style Brown Mild Ale . END
BEGIN NOW     I Liked It. END
BEGIN NOW    I then ordered a Chocolypto - Imperial Stout with Oatmeal and Cacao . END
BEGIN NOW     I really like this one it was Rich and Robust . END
BEGIN NOW    My Final Beer was Framboos / Batch 28 -Belgian Style Ale with Raspberries . END
BEGIN NOW     This is a Must Order very Flavorful and Fruity . END
BEGIN NOW    For Dinner I Ordered The Belgian Braise - House Butchered Pork Shoulder braised in Societe ale , heirloom grits , charred radish rapini  braising  jus ,hard herb- bread crumb salsa . END
BEGIN NOW    This was very good the Pork was so Tender it melted in my Mouth . END
BEGIN NOW     Yummy I also ordered a Corn Dog and it Came with House rendered Lard Fried Kennebec Potato Chips and Mixed Pickles . END
BEGIN NOW     This was also good . END
BEGIN NOW    My Servers were Very Nice and Prompt . END
BEGIN NOW     I Paid By Discover Card and Rolled out. END
BEGIN NOW    The fried chicken was piled high and looked scrumptious, but it was raw. END
BEGIN NOW      Not under done, not pink. END
BEGIN NOW      Gelatinously raw. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked that it be removed from the bill which they did, but I was surprised our server didn't seem more alarmed by the fact that raw chicken made it onto the plate. END
BEGIN NOW     This is fine if you like communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW    It took me awhile, but I finally got to try Hog's and for brunch, nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW    I came on a Saturday and there was a good crowd and we got seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW     I had one of their many beers on tap, though I don't recall which one. END
BEGIN NOW     I went with the Belgian Waffles with Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     The waffles were savory and the fried chicken was a must. END
BEGIN NOW     Otherwise, what's the point? The dish was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     Though the person I was with got the something else, it was very small for the price, even though my dish was a bit pricey as well. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't remember what he got, as it is not on the menu online. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is good and the service is good as well. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a place I would come to every once in a long awhile, but certainly worth a try. END
BEGIN NOW    I live down the street so I always end up here when I can't make a decision on what to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer selection and excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW     Menu is always changing, which is nice because I can always order something new. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender told us they base their menu off of what is available that day. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, service has always been super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    I should have ordered the Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    As good as that dish looked though (and as much as I wanted to try it), I knew I had to order something pork related. END
BEGIN NOW      After all, between Hog's Apothecary's name and their giant pig statue that hovered behind me, it'd practically be sacrilegious not to!  And I am not one to mess with the pork/bacon/pork belly powers that may be (all hail, Bacon!). END
BEGIN NOW    With a menu that is constantly changing, Hog's Apothecary has a lot to offer, even if the day's menu isn't super extensive - roughly a dozen starters and sides, a handful of sausages, and a few different entrées. END
BEGIN NOW      What's more, there's beer and lots of it. END
BEGIN NOW      With over 25 varieties on tap (mostly craft brews), you could even forgo eating and just sample beers all night long. END
BEGIN NOW    -- SPICY PORK CRACKLIN'S. END
BEGIN NOW    $3(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…)These cracklin's are crackin'!  Not only are they borderline addictive, but they really do pack some heat, as every piece is coated with a spicy, mouth-watering seasoning (don't forget the lime!). END
BEGIN NOW      What's more, the portion is quite generous!  A great starter for groups to share. END
BEGIN NOW    -- BOURBON-CHICKEN LIVER PATE. END
BEGIN NOW    $6(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…)Although larger slices of bread would have been nice to spread out all that pate, I'm not definitely not complaining about those giant gobs either!  While every bite was rich and decadent, the taste was also nicely accentuated by the sea salt and the berries. END
BEGIN NOW      If this isn't the best one I've had, it wouldn't be far behind. END
BEGIN NOW    -- SUPERFECTA SAUSAGE SANDWICH - Pork, Rabbit, Chicken, Tim's Brown Ale, Basque Chili &amp; Mild Herbs, Fennel-Onion Braise, Dijon Mustard. END
BEGIN NOW    $14(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…)The only blemish, but it was a big one. END
BEGIN NOW      I was hopeful for trio of meats in the sausage, but it wasn't even juicy, let alone flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      Ironically, the braise had the opposite effect, overpowering whatever flavor the meat had with fennel. END
BEGIN NOW      Sadly, besides the chips, the only other thing I enjoyed were the pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW    As underwhelming as my order was, it really was the only "bad" thing about my experience. END
BEGIN NOW      Great food otherwise, an awesome selection of beers, fantastic staff (they let our large party split our bill into smaller tabs), and (relatively) easy parking. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus, with several long tables, Hog's Apothecary is grew for groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW    Also, it's worth noting that the rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit (we all ordered different things), so it wouldn't surprise me if what I had just wasn't one of their better dishes. END
BEGIN NOW      Especially since the starters were really good. END
BEGIN NOW      Rounding up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I wonder what might have been if I had only ordered the fried chicken!. END
BEGIN NOW    4. END
BEGIN NOW    5 StarsProsA great variety of draft beers + a flight option Pretzel was easily shareable and well done Fun atmosphereChill staff ConsUmmmm can be pricey depending on your beer choice Overall ThoughtsWhile I enjoyed my experience with the beer I want to come back for the food to see if it can be bumped up that last half star!. END
BEGIN NOW    Order the meatballs (appetizer) and fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     They have tons of beer on tap!  I was in the mood for cider and they had 2 to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW    I can wait to come back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Such a gem!. END
BEGIN NOW    Will not be returning. END
BEGIN NOW     I give the ambiance, environment, resources (food and drink) a mediocre mark, nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW     It was the service I wasn't happy with. END
BEGIN NOW     I have not ever been talked to like that here in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     I brought my service dog and two friends and was felt less than welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW     Although we did get to sit down for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW     Our waiter, the bartender, Josh H, near beginning of dinner, was kind of an asshole to my friends and I. END
BEGIN NOW     He immediately had a tone upon first approach like he wasn't going to like us, asking about my small dog. END
BEGIN NOW     I told him we had already talked to the manager and were welcomed to sit down. END
BEGIN NOW     I felt like he would have told us to leave. END
BEGIN NOW    Josh came over to my friends and I to get our drink order. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend had a question which left much to be interpreted. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead of helping my friend out he insulted her by remarking "how all over the place" her question was. END
BEGIN NOW     I was floored. END
BEGIN NOW     I later asked for a glass of water. END
BEGIN NOW     Of course I had my dog in my lap away from others, I gave him a chance to drink out of the glass. END
BEGIN NOW     Josh comes out of nowhere and immediately rips the glass out of my hand and scolds me. END
BEGIN NOW     Stroke two. END
BEGIN NOW     We were all ready to leave by this point. END
BEGIN NOW     He returned with a paper cup of water for my dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Sweet? Hardly. END
BEGIN NOW     He also assumed we wanted separate checks when we did not. END
BEGIN NOW     Perhaps he was having a bad day but a first impression is a first impression bud. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible service. END
BEGIN NOW     Money is tight for most and I wouldn't waste a second try on somewhere that was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW     In order to harvest a community you should probably be more friendly to your locals and their pooches. END
BEGIN NOW     Word spreads fast. END
BEGIN NOW    It's currently SF Beer Week. END
BEGIN NOW      Like, I'm sad that I even had to work at all this week, but I need the money to taste the beer, so here we are. END
BEGIN NOW      Last night, the hubs and I met some good friends at the Hog's Apothecary as they were hosting brews from FiftyFifty Brewing. END
BEGIN NOW      I stalked the menu online, and many of their offerings are meat and pork and sausage and YES. END
BEGIN NOW      Our server was very friendly and very attentive. END
BEGIN NOW       A+Location - near (in?) Temescal in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      I hear this is a notorious hipsterville area. END
BEGIN NOW      No matter, this place is kinda by itself on a corner. END
BEGIN NOW      Walking in, there are picnic tables, so you sit community style with others. END
BEGIN NOW      There was a bar to my right, communal seating in the middle, and bar seating along the left edge. END
BEGIN NOW      I enjoyed the decor, but man, it's loud AF in there. END
BEGIN NOW      We were there in the evening, after 7pm and it wasn't super crowded, but it sounded like it. END
BEGIN NOW     We were fortunate enough to be able to move to a corner booth so we could hear our own conversation. END
BEGIN NOW     Beer - I sampled two beers and shite, I can't remember the name of the FiftyFifty beer. END
BEGIN NOW      It started with an M, if I remember correctly, and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Winner winner!  The second beer was the German Table Beer, a dark German session with wheat. END
BEGIN NOW      Also delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I wish it hadn't been a Wednesday night because I would've picked at LEAST three more to try. END
BEGIN NOW      The selection is superb. END
BEGIN NOW      Most of my stars are dedicated to this. END
BEGIN NOW    Food - We ordered the Snack Bar and split among us four. END
BEGIN NOW      I think it's a good bang for your buck. END
BEGIN NOW      You get a HUGE fresh soft pretzel, house made corn nuts, olives, and pork cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything on that platter was delicious, though I feel as though the cracklins were a little stale. END
BEGIN NOW      Could've just been me. END
BEGIN NOW      Hubs and I split the Steph Currywurst. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a good portion for one person. END
BEGIN NOW      That was my bad. END
BEGIN NOW      Not too overwhelming with the curry flavor, with nice pickled onions and chips on the side. END
BEGIN NOW      I left needing something else though. END
BEGIN NOW    I took away a star due to price. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, the selection is great. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is well thought-out and complementary to the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      It was pricey for me though (see 1st paragraph). END
BEGIN NOW      A sausage dog, although delicious was $14. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, still a good place. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd come here again on a semi-full stomach to sample more beer. END
BEGIN NOW    Great brunch place! Friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     Sat at the bar and was served by a cool guy from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW     A wide variety of beer on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     The Royale with Cheese was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The oysters were sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     I will definitely return to try the pumpkin pie donut holes!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you want a sausage and beer, this is definitely the place to be! Also, if you're a giant hipster, go here:) the quality is excellent, the vibe is trendy (in all it's dark wood and metal accents, with some great pops of corrugated metal at the bar). END
BEGIN NOW    This place is a major thumbs up, bring your friends and it'll be a great time!. END
BEGIN NOW    I am glad I like this place because it's literally across the street from me. END
BEGIN NOW     Be aware it gets PACKED and it's really not the place to just drop in for a beer on the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     They are really particular where you sit too so aside from the bar you must check in with the host/hostess. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is good however a bit overpriced but the pretzel is huge and very reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW     But you're really coming her for the beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Let me say that again-- the beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW     A ton of time goes into crafting this and you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone working there knows a ton and will recommend and let you tastes everything first. END
BEGIN NOW     I miss the little shuffle board they used to have but they totally needed the space given how popular Hog's has become. END
BEGIN NOW     It's great for the neighborhood and I am a big fan. END
BEGIN NOW    Bacon. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     Fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     Millions of local brew on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     This man I know, who I call Lester, not his real name, of course, who is from the great state of Iowa, would have loved this place like hog in mud. END
BEGIN NOW     My pre-race meal. END
BEGIN NOW     It was very children friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I unfortunately was having a discussion with my dining partner about why men always cheat when a young couple with young children sat down. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes it was a communal table style. END
BEGIN NOW     So conversation of controversy could be overheard. END
BEGIN NOW     Though I should not apologize for we have freedom of speech here and plus I know I am right. END
BEGIN NOW     I am the confession chamber to many guy friends who cheat but feel guilty. END
BEGIN NOW    Social commentary aside, this is kind of restaurant that serves the food for the people. END
BEGIN NOW     Basic yet upscale. END
BEGIN NOW     Possibly the best fried chicken with collard greens I have ever eaten. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the pork shoulder with grits, delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretzel with two kinds of gourmet mustard, yum. END
BEGIN NOW     But, the most surprising thing was the apple and celery root soup called fruit and root soup. END
BEGIN NOW     Creamy, yes, but also very light and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     Very girlie dish I think. END
BEGIN NOW     I think the sausages looked great. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to come back to try the local brew. END
BEGIN NOW     Very fashionable. END
BEGIN NOW     This place felt a bit Midwestern and a bit of the South, and slightly Brooklyn. END
BEGIN NOW     Oakland is having a moment. END
BEGIN NOW     I sort of kind of want to share my finds with everyone. END
BEGIN NOW     Time to make some new friends so I can show them how Oaklanders do food. END
BEGIN NOW    We arrived early for our reservation so sat at the bar where we enjoyed some of the amazing beers they have on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     The service and atmosphere was so great we decided to just fine at the bar and what a treat. END
BEGIN NOW     We had bar snacks of olives and spicy pork crackling - both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     Next the chickfritz which made me wish I could cook so well. END
BEGIN NOW     For our main we shared the shrimp and grits - let's say I had to strongly resist licking the plate! Final course was the pumpkin and pretzel donuts with a custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll admit to drinking what was left of the custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     The donuts themselves were packed with flavor and delightfully moist. END
BEGIN NOW     Finally did I mention the beer selection? Great choice of local small brews, many of which I love so glad Hogs supports them. END
BEGIN NOW     I will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Wasn't impressed with the food or service,but the place looks nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW    This area is infested with hipsters and there's nothing to complain about that. END
BEGIN NOW     This restaurant is exactly what this area needed! Craft beer galore. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a more intimate hipster place with cafeteria tables and a bar stools all around (they really want you to start talking to the strangers). END
BEGIN NOW     What I lovvvvveeee is the style and the Devore of this place. END
BEGIN NOW     The plentiful of windows and the high ceilings. END
BEGIN NOW     It really comfortable here. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a huge selection of craft beer all over the east Bay Area as well as out of town beers. END
BEGIN NOW    For now I only tried their hot dogs and pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel was good! Nice and soft and really big enough for two. END
BEGIN NOW     Just AVOID dipping a huge piece into their yellow home made mustard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     It taste like wasabi. END
BEGIN NOW     As for the hotdog, Jamaican Jerk Off. END
BEGIN NOW     It was ok. END
BEGIN NOW     The Bun broke off cause it was so soft. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausage was good. END
BEGIN NOW     The vegetable they added on top didn't chop off well with the bite. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean it's a hot dog, so simple but they made it so complex that it was hard to understand why. END
BEGIN NOW     I would come back again for the beer for sure. END
BEGIN NOW    Went there again recently and was actually amazed by the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Had mussels and some kind of fabulous salad and vegetable fritter thing. END
BEGIN NOW     It was so fresh, interesting and delicious! (Yes. END
BEGIN NOW     I licked the plate. END
BEGIN NOW    ) Sometimes it's just a matter of respecting your own culinary boundaries and finding the right thing to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     And of course, enjoying The Hog's creative and excellent execution. END
BEGIN NOW    Not sure what's going on but we have been sitting here for 30 minutes! We came in and the waitress took our beer order. END
BEGIN NOW     10 minutes later got our beers! She never came back walked around helping all 10 people in the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Trying to flag her down no eye contact smh. END
BEGIN NOW     Well at least my dead canary is good. END
BEGIN NOW     oh boy she walked by again!! Check please I guess we can't try the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Let me change it to one star even ride when asking for the check!!. END
BEGIN NOW    I came here during restaurant week and it was pretty busy. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was great and the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent beer selection Slowish service, only had maybe 1 or 2 waitstaff for a  busy Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     I was going to order the corn app but thankfully I was told it was essentially corn nuts. END
BEGIN NOW    Pistachio mortadella was goodPork  crackling was deliciousShrimp grits were absolutely fantasticCorn dog was extremely dissapointing, the breading fell apart and wasn't crispy or thick enough and the sausage was bleh. END
BEGIN NOW    Sorry, but don't believe the hype. END
BEGIN NOW     Although Hog's is a guiding light for the Temescal gentrification movement, the service is kind of pretentious dudes old timey haircuts and ironic t-shirts, the food is meh, and the vibe is kind of wack. END
BEGIN NOW     Thanks for the $7. END
BEGIN NOW    50 beer and microwaved pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     Wah-wahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW    You know, I found the menu very hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe I went at the wrong time of the day? But we were only offered a bar menu and it was not straight forward. END
BEGIN NOW     I felt almost intimidated trying to figure out why we had to de-code it. END
BEGIN NOW     We had to ask the waitress a few times what is what and how we get what we want. END
BEGIN NOW     She seemed at awe why we would ask suchhhh questions but then she served us marinated olives from a MASON jar. END
BEGIN NOW     That was when I figured out we were going to be spending money on cool instead of food, so we nibbled and left. END
BEGIN NOW     I may or may not stick my head in another time, just to see if their regular dinner menu will not be served on burlap or a birds nest. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant itself is very pretty though!. END
BEGIN NOW    I went here with two of my friends for Oakland Restaurant Week; unfortunately, we came at dinner and the offer was not available! Bummer! You walk in, and there is a bar, benches (Biergarten status), and stools around the edges. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor was nice and even featured a giant hog. END
BEGIN NOW     FOOD: We got the meatball appetizer and I got the Extras sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends got the Area 51 and the Kielbasa. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     The food comes with freshly made chips and pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips were HEAVILY salted that I felt that it was just not good. END
BEGIN NOW     Please hold back on the salt. END
BEGIN NOW     Veggies were fine. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausage combo itself was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     DRINK:I got a double IPA. END
BEGIN NOW     The place has a lot of beer options and are constantly rotating with choices, so beer options are great here. END
BEGIN NOW     SERVICE: I was pleased with the service. END
BEGIN NOW     Our waitress was attentive, but nothing spectacular, but our food and drinks come out in within a reasonable amount of time. END
BEGIN NOW     Although, she took away our full water pitcher and gave it to another party. END
BEGIN NOW     I was confused, but mistakes like that happen. END
BEGIN NOW     OVERALL:To sum it up, very expensive, which probably is why it's 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     For what I ate, the quality, and all, I don't see how I can justify $14 for a "sandwich" (a hot dog). END
BEGIN NOW     We were content with the place at the end of the night, but believed the price and quality disparity was too big. END
BEGIN NOW    I changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW     (after my last visit)Smarmy host. END
BEGIN NOW     Over priced food. END
BEGIN NOW     Yacky, pretentious &amp; droning hipster wannabes. END
BEGIN NOW     It's downright annoying. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not going back. END
BEGIN NOW     'tis a shame. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW    oh well. END
BEGIN NOW    Great place to get a drink, and the food (at least, our pretzels) is great! They have a large variety of beers. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the red flight, everyone else had lighter beers. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer and the pretzels were all amazing!. END
BEGIN NOW    Quick stop for a snack before heading out to a late dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selections were pretty impressive! Decided to try the Hock &amp; Trotter Terrine - could use a bit of seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW     The flavors didn't mix in together as well as we expected it to. END
BEGIN NOW     Still overall satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW    Despite passing by this place several times on my trek to Piedmont, I had never set foot in The Hog's Apothecary until this evening. END
BEGIN NOW     I had always felt a tad bit put off by the name, as I am a strict vee-gan. END
BEGIN NOW     Their menu didn't seem to be very veg-friendly (rather, not at all). END
BEGIN NOW     However, my friend Lindsey (also a veg) brought me here, and I thought it was pretty neat, as far as bars go. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried the Societe beer flight this evening ($10), which featured tantalizing names for each brew: The Harlot, The Debutante, and The Widow. END
BEGIN NOW     All three of the beers hailed from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was a touch unfriendly, but I've come to expect that same surliness with hipster locales in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW     The dining area and bar were both pretty jam-packed, so the host placed us, standing, at a counter by the window. END
BEGIN NOW     The server seemed to dislike this placement, but where else were we to go? I think I would have bumped this one up to a 5 if the staff had took initiative and found us a table. END
BEGIN NOW     Even so, at the end of the day, all of the beers I tasted were delicious, and I would definitely return to sample more of their cold beverages. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambiance here is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer is delicious and food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzels with wasabi mustard sauce really opens your airway and taste so good. END
BEGIN NOW    Been here for lunch and dinner now and it's been great!  The menu is limited but with enough choices and diversity for everyone to be able to find something. END
BEGIN NOW      Extensive beer menu but I dont think liquor. END
BEGIN NOW      Seating is communal on some tables to be ready to rub elbows with a stranger. END
BEGIN NOW      Looking forward to going back as they update their menu. END
BEGIN NOW    Loudest restaurant I've ever been in making the experience uncomfortable right as it began. END
BEGIN NOW      The cracklins were chewy, not really crunchy, and didn't have any pork flavor to it. END
BEGIN NOW      The terrine was too subtle and came on bread which tasted like it was a day old. END
BEGIN NOW      My Versace sausage was one of the better ones I've had, well seasoned and juicy with a good kick, served on a soft bun which tasted kind of like a Hawaiian roll. END
BEGIN NOW     The potato chips were fine but nothing special, reminds me of in-n-out fries which are "more fresh" but also just don't taste as good as other stuff you find. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall a pretty average meal in an unpleasant setting. END
BEGIN NOW    Wow! Literally the best benedict I ever had, and from a gastropub no less. END
BEGIN NOW      The meat was amazing and the egg was perfectly poached. END
BEGIN NOW      Excellent job! And I'm typically someone who is very particular with it comes to breakfast (I have a sous vide at home so it's hard to beat sous vide eggs). END
BEGIN NOW      Plus great beer selection on top of that!. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a nice lunch here with a mimosa and a "Vietnamese" sausage sandwich with an egg on it. END
BEGIN NOW     quite good. END
BEGIN NOW     You sit at communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe next time we come here for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    We came back for dinner to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (dropped in without a reservation) and in almost no time at all, we were seated in the exact same place as our first visit back in July. END
BEGIN NOW     We had the same server, AND she remembered us! Pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The blue cheese stuffed figs are not on the menu currently but they make some damn good steak (with blue cheese BUTTER!!! WOWWWW) and fries. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved looking around the restaurant while we were eating and seeing how the staff all interacted with each other - laughing, talking, and at one point I looked up in time to see someone down half a glass of beer. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't mean to imply they're unprofessional; rather I get the impression that people that work here love being around each other and working together in an environment that they enjoy, which definitely makes for a fun dining experience. END
BEGIN NOW     If we lived closer (and made a bit more money) I'd want to be regulars. END
BEGIN NOW    Seriously guys, if you're ever in the area, skip the crowds waiting outside Homeroom (although I also love that place) and just go about a block up for some of the best dishes in the east bay. END
BEGIN NOW    Brunched here twice and the food has been delectable:Softshell crab Benedict - I snapped that up the moment I saw it, and so glad I did because it wasn't on the menu the next time I went here!  It was just as good I imagined it would be, plus the potatoes on the side were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    Savory waffle + fried chicken - I had this with both gravy and syrup, and really it should be done no other way. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried chicken was boneless (all the easier to inhale you with, my dear), moist on the inside, crunchy but not greasy on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffles were cornmeal-y, also with the perfect amount of crispness most becoming of a waffle. END
BEGIN NOW      Have this dipped in syrup, and then the next bite smeared with gravy, then a bite of chicken, and so forth. END
BEGIN NOW      I can guarantee the couple next to you who hasn't gotten their entrees yet will be slightly uncomfortable at you and your spouse's eating moans. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      I would say in the summer be prepared for a cold drink along with everything else. END
BEGIN NOW    Waltzed in here with a reservation for 2, just in case, on a Sunday morning for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Upon first observation, this place is bright, open and cute!! Community tables for the social people and a few private tables for people like me. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend opted for the Pastrami Benedict with Schmaltz Potatoes and I went for the Fried Chicken and Spring Onion Waffles with Huckleberry Jam. END
BEGIN NOW     Let's not forget the mimosas, a brunch requirement. END
BEGIN NOW     Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     That is all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW     Hands down best chicken and waffles I've had so far. END
BEGIN NOW     And I've had a lot. END
BEGIN NOW     No bones! I'm all about bones and meat handles but you know there be places that give you only skin and bones. END
BEGIN NOW     Just meat baby. END
BEGIN NOW     Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm salivating just thinking about it. END
BEGIN NOW     And those schmaltzy potatoes?! I stole them off my friends plate. END
BEGIN NOW     So damn good. END
BEGIN NOW     That flavor! I can't get over this place!. END
BEGIN NOW    This is one of our go-to brunch spots in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is great and we love the space with beautiful light big community tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Some of our favorites include the French Madame, the schmaltzy potatoes, the Royale with cheese. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is always friendly, great customer service. END
BEGIN NOW    Hipster is probably the best way to describe this place. END
BEGIN NOW     The concept, the staff, the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     This is something that you would expect in Portland - but none of this is necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend up in Oakland had reached out to me, and while looking at reviews for the Trappist, a mention about the Hog's Apothecary caught my eye. END
BEGIN NOW     Fortunately the place was a few blocks from my friend and close to my sister. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend has wanted to try this place, and I was curious. END
BEGIN NOW    We showed up to standing room only - a good sign. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend put her name down with a 30 minute wait, and we found a space to look over the beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Really impressive, local menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Some things I've tried, but there was plenty that I had never even seen before. END
BEGIN NOW     Started with the 1903 Pre-Prohibition Style American Lager, which was delicious, and intelligently the beers got added to the menu tab for when we sat. END
BEGIN NOW    Not even 10 minutes later we got a seat. END
BEGIN NOW     Other than the bar, the place features long tables with benches. END
BEGIN NOW     Herein lies the one of problem I see with this place: getting in and up from these benches if you have a middle seat and they are already packed. END
BEGIN NOW     I eventually maneuvered in, but it wasn't easy. END
BEGIN NOW    The possibly daily-changing menu was confusing to say the least. END
BEGIN NOW     I still have no idea what Arlo Shirks or Olin Browns are. END
BEGIN NOW     I get it, hipster. END
BEGIN NOW     But don't make things difficult on your servers and the patrons - call shit out, like everything else on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    Regardless, I went the sausage sandwich route that the person sitting next to me also did: a Darkwing (duck and pork sausage with some kind of delicious greens on top) and the fried grits side. END
BEGIN NOW     The Darkwing was delicious and hearty, the chips very flavorful, as were the white veggie side. END
BEGIN NOW     The fried grits were also delicious, but the sausage was big enough that I barely got a dent into the grits. END
BEGIN NOW    Before leaving my friend and I each ordered one of the daily flights: she went with wheat, I went with hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW     The Daphne was delicious, but definitely more on the crisp summer day variety of hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW    I could definitely see coming back, and if I lived in the area, the beers alone might make this a recurring stop. END
BEGIN NOW     Some of the entrees are a bit on the pricey side, but fortunately there are some cheap options so you don't break the bank. END
BEGIN NOW    Great food and rotating taps. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is also wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW      I visit often and love their brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW    A certain someone wanted to try this place for over 4 months now. END
BEGIN NOW    Here we are at this place with all the open space in the world, but to only see two communal tables in the middle of the room and bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW      Trying to squeezed us into the edge of the communal table (H-E-L-L to the NO!). END
BEGIN NOW     We opted to wait for the bar stools instead. END
BEGIN NOW    With minimal selections, we nibble on some chickpea fritters and meatballs before scarfing down our Moroccan lambs sandwich and hot dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Nothing spectacular about the food when all you're given was some pickles and potato chips to go along with your meal. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not looking to return to this place but maybe one day along the line. END
BEGIN NOW     In fairness, their service was on point and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Solid food, great atmosphere and interesting beer list. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel is a must. END
BEGIN NOW     Sausages are good. END
BEGIN NOW     Fried chicken is good. END
BEGIN NOW     Totally worth while. END
BEGIN NOW     Though I dig it it's not a place that's like a total package for me meaning I would suggest it, but I wouldn't go outta my way to go there. END
BEGIN NOW     It is for sure one of the better spots in that few block radius - not that there are many. END
BEGIN NOW    Went "cheap" with the Corn Dog ($8) and asked for a recommendation for the 3 small Charcuterie items. END
BEGIN NOW     The waitress recommended the Pork Terrine ($6). END
BEGIN NOW    The terrine comes with toasted slices of Barkada baguette, whole grain mustard, pickle, and olive (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW     Despite having visible herbs it was pretty bland on it's own and definitely needed the mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW    The Corn Dog was superb. END
BEGIN NOW     It's huge and served with lard-y chips, pickles, ketchup and yellow mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW     Strong smokey flavor from the hot dog. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips were all crisp, an improvement from my last visit. END
BEGIN NOW    They need to beef up the little skewer you can see on the left side of my picture. END
BEGIN NOW     I first picked the corn dog up with that and it immediately bent and cracked under the weight of the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Went to check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was okay but service was bad. END
BEGIN NOW    Duck was dry. END
BEGIN NOW     Nothing special about the fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     Meatballs were great!!But our server, maybe she was having a bad day, but really inattentive. END
BEGIN NOW      She never came and checked in if I wanted another beer. END
BEGIN NOW     When taking our order she literally left before my friend placed his order. END
BEGIN NOW     She took my order then turned around and left as he was about to place his order. END
BEGIN NOW     He had to track her down and give her his order. END
BEGIN NOW     And she never returned to check how our meals were. END
BEGIN NOW     It became comical but she was not a good server. END
BEGIN NOW     I wasn't impressed enough to return. END
BEGIN NOW     Think it's a lot of hype. END
BEGIN NOW    Here's the thing: the food is sadly only 2-2 and a half stars, but the excellent service bumps it up to three stars. END
BEGIN NOW     1) the fried chicken was covered in gravy. END
BEGIN NOW     Like too much and took away from the crispness. END
BEGIN NOW     No flavor to the batter really and kinda bland. END
BEGIN NOW     Meh. END
BEGIN NOW     2) the corn dog- gf got it and I tried. END
BEGIN NOW     Also just not as good as it looked. END
BEGIN NOW     3) fried pickle appetizers were solid though. END
BEGIN NOW     4) great beer selection I will confirm. END
BEGIN NOW    I was sooo excited to try HA. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm so disappointed that our experience left us irritated &amp; disgusted. END
BEGIN NOW     There was literally 4 other patrons there when we walked in at 5:25pm. END
BEGIN NOW    at 5:30 dinner started &amp; 5 more parties walked in. END
BEGIN NOW    we got outta there at 6pm with NO food order since EVERYONE got service before we did. END
BEGIN NOW     I was appalled no one even stopped by to check how we were doing with our beer that was ordered at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Funny enough there was a black guy at the bar that was there before we got there that no one was checking on either!!!! The food smelled so good but they weren't getting another cent from me. END
BEGIN NOW    they went outta their way to avoid making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW      Make sure you look hipster enough if you want any service from Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW    you just messed with the wrong ONE!. END
BEGIN NOW    Super yummi y'all! Best fired chicken I ever had (albeit probably the smallest portion). END
BEGIN NOW     Their Wiener schnitzel was incredible and I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW    This place has an incredible beer list. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selector knows their stuff. END
BEGIN NOW     Always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I live fairly close to this spot so I frequent this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Hogs does not have anything I eat ( because I'm vegan) but the service, ant the staff are great, so I come anyways. END
BEGIN NOW     My man loves their sausages and I just like the place. END
BEGIN NOW     Good beer and great staff and I like the design of the place. END
BEGIN NOW    Was looking forward to trying this place as I like beer and pork, and it's within walking distance to my home. END
BEGIN NOW      Came with a small  group on a very quiet night (maybe 6 or 7 customers besides us), but was underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a good beer and intended to eat, but was put off by the service. END
BEGIN NOW     Example: When I asked the guy behind the bar if a certain beer was good, rather than a friendly "Yes", and maybe describing it, he just dryly said "Define good". END
BEGIN NOW      Really? You're gonna just throw it back at the customer with two words to prove how cool and indifferent you are?More than one examples of dickish attitude meant we left after one beer each, and a tab that was less than 1/5 of what was likely as we intended to stay for more beers and dinner, but I guess they "won" because they seemed intent on not making us feel welcome and they achieved it. END
BEGIN NOW    In the Yelp listing, it says "Ambience: Hipster" and that's accurate. END
BEGIN NOW      Judging from the snarky/snotty service, it seems they Hog's Apothecary thinks that's a compliment. END
BEGIN NOW     In my experience, even hipsters don't like to think of themselves as such. END
BEGIN NOW     (Are there really people out there who say, "Hipster? I'm there!")This place needs to get over itself and act like they're happy you're there. END
BEGIN NOW      The fact that they don't bother to respond to their Yelp reviews seems to be another example of them thinking they're too cool to care. END
BEGIN NOW    When you see the word "apothecary" in their name, you just know it's gonna be hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      So much so, that I kept feeling like I was in a Portland joint. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe it was the drizzle outside, maybe the multiple sightings of flannels and beards, whatever it may be, I was down with it. END
BEGIN NOW      This place is simple yet legit. END
BEGIN NOW      A new American Beer Hall is how they deem themselves and I like it. END
BEGIN NOW    Started with a black beer mixed with pinot noir from Moonlight in Santa Rosa and it was super unique. END
BEGIN NOW      Not bad but not something I would want multiples of. END
BEGIN NOW      You can definitely taste the wine. END
BEGIN NOW      Noshed on their bar ready *spicy* pork cracklings and they were incredibly light and sticky on the tooth. END
BEGIN NOW      And spicy was a bit of an understatement, it stung like a mutha. END
BEGIN NOW      I suppose they want you to order another beer. END
BEGIN NOW    A salad of tender butter lettuce, chopped beets, hipster rainbow radishes and a nice blue cheese dressing is a nice starter. END
BEGIN NOW      At $10 it is quite spittable. END
BEGIN NOW    Zsa Zsa $14 is an amazing sausage sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW      A Hungarian style which is like a kielbasa on steroids. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't know if they make their own sausage but this was one helluva meat specimen in tube form. END
BEGIN NOW      It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      Unique toasted bread, a fresh herb/oil spread and thick cut potato chips. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh I'd grow a hipster beard for this if I could, but I can't, so darn it to hell. END
BEGIN NOW    Hanger Steak $26 was spot on bistro fare. END
BEGIN NOW      Tender bloody meat, blue cheese sauce, sautéed greens and potato gratin. END
BEGIN NOW      Very assertive flavors and if you love beef, this will not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW      Only thing was it came out lukewarm and within a minute it was basically cold. END
BEGIN NOW      But now with a dry hopped steam beer from Petaluma, all was good. END
BEGIN NOW    Like the hood, like the brews, like the staff and like the food. END
BEGIN NOW      What's not to like?!  This place is a total score. END
BEGIN NOW    I am adding an update because I received a note from one of the other bartenders that I have never experienced and he told me to come back when he was working and apologized for the bad experience I had. END
BEGIN NOW    I stopped in late for an after climbing beer and saw that he was behind the bar so I went in. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a delicious beer, drank my beer and went on my way. END
BEGIN NOW    I was impressed and very pleased by his service and have gone back twice when I see he is working. END
BEGIN NOW     He is definitely the gem of that place and like going in for a late night beer when he is working!. END
BEGIN NOW    The beer selection is excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      The food, unfortunately, is mediocre and overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd be there more often if the waiters weren't so snotty and on top of you. END
BEGIN NOW      They'll get very pissy if you don't order food, even if it's early evening and the place is barely half full. END
BEGIN NOW    I want to love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I live a block away away and I want to come, all the time, and to love it. END
BEGIN NOW     However, due to the poor service I've received on more than one occasion and the clear lack of vegetarian/vegan options I feel forced to give a less than satisfactory review. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm usually fine with ordering the hot pretzel, which to be fair is awesome, and having one (or two or three) of the amazing beers available, and call it an excellent night. END
BEGIN NOW     However, on more than one occasion, I've experienced snobby and/or snarky service, which I find quite uncool (I've worked in customer service for over 20 years and know what it's like to give and receive genuinely warm, welcoming, and helpful service). END
BEGIN NOW    I'll start with the good-often times I've had great servers who were attentive, polite, and top-notch. END
BEGIN NOW     I've had numerous fantastic beers and beer suggestions and a handful of excellent salads and desserts. END
BEGIN NOW     However, more than once I've come across employees who were were way less than helpful, and at times, snarky. END
BEGIN NOW     Boo. END
BEGIN NOW    Me on a Friday night around 6pm: "Hi, I'd love to grab a quick drink"Hostess (with warmth of of a rock): "There's no room at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    "Me: "Oh, see there's a spot by the window, can I take that [which they let me have any other night of the week]?"Hostess: "Some people are waiting for those. END
BEGIN NOW    "Ok, I can't have a quick beer in the meantime? You can't say in a friendly tone, 'you're welcome to wait until something opens up. END
BEGIN NOW    ?'Frustrated, I left and decided to go across town where I felt more welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     I drove by about 15 minutes later (on my way to said place a cross town), and there was still no one in the seat I had asked for (I could see from the huge windows) Glad you keep it for them! (I would have been done, paid, and and out of the seat by then). END
BEGIN NOW    My next experience: on a Sunday night in which I sit at the bar then ask the bartender if any of the sides are vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW     His reply: "Have you seen the name of this place? We can always make you a vegetarian plate if you wish. END
BEGIN NOW    " Thanks, but why the need for a snarky opening? I could reply, and did: you are a business in vey hipster neighborhood full of vegans and vegetarians. END
BEGIN NOW     It's unfortunate that you're not more friendly to those diets. END
BEGIN NOW     He has the audacity to debate with me, which is when I start writing this review. END
BEGIN NOW    On a positive note, when I'm done with my beer the seemingly manager apologizes for any negativity and offers to pay for me beer. END
BEGIN NOW     Thanks buddy! You've kept the door open for another chance. END
BEGIN NOW    Give 'en a try if you're there for a full, non-vegetarian dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     You may really like it! And, if they shape up a bit and tune in to their local clientele and the general requests of their customers, I'll be back on a regular basis. END
BEGIN NOW    Great service and awesome food. END
BEGIN NOW     Have to admit that I was a bit weary going here with all the reviews about too cool for school hipster servers and I am happy to report that hipster is the only true adjective. END
BEGIN NOW    We were a group of five plus one baby and they were very accomodating, making sure that we had the right spot where the kiddo wouldn't be knocked over. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     We scarfed down the soft pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW      Fried chicken was good but not amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     True to the name, anything with a casing is worth ordering and order one of everything!. END
BEGIN NOW    I think the food is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW      I have been known to be a less than adventurous eater so i must point out that everything I have had has had me in awe. END
BEGIN NOW      Love love the always rotating, fresh craft brew selection and they have a couple wines that are de-lish as well as a sparkling for those not into beer. END
BEGIN NOW    I must comment on the 2 star review:  You went to an establishment practically named "pork incorporated" and were surprised at the lack of vegetarian options?  And they preceded to tell you they are always happy to make a vegetarian friendly dish on order (I've overheard them offer this to people and thought that was very accommodating!) and you are still less than thrilled with their service?  And if the local clientele is not being represented with such an establishment, then why are they packed regularly and why did another butchery restaurant open just up the block?. END
BEGIN NOW    Finally had a chance to try this place out as I don't live in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     What a gem! We tried several items on the menu and all to a dish were superbly thought out, created, plated and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      My favorite by far was the charcuterie . END
BEGIN NOW     all made in house of course. END
BEGIN NOW    Beyond the food, the beer list is extensive and eclectic. END
BEGIN NOW      From what the owners said, constantly rotating as well so I'd encourage frequent visits to sample them all of course. END
BEGIN NOW     They also work directly with breweries rather than through distributors when possible so you know care is taken regarding freshness. END
BEGIN NOW     If I lived closer, I'd own a "mug". END
BEGIN NOW    And the atmosphere! Warm. END
BEGIN NOW     Inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     Family friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Not too loud but still fun and great for groups. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff was very service oriented and the chef/owner is constantly circulating the room and ensuring everyone has a fantastic experience. END
BEGIN NOW    The rapini here is arugalized in-house, and their delicious pea tendrils are wilted to order. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't forget to slather the Yemeni skhug on your quatre epices for that extra kick of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW    Tl;dr: the menu is unrelentingly pretentious, and using inductive reasoning, my party determined all hot dogs are indistinguishable from one another. END
BEGIN NOW    The Hog's . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    is a nice addition to the flourishing Beer Garden trend that is finally catching up to the rest of the USA. END
BEGIN NOW      Yet this one the lacks the actual outdoor experience one would expect of a traditional Beer Garden. END
BEGIN NOW      Nevertheless, there are many things to like about this one. END
BEGIN NOW      Well, of course the beer selections are very satisfactory ranging from imports and domestics on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      The food delights wells especially the Terrines or the Hogs Head Cheese and and the Charcuteries. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing too extraordinary here, but the mains and started complement the beer selection nicely. END
BEGIN NOW      However, avoid the mostly unsparing sides like the Brussels sprouts,  etc. END
BEGIN NOW      More time was put into describing them than preparing them, so theylive on this menu as an afterthought. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is rustic, modern and pleasing ,but it hard to have a conversation here at the larger tables where you nearly have to yell to be hard. END
BEGIN NOW      So if you want something quieter and more chatty, sit by the windows. END
BEGIN NOW    Good food, great service, but this place is so incredibly overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW      $27 for two tiny pieces of fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      $16 for a tiny salad?  Totally ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW      But delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm from San Diego and this is my second visit to the Hog. END
BEGIN NOW      Both times I have had an exceptional time!!  The customer service and beer selection are outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW      The first time I was there Nicole took great care of this out-of-towner and I knew I had to go back. END
BEGIN NOW      Megan in the bar was super awesome and she really knew her beer. END
BEGIN NOW      She paired me up with a great beer that I probably couldn't have picked of myself. END
BEGIN NOW      After that, Marie, Alice and Christy took over and things were consistently great from there. END
BEGIN NOW      The rainbow heirloom was too good to describe in words, so you might want to go down there in person and try it for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW      Every time I'm in Oakland Im stopping by for sure. END
BEGIN NOW      Thanks for the extra Burrata guys!!  Keep up the good work!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Returned for breakfast and was thrilled to see the Benedict back on the menu, this time with pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW     Combined with the schmaltzy potatoes it is just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     And as previously mentioned the iced coffee is delicious, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. END
BEGIN NOW    service was ridiculously slow! I swear there was one. END
BEGIN NOW     MAYBE two people working and the place was packed! I had the corn dog and I like mustard but that stuff was gross, wayy to spicyoverall just not my kind of restaurant i would recommend going just for a beer due to the large selection but the service would keep from going even for that. END
BEGIN NOW    This is my friend's favorite spot so we've eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks and a dozen, or more, times over the last 4 months. END
BEGIN NOW      The host and servers are always helpful, knowledgable and accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW      They make most everything in house, so they can tell you about all of the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       This has been super helpful over the last few weeks because I'm doing the Whole30 diet that requires I not partake in a whole host of ingredients (including no added sugar to anything). END
BEGIN NOW      I've had the same super awesome server the last 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW      She knows what I need and has been incredibly accommodating and helpful in working with the kitchen to help me eat there. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend enjoys trying different beers and every server we've had has happily help him choose the best bear to go with his meal. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm don't drinker beer but they've even helped me find one or two that I like (before I was doing the Whole30). END
BEGIN NOW    If you're looking for friendly service, good solid food and a great beer selection this is a place you should try. END
BEGIN NOW    Beer selection can't be beat, and a knowledgeable staff to guide you thru it. END
BEGIN NOW      Menu is meat heavy as expected, and isn't approachable for everyone. END
BEGIN NOW      However the flavors are incredible and every meal I've had there has been delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Great location for MacArthur BART and I'll be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Large hearty portions, really tasty and comforting. END
BEGIN NOW     Great selection of beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The service however has room for improvement - can never seem to catch the eye of the one server on the floor at 7pm on a Sunday (who whisked away our water bottle in an attempt to refill it, then forgot to return it until we flagged her down to ask about the bottle's whereabouts). END
BEGIN NOW     The squirrely host is no help either - eyes only looking at the silverware he was setting down. END
BEGIN NOW    Have now been to Hog's 3 times, and I have been beyond impressed every time. END
BEGIN NOW     My fancy beer friends are always stoked with the selection of beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     Being more of a wine girl, I really like that selection is as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was DELISH! The summer gems salad was fresh and tasty time. END
BEGIN NOW     The heirloom tomatoes were also super tasty, and the Italian Sausage KILLED IT. END
BEGIN NOW     Go to Hogs, go now. END
BEGIN NOW    Got there for a reservation at 7:30 pm were seated at 8:20pCouldn't hear or think beyond the noise and music. END
BEGIN NOW    Fish dish was dry  and bland. END
BEGIN NOW    Man, this place is awesome!! I came here for the first time a couple days ago and just had to go back last night. END
BEGIN NOW     I found out about the Hog when I decided to Yelp for corn dog places around the bay. END
BEGIN NOW     When this place popped up, I bookmarked it and knew that this place was going to be a winner (have you SEEN the pictures of that sucker?!). END
BEGIN NOW     Located on the corner of Shafter and 40th about a block away from Homeroom, this place is a great location for a quick dinner or to catch up with some friends. END
BEGIN NOW     During the visits, my girlfriend and I got to try their kielbasa ("Who's your Basa?"), corn dog, roasted peppers, and delicious as all-hell potato chips (that are fried in their own pig lard! Yes!!). END
BEGIN NOW     The Hog has a hefty beer collection on tap with relatively lesser-known breweries. END
BEGIN NOW     We met up with a friend and all got to try an IPA with wild rice, imperial IPA, several saisons and a couple of stouts. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't recall the exact number of beers that they have on tap, but it's a very impressive number considering some places in the area only serve up about 10. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're coming here for dinner, make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to just sit at the bar, which really isn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW     The music here is BITCHIN, so prepare to eat good food, drink tasty beer, and groove to some dope music. END
BEGIN NOW    Look, I know that as a vegetarian in a place called "Hog's Apothecary" (or "Hog's" anything else for that matter), I have little right to complain about a lack of food options not made from a pig. END
BEGIN NOW      So I'll only note here that if you are a vegetarian (or keep Kosher or Halal), you are not going to find food here for you. END
BEGIN NOW    We only came here for beer anyway, so I'm not holding it against them. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambiance here is cool-- very Oakland hip. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of beer options, so, there's that. END
BEGIN NOW      Greeter and server and person who finally brought our beers were very nice. END
BEGIN NOW    But I was not that impressed with the beer we had in 2 different flights (so that's 6 different beers--multiple opportunities for good beer), and it took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order once we had sat down. END
BEGIN NOW      We actually gave up we were sitting there so long and finally just went to the bar to order there. END
BEGIN NOW      The place isn't that big and didn't have that many people, but it seems like they didn't have enough servers for the space, and so our nice server lady badly neglected us. END
BEGIN NOW      It's two stars for me on this not because it's a bad place in and of itself but because for Oakland, it's a definite "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW     I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    "  It definitely did not live up to the hype; neither, for me, did it live up to comparisons/experiences/and-mainly-the-beer of Beer Revolution or The Trappist. END
BEGIN NOW    But I'm going to guess that if you like pork with random potentially-not-great-beer that this place is going to be the bee's knees for you. END
BEGIN NOW      Or the pork knees, as it were. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are a beer lover and find yourself in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in here. END
BEGIN NOW     The extensive (mostly local) draft beer list is impressive and is varied enough to keep the whole group happy. END
BEGIN NOW     Our group of 4 started standing by the window while we waited for some seating to open up. END
BEGIN NOW     We then sat at one of the large shared tables in the middle of the restaurant, where we shared a couple bits/starters and two of the house sausages (which are huge). END
BEGIN NOW     Great/lively ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW    Sorry guys! Have always loved the food and amazing draft list but. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill out on the rules. END
BEGIN NOW     The last three times we've been there our experience has been soured by weird overstepping of bar/seating arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW     I've invited multiple guests who've felt snubbed by this. END
BEGIN NOW     I. END
BEGIN NOW    e. END
BEGIN NOW     tonight for my birthday after work our table was approached and I was told we were expected to spend more money on food not just drinks and would have been sat somewhere different. END
BEGIN NOW     This was an odd and somewhat rude admission in light of each person ordering over $30 in drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     I appreciate the attempt to keep the most efficient flow going through the restaurant but the second your patrons feel like pigs led through a feeding trough, you've lost an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't drink beer often but I had a fun time experimenting with the beer menu and having our waitress pick out drinks for me based on my preferences. END
BEGIN NOW      The Harlot (a Belgian pale ale) was my favorite, and given that I overheard a few other parties ordering it, my sense is that it's a pretty popular choice. END
BEGIN NOW    I enjoyed everything we ordered (pork cracklins, meatballs, summer bean ragout and mixed grill) except for the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW      The hot dog tasted overly smokey and burnt to the point where I couldn't really taste the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW      This was highly disappointing because I love corn dogs, but I still recommend coming here for the other dishes, beer selection and attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW    After a rocky first visit (nothing to do with the food), I'm now a HUGE HOG FAN. END
BEGIN NOW     The cod fritters were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     The fried chicken rocked our world. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was charming and I really appreciated the owners reaching out. END
BEGIN NOW     They've totally solved any service problem they had. END
BEGIN NOW    Food:Spicy Pork Cracklin's - Don't get it, it's not very good. END
BEGIN NOW      It doesn't taste like "real" cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW    Belgian-Braised Pork Shoulder - This is a winner. END
BEGIN NOW      For $27, you make the value proposition on this one. END
BEGIN NOW    Choucroute Garnie - It's exactly what it is albeit I was expecting more meat. END
BEGIN NOW      I think there were 4 meat selections and more saurkraut. END
BEGIN NOW      A great plus is that one of the meats is their duck, which is DELISH!  If I compare it to others that I've tried, this lands on the bottom somewhere (That just means I've experienced tons of kick-ass Choucroute Garnie in my life). END
BEGIN NOW    Beer:Yeast and Hops Flights - All good. END
BEGIN NOW      This place has a great selection of beers and if they curate it as they described, extra kudos. END
BEGIN NOW    Lowdown:I'll probably go back for the beer and the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW      The food and area, not so much. END
BEGIN NOW      I would be here often if I lived in the neighborhood, that's how much I liked my experience. END
BEGIN NOW      Some people will say that the food is over-priced, I can see that argument. END
BEGIN NOW    Recommendation:MAKE A RESERVATION. END
BEGIN NOW    Love the ambience annnnd it's in my 'hood. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm going in a hike tomorrow so I wanted something hefty even though I am currently sans meat. END
BEGIN NOW     So I ordered the Gem &amp; Jewels salad along with the Soft Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     Sooooooo good. END
BEGIN NOW     Omg, this salad. END
BEGIN NOW     For reals. END
BEGIN NOW     Not playing. END
BEGIN NOW     The softness of gem lettuce, the sweetness of the persimmon, the tang of the pomegranate cut with the slight acidic tang of the crème fraiche dressing. END
BEGIN NOW     but y'all don't hear me though. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm sure many have waxed poetic about the pretzel so I'll just say, order it. END
BEGIN NOW     Their beer menu is extensive and the staff is very welcoming. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered one of the sausage combos and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausage was made and cooked perfectly, and the fixings, while not terribly appetizing to look at, were perfect along with the bun. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is great and I can always find something new to try. END
BEGIN NOW     Despite being busy, service was quick on everything and the manager was also helping out and very responsive. END
BEGIN NOW    I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Their detail to their house made food,  fine local beers and wine is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The corn dog is the best you'll ever have. END
BEGIN NOW     It gets busy and some might say somewhat pricey, but well worth all of it! I've been here several times since they've opened and am always impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank goodness for fine food in Oakland!PS- they just started doing take-out; I cannot wait to eat a corn dog in bed. END
BEGIN NOW     Yum. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a cool hipster place - love the vibe here. END
BEGIN NOW      If you like beer, it is a must. END
BEGIN NOW      I am not a drinker but friends enjoyed it here. END
BEGIN NOW      The hostess was very friendly to the wait staff. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a place to share food and chat with friends. END
BEGIN NOW      It does get kinda loud in here and you need to raise your voice to talk at times. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is good. END
BEGIN NOW    we shared 2 sampler appetizer plate and an entree. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a good taste of all kinds of pork. END
BEGIN NOW      The portions were good. END
BEGIN NOW    not too small and too overly large. END
BEGIN NOW    good size. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices are decent. END
BEGIN NOW      It is nice to have a gastropub in temescal area. END
BEGIN NOW      With home run down the block and blue bottle opening near by, I am glad this neighborhood is up and coming with great eats. END
BEGIN NOW    This is an awesome place for beer lovers - they just have an amazing selection of local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     They also have a selection of ciders, which I tend to order. END
BEGIN NOW     Usually you can grab a seat at the communal tables, but you can also make reservations if you have a bigger party. END
BEGIN NOW     I've found the food to be a little disappointing, with very few options for vegetarians be warned!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are driving to the neighborhood, do NOT leave anything in your car. END
BEGIN NOW     No bags, no cell phone chargers. END
BEGIN NOW      Your car WILL be broken into, and you will not get your stuff back. END
BEGIN NOW    Okay, I swear, it took me a while to choose between 3 or 4 stars - I've seriously been going back and forth for about 5 minutes now! We ordered the mixed grill - I believe it was a mix of 3 different meats (a piece of sausage, pork belly/thickest bacon slab I ever seeeen) and a half of a small tiny bird (I think Cornish game hen??). END
BEGIN NOW    anyways! 'twas delicious and utterly satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW     Full of flavor and goes so gooood with the beer!OH YEAH. END
BEGIN NOW    the beer. END
BEGIN NOW     that's a whole separate story guys. END
BEGIN NOW     this place has a FAT list of brewery-direct beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     they are hand-selected and have a variety from all over the west coast. END
BEGIN NOW     In addition, they're pretty knowledgeable on the beers they offer, so when in doubt, just ask for a suggestion. END
BEGIN NOW     Now. END
BEGIN NOW    the reason I gave 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    the pricing. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean. END
BEGIN NOW    really, for a small ramekin of basically what we Americans know as "Corn Nuts" you're gonna charge $3 for less than a handful? AND. END
BEGIN NOW    they're way too hard to chew, they might be better off sticking in a sling-shot and letting a kid have some fun. END
BEGIN NOW     $6 for a regular pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The plate we got, Mixed Grill. END
BEGIN NOW    small tiny portions. END
BEGIN NOW    was wrong for 2 of us to share, but THAT small plate was $28 :/  yikes. END
BEGIN NOW    Another reason for not giving 4 stars was the attitude of the staff - mostly the hostess, the guys at the tap, and our specific server. END
BEGIN NOW    so I guess that's the majority. END
BEGIN NOW     they had this attitude that came off as if they were "too cool" or "too hipster" to help out and serve normal people coming from work that just want a good bite and beer. END
BEGIN NOW     definitely felt like they're only welcoming to a certain and specific type of crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    guess you need tats, an old leather jacket and a septum piercing to get the thumbs up for them. END
BEGIN NOW     it's a shame, because I would've gone back for their food and beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW    probably on a pay day since its kinda pricey , HAH!. END
BEGIN NOW    Went by again for an early dinner on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW     No wait right at 5pm, but it seemed to get crowded around 5:45pm. END
BEGIN NOW    This time we had a chance to sample more of the menu and I have to say that I was actually really surprised at how good the food was! I was prepared to support this place based on the fact that it serves good beer and is within walking distance of where I live, but now I can legit say it is worth seeking out. END
BEGIN NOW    We had:- charcuterie sampler of pork rillettes, liver mousse, trotter terrine ($13 for the sampler of three). END
BEGIN NOW     Quality: B+, Adesso is way better. END
BEGIN NOW     Quantity: B, too much of the sides, not quite enough of the main bits, but for $13, it was alright- frisee and arugula salad with grilled peaches and humboldt fog toast ($8 I think?). END
BEGIN NOW     Quality: A+, this was perfectly balanced and well-seasoned and the peaches were ripe and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     Quantity: B, the toast was kinda ridiculously thinly spread with cheese- rabbit &amp; pork belly salad with onion stuff and herb stuff on it, it came with chips and pickles ($14). END
BEGIN NOW     Quality: A+++++ the sausage was incredible. END
BEGIN NOW     I was really blown away by how good it was. END
BEGIN NOW     Served on a nice soft roll that seemed a bit pretzel-like. END
BEGIN NOW     I've eaten at Rosamunde countless times and I have to say, this sausage blows theirs out of the park. END
BEGIN NOW     Seems like maybe they've addressed the "okra slime" issue for the pickled veggie side because I saw no okra and no slime. END
BEGIN NOW     Quantity: B+ the sausage was decently sized but still for the price. END
BEGIN NOW     B+- side of cheddar grits ($6) Quality: A+ hi I love butter cream and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW     yummmmmm Quantity: B. END
BEGIN NOW     come on. END
BEGIN NOW     it's grits. END
BEGIN NOW     you could give us more than 1. END
BEGIN NOW    25 cups for $6. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here three times. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved it the first two, really disliked it the last. END
BEGIN NOW      They've changed the menu: they used to have a great salad ("visions of spring") which still shows up on their online menu but was no longer on offer last Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW      The salad I had (which was basically the only option) called the "green machine" was a salty, gloppy mess. END
BEGIN NOW      And worst of all, they "ran out" of the soft pretzels, which was 90 percent of our reason for being there. END
BEGIN NOW     At 8 p. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW     on a Saturday night - really??? Our less than helpful server offered us nothing as substitute (some of the potato chips that came with the dinner the people next to us had would have been good to satisfy the salty craving, but we didn't know about them). END
BEGIN NOW      And our platter of three different salumi only had two. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess they "ran out" of the third variety. END
BEGIN NOW      Finally, our "medium rare" ribeye was raw: presumably they "ran out" of time to cook it properly. END
BEGIN NOW    We love Hog's Apothecary- relaxed local vibe- great beer and cider selection - I LOVE the Graviva personally - their albeit more limited wine selection works even with their focus on draft and craft beer- food is sophisticated, interesting and the menu is always changing- service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable - they now have added brunch which is awesome :)- to date we have always been able to walk in and get seated - we make reservations about 50% of the time as it can get busy for dinner even early in the dining hour. END
BEGIN NOW    The beer selection is great and fairly priced but the food selection is not. END
BEGIN NOW     Well developed flavor with tragically pretentious ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     It is exactly what you should expect from a hipster joint in piedmont, $23 for a pork chop. END
BEGIN NOW     The meatballs were the best thing on the table. END
BEGIN NOW     Bring your horn rimmed glasses. END
BEGIN NOW    Great beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is very knowledgeable and all I need to tell them is a type of beer I like and they find the perfect match for me. END
BEGIN NOW      Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I have not tried the food yet. END
BEGIN NOW    I tried Hog's Apothecary for the second time. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is very good but the service just horrible. END
BEGIN NOW      I arrive famished on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW      Ordered the Clubber. END
BEGIN NOW      Food arrived about 30 minutes later and the waitress once again quickly disappeared after dropping off the food. END
BEGIN NOW       No apology or acknowledgment on the long time to deliver the food. END
BEGIN NOW      No, "Can I get you anything else?"  No follow up with, "Is everything ok?"   Poof - gone. END
BEGIN NOW      She delivered the wrong sandwich to me, though my partner's was correct. END
BEGIN NOW      Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW      It's such a shame since the food and beer is pretty good here, but not good enough to overshadow the down right poor, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW      Sorry, not going back. END
BEGIN NOW    When going to the restaurant of a friend for the first time, one prepares themselves to be polite, offering words of praise out of the sense of duty that comes with being friends. END
BEGIN NOW      We caution ourselves not to be harsh or critical and generally keep any negatives quiet. END
BEGIN NOW      After all, they are our friends and we'd expect the same. END
BEGIN NOW    Thank goodness I don't have to keep the negatives to myself. END
BEGIN NOW      as I couldn't find any. END
BEGIN NOW      In fact, to say I was impressed would be an understatement. END
BEGIN NOW    Brad and John have taken what once was a dilapidated laundromat with a seedy past and created a neighborhood gathering spot that is open, airy and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      I was at first slightly put off by the long tables and benches, as I generally prefer not to share my table with people I don't know, but I came to realize that it promotes conversation between strangers and contributes to the neighborhood feel. END
BEGIN NOW      While the dining area is not huge, the high ceiling with exposed beams and open air skylight make it feel much larger. END
BEGIN NOW      "Hog's" boasts more taps than I could get through in a week. END
BEGIN NOW      They have beers on tap to appeal to any beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW      They also cycle beers in and out to keep the selections new and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      Now. END
BEGIN NOW     on to the food itself. END
BEGIN NOW      We started out with the warm pretzel for two with cheese sauce and mustard. END
BEGIN NOW     ( One thing you must know before I go further. END
BEGIN NOW      Nearly everything you eat is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW      The mustard, the cheese, the sausage, the kraut. END
BEGIN NOW      the exceptions being the buns and, if memory serves, the pretzel itself. END
BEGIN NOW     )  The pretzel was hot and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      The house made mustard and cheese sauce were the perfect compliment. END
BEGIN NOW      There's just no comparison between jar mustard and mustard made fresh that day. END
BEGIN NOW      For my entree I ordered the schnitzel. END
BEGIN NOW      It's really easy to overcook pork and make it dry. END
BEGIN NOW      Not the case here. END
BEGIN NOW      The breading was light, the pork juicy and while I used my knife at first, I ended up using just my fork as it was so tender. END
BEGIN NOW      The arugula and warm potato salad only served to enhance the succulent pork. END
BEGIN NOW      My dining companions ordered the 'Basa' with kraut and the Devil Bird fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      I was raised by a German mother who made ( and at 70 still makes ) her own kraut. END
BEGIN NOW     As much as I cannot believe I am saying this, ( Sorry, Mom ) the kraut at Hog's is better. END
BEGIN NOW      especially thrown on top of a juicy and savory sausage with just the right pop from the casing. END
BEGIN NOW      ( Sorry, Mom ) The chicken was juicy and full of flavor, but it's the breading that really takes it over the top. END
BEGIN NOW      It's hard to describe, but there's a slight sweetness to it that, to me, was reminiscent of that first bite of a churro or a Krispy Kreme that immediately makes you want another bite. END
BEGIN NOW      It's difficult NOT to want to clean your plate. END
BEGIN NOW    I do have one regret. END
BEGIN NOW      Only one. END
BEGIN NOW      I didn't try dessert. END
BEGIN NOW      We all surveyed the dessert menu, but after a great beer and amazing food there was just no room. END
BEGIN NOW    I know I am a friend and friends tend to be biased so I encourage you to read other reviews. END
BEGIN NOW      Aside from the small contingent of nay-sayers you will find that the overall rating of 4/5 stars is well earned and well deserved. END
BEGIN NOW      It's worth checking out. END
BEGIN NOW    A little spendy for what you get, but everything we had was great and the atmosphere and service was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW    We've visited Hog's a few times now. END
BEGIN NOW      Every single time, we've received amazing food and exceptional service. END
BEGIN NOW      We've left with happy bellies and smiles on our faces. END
BEGIN NOW    The food was great, as were the beers. END
BEGIN NOW      Unfortunately, the service was slow. END
BEGIN NOW      Our server was new, and not super attentive or knowledgeable about the menu. END
BEGIN NOW      Hopefully she'll hit her stride. END
BEGIN NOW    I guess my main issue with this place is that it is not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW      They bill themselves as an "American Beer Hall", which to me means:- A large craft beer selection (check)- A good, informal place to gather with friends (nope-though the potential is there)- Maybe some inexpensive pub style food. END
BEGIN NOW      However, when you walk inside, you are greeted by a hostess and added to the list for a seat at one of their community tables or bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is VERY EXPENSIVE for what it is, and the staff projects a major restaurant vibe, but the atmosphere is that of a bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm really not sure what is going on here but its not at all what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW    For about a year I anticipated their opening and ended up there on the first night they were open to the public. END
BEGIN NOW      I've been back a few times, and it only seems to have become more restaurant-y. END
BEGIN NOW      One positive thing to say, the beer selection is excellent and the price is right for draft beers. END
BEGIN NOW      That said, It's not easy to get in for just a few beers (especially for more than 1-3 people), so I have ended up passing it up when going out with friends even though I live 3 blocks away. END
BEGIN NOW    I really hope that Hog's will make up its mind, are you an up-scale restaurant or are you a beer hall? Right now you are somewhere in-between and it just isn't working for my demographic at all. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're looking for a spot with tons of (mostly) local beers on tap, this is a great spot to visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Death and Taxes is my favorite beer they have. END
BEGIN NOW     They also have a small selection of wines if beer isn't your thing. END
BEGIN NOW     The Grilled Greens starter I had there was meh. END
BEGIN NOW     It was way too salty for me. END
BEGIN NOW     I wouldn't recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW     However, I heard the corn dog is amazing, i will have to try it next time I'm there. END
BEGIN NOW     The Devilbird (fried chicken on top of some spicy garbanzo beans with chili oil) OMG. END
BEGIN NOW     So delicious and perfectly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW     So buttermilky and crispy! I love the fried chicken there. END
BEGIN NOW     It never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is great there, I've never had any issues with the staff whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW     They're always nice and prompt! Also: be prepared to get a little cozy with other patrons, the seating is picnic table style. END
BEGIN NOW    Great beer selection, corn dog and hot dog were ok but made in house. END
BEGIN NOW     pate, rillette were on point. END
BEGIN NOW     would def come back for some beer and pate. END
BEGIN NOW    Kinda shocking to read reviews about how snobby the wait staff was, I found the service to be very friendly and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW     As for the food and beer - YUM. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was so flavorful, with fresh herbs and the sauce on the pork chops was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved it so much, we asked the waitress if we could have some bread so we could sop up every ounce, because yes, we are hogs. END
BEGIN NOW     The kitchen specially prepared some toast for us so we could lick the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection was good, the menu described the brews well and I was pleased with my selection. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior is pretty cool, but can get loud. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking forward to returning. END
BEGIN NOW    If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! There food and beer is fantastic! They have an industrial feel to them and sure its a hipster joint but that doesn't detract from the delicious food and beer!Recommendations: 1. END
BEGIN NOW     Butchers coffer. END
BEGIN NOW     Get all three, every time. END
BEGIN NOW     Its worth it2. END
BEGIN NOW     Lil Salty3. END
BEGIN NOW     Any of their sausagesBeer: 1. END
BEGIN NOW     The Butcher 2. END
BEGIN NOW     Tunnel VisionGreat Job guys. END
BEGIN NOW    Only tried the beers here so I can't comment on food. END
BEGIN NOW     There was a great variety of drinks and the bartender was so nice to let me try several until I found a beer I was satisfied with. END
BEGIN NOW     Sucks that its so hard to find a seat here, it seems like they could better maximize their space. END
BEGIN NOW     Also the lighting in here was so dark. END
BEGIN NOW     But overall, another trendy restaurant to hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm a little biased since it's right up my street, but Hog's is a pretty special place. END
BEGIN NOW     The rotating taps, solid food, and ambiance are great. END
BEGIN NOW     Tried their brunch for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. END
BEGIN NOW     Had the pork belly/beef burger and apothecary benedict at our table and both were very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     They also were open to showing the football game our group wanted to watch. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, a solid four stars, and my go-to neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Much, much better reason to come to 40th Street than Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW    Hot damn. END
BEGIN NOW      We came here for their soft opening, and we've been coming here regularly ever since. END
BEGIN NOW      The food: fantastic, inventive, and there's always something new. END
BEGIN NOW      It tends to be heavy fare (even the vegetable sides and salads, which will frequently have an egg or lardons), but it's always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      We've tried things from every section of their menu and have never been disappointed (well, I didn't like their collards, but I'm from Kentucky. END
BEGIN NOW      The kale, on the other hand, is always amazing). END
BEGIN NOW    The beer: excellent selection of mostly local breweries. END
BEGIN NOW      They generally have good prices ($5-$6, though watch out for the expensive Rare Barrel offerings), as well as a nice balance of beer styles, ranging from pilsners to Belgian Quadrupels, and thankfully not too many IPAs. END
BEGIN NOW    The service: we've had one or two servers who weren't on the ball, but the regular staff is fabulous, friendly, and knowledgeable about their beers. END
BEGIN NOW      I love that the owners are typically around, pitching in. END
BEGIN NOW      They're really friendly if you get the chance to talk to them. END
BEGIN NOW    The cons?  It can get loud at times, but that shouldn't be an issue if you go earlier in the evening. END
BEGIN NOW      But that's a pretty minor drawback when everything else is so good. END
BEGIN NOW    Just. END
BEGIN NOW     meh. END
BEGIN NOW     Pros: Big beer selectionInteresting menuCool vibeDecent foodCons:HORRIBLE service (waited 2 hours)Overpriced for what you getLoudI wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW     It definitely wasn't worth the $90+ dollars my husband I spent on a few drinks, an appetizer, and one entree. END
BEGIN NOW    I LOVE the food and the beer list at Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW     The service has always been good to above average in terms of speed, attentiveness and product knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW     The house made sausages are great, the schnitzel great, the fried chicken so plump and juicy. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer list has many styles from many great big and small California craft breweries. END
BEGIN NOW     I would say there beer list rivals any beer hall in Oakland including the Good Hop, Beer Rev and Cato's. END
BEGIN NOW     HOWEVER, they were spendy, $14 for a bratwurst, when I first started going there 1 year ago and now they are $17. END
BEGIN NOW     They are served with  some homemade chips and a small pile of pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW     Hog's like everything else in "up and coming" Oakland is darned expensive for modest portions. END
BEGIN NOW     Beers have gone up $2/pint as well. END
BEGIN NOW      I get they have high rent, need to pay employees a living wage and nothing is getting cheaper but my sense is these trendy dining houses are going for it because their clientele will pay whatever they try to charge at a cool place. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll miss you, Hogs, but $17 bucks for a fancy hot dog and $7. END
BEGIN NOW    50 for a pint of IPA isn't a good value. END
BEGIN NOW     4 stars for beer and food, 4 stars for service and atmosphere, 2 stars for value. END
BEGIN NOW     Average 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Hip neighborhood joint, with the usual trendy, expensive spin. END
BEGIN NOW     I did enjoy the food, (yum!), and the beer, (good beer menu selection). END
BEGIN NOW     I'd give the place 4 stars, but the value is lacking. END
BEGIN NOW     $23. END
BEGIN NOW    47 for a beer ($5. END
BEGIN NOW    50), a side of bacon ($6?!) and a Brussel Sprout salad with bacon bits &amp; one egg ($10?!). END
BEGIN NOW     It's too expensive to make it a regular stop. END
BEGIN NOW    My friends and I had a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd go back. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome if you like beer, which we do. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, beer + meat = amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Get the meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice atmosphere, a beer hall, kinda romantical, actually. END
BEGIN NOW     Bummer? The service. END
BEGIN NOW     Awkward, lackluster. END
BEGIN NOW      Although the server didn't really eat meat, they also didn't seem interested in the food or beer. END
BEGIN NOW     No recommendations or knowledge about either. END
BEGIN NOW     Which is fine - I believe I was far more excited, and we can both ride that wave. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, the hostess was strange. END
BEGIN NOW     If I worked there I'd own it  - its easy to make service industry customers who came to get drunk and spend money happy. END
BEGIN NOW      At least at my job it is. END
BEGIN NOW     This place has so much potential - can you imagine if the service was at the very least  - engaging? It has a casual vibe, but once you see the prices you'll be looking for some engagement, I promise you. END
BEGIN NOW     Some other random cute staff would come by and be nice and fill water and I was grateful. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer float is small, but very good. END
BEGIN NOW    super excited about this addition to the 40th/broadway area. END
BEGIN NOW     the service, the foods, the beer selection(!), the ambiance, the space, everything gets an A+!we got sat along the bar that is built around the perimeter of the pub, facing out onto 40th, and we had no complaints. END
BEGIN NOW     our server was so on top of it, it actually took me by surprise. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm just not used to someone checking in every 10 minutes, but this is what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW     we were not of want of anything. END
BEGIN NOW     from water to new beers, she was there to make sure we had what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW     and the place was packed. END
BEGIN NOW     other highlights - the house made pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW     GET ONE. END
BEGIN NOW     the music was perfect, not too loud, but just loud enough that I picked up on one of my fave bands of all time - pavement, then some sonic youth, plus some other 90's-ish indie rock that I was definitely digging. END
BEGIN NOW     parking as others have mentioned is a breeze. END
BEGIN NOW     and it's also just a block or two down from the local record shop (1,2,3,4 go records), the cool mens shop - Pine &amp; Elder, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     so you can get your shop on beforehand if you so choose. END
BEGIN NOW     finally, I just need to add that I was more than just a little excited about their beer offerings. END
BEGIN NOW     and I'm not even a huge beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW     the two that I tried - a dark chocolatey number  (coffee &amp; cigarettes by CellarMaker) and a local herbal beer that came recommended (a style I never even knew existed but one that I'm kinda dying to sample again!) completely blew me away. END
BEGIN NOW     this is the stuff I expect from a beer institution like Trappist but not from the new neighborhood pub. END
BEGIN NOW     yet, hog's is the spot I have a hankering to return to. END
BEGIN NOW     asap. END
BEGIN NOW     stop by before there's a line out the door. END
BEGIN NOW     it's only a matter of time!. END
BEGIN NOW    It was really tasty! I was very impressed with the beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW     If I wasn't the one that drove I swear I would have tried at least 5 on the list. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend and I split two of the sausage sandwiches and both were very good. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is very hipster. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a shuffleboard in the back. END
BEGIN NOW     The seating is bench style where you'll be seated at a long table, possibly next to really obnoxious people that you have to just try to ignore and talk over and try not to look at and throw death stares over. END
BEGIN NOW     (If I had that 5th beer I'm sure I would have become best friends with them. END
BEGIN NOW    ). END
BEGIN NOW    We feel happy to report we live only ten minutes away and can return repeatedly with no effort. END
BEGIN NOW     A creative menu with fabulous execution, we have enjoyed everything we have ordered. END
BEGIN NOW      The salads and starters are great. END
BEGIN NOW     We loved their version of a Caesar salad. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausages are fabulous with homemade chips and slaw, yummy. END
BEGIN NOW     Their skirt steak and pork chops are incredible. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's not forget a large on tap beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW       Marvelous find. END
BEGIN NOW    First met Tim as he was sourcing his ingredients from local farmers markets, a year ago. END
BEGIN NOW      I still see him there today. END
BEGIN NOW         Tonight was my first night to visit and eat, and I was not disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried two starters, a salad and two of the sausage sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW      I could go on and on to say how the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sausages burst with complex but not overwhelming flavors, and lard fried chips were crisp and light. END
BEGIN NOW       But I won't, and just say that they have a large array of detailed local beers, and they craft their food with thought, care and precision from farm to fork. END
BEGIN NOW        Yum!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are looking for a good heavy meal and unique beer in Oakland, the Hog's Apothecary is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a small neighborhood restaurant, that has an industrial tap house feel. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff was friendly and service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      I would not say the service was particularly fast or slow, but servers were attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      It seemed to feature mostly small local breweries (many I had never even heard of). END
BEGIN NOW      The variety of the beer selection was great and everything we tried was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW      I love trying new beer, especially from small California breweries, and I loved that this restaurant offered a wide variety of choices. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant does take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW     They seem to be busy while we were there so if you can get a reservation I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW      However (according to the website, only some of the restaurant can be reserved, so they also take plenty of walk-ins). END
BEGIN NOW      There are two TVs above the bar area, so If you are hoping to catch a game on TV they have you covered. END
BEGIN NOW     Our food was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     All of the small bites were great. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel was my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW     That alone could have been my meal. END
BEGIN NOW      The spicy mustard was GREAT, but spicy!! If you love horseradish you will LOVE this mustard (and its perfect with the buttery flavor of the pretzel). END
BEGIN NOW      I had the Titanic salad. END
BEGIN NOW      It was great and plenty of food for a main meal. END
BEGIN NOW      My husband had half dozen oysters and ribs and he had nothing but positives to say about that. END
BEGIN NOW      My only criticism about the experience was that the restaurant was very warm inside. END
BEGIN NOW      The windows were open but it didn't seem to provide much airflow. END
BEGIN NOW     Its a small space, so with the kitchen cooking and a full restaurant it can become uncomfortably warm. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, great beer, yummy food and nice people. END
BEGIN NOW      We will definitely go back. END
BEGIN NOW    Pros:  fast and friendly service           Food is hearty and good           Good beer selectionCons: food is very heavy . END
BEGIN NOW    but it's good. END
BEGIN NOW    First time dining here today. END
BEGIN NOW      Had reservations for Mother's Day. END
BEGIN NOW      We were seated quickly, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our waiter showed up. END
BEGIN NOW      I had been looking around, with pleading eyes, hoping maybe someone could take the time to get a mimosa started for a mom. END
BEGIN NOW      But no. END
BEGIN NOW      No water, nothing. END
BEGIN NOW      The place was still half empty. END
BEGIN NOW    The food was really good though. END
BEGIN NOW    My son ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits were kind of drowned in the gravy, so my son wasn't eating them. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked if he could have a dry biscuit and they said sure no problem. END
BEGIN NOW      Of course surprise when the bill came- they just had to charge us the $5 for the dry biscuit- which was about 15 cents of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      If they had warned us at the time they they weren't simply trying to help a customer be satisfied with their meal, and would be charging us, maybe I would not have been so annoyed. END
BEGIN NOW      But between the 20 minute wait for service and the nickel and diming, it left me not looking forward to a return. END
BEGIN NOW    If you care nothing about service, this place will be just fine. END
BEGIN NOW    Visited today 5. END
BEGIN NOW    4. END
BEGIN NOW    16 I was working from home today and my friend stopped by to visit me. END
BEGIN NOW     We got really hungry and decided to be adventurous and try a new place. END
BEGIN NOW     The hog's apothecary has been on my list for quite some time now. END
BEGIN NOW     I bookmarked it for their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     It was pretty empty for a Wednesday at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess it's to be expected. END
BEGIN NOW     Sadly, they didn't have the corn dog offered today at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I decided to get the trail park boy. END
BEGIN NOW     Their bread is good! The mortadella was new to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I liked it, a bit too salty. END
BEGIN NOW     Actually salt was a big problem with our meal here. END
BEGIN NOW     We share the supernova appetizer/starter. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a mixed green beet salad with herb crème fraîche. END
BEGIN NOW     It was so incredibly SALTY. END
BEGIN NOW     We kind of forced ourselves to eat it when we honestly should've just sent it back or just stopped eating it. END
BEGIN NOW     The only thing good about the salad was the toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW     My side salad that came with my sandwich was also wayyyy to salty. END
BEGIN NOW     I didn't even try to eat it. END
BEGIN NOW     We drank two jugs of water while we were there. END
BEGIN NOW     This place was pretty disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW     /: I wouldn't come back here unless it was to try their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent experience at this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Communal seating, sports TVs, great service, and gourmet artisan food. END
BEGIN NOW     Their products are quality, and so even though they're pricey, they are decently portioned. END
BEGIN NOW     They change their menu every day, so that's exciting. END
BEGIN NOW    Fun place in Oakland! I came here for dinner with friends after a day of drinking our way through Napa. END
BEGIN NOW    Outside, you'll be impressed with the big clean windows and inside, you'll find community tables and a menu with lots of beers. END
BEGIN NOW    and a surprising amount of hotdogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Most of my group went the hotdog route but I opted for the "Pride of Castroville" which was delicious with juicy artichokes. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun service, chill atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    Lively, quality gastropub that's helping to put the area around 40th Street and Broadway on the map as a new dining corridor in Oakland, with a feel and identity that's distinct from gentrified Piedmont Avenue not far away. END
BEGIN NOW    The first things you notice are the tremendous craft beer selection and the meat/pork-heavy menu. END
BEGIN NOW     As for the beer, the selection is quite extensive and although it features mostly craft brews, it looks like it's been curated to be very comprehensive across all major styles. END
BEGIN NOW     Moreover, if you have any questions about any single beer item, you could ask for a little taste, or you could ask for advice on what pairs well with certain dishes on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    And as for the menu, it is quite meat-heavy (although I assume some items may be vegetarian-friendly or can be made so). END
BEGIN NOW     While items like sausages might sound steep at around $13, the portion size is tremendous, and the case of the "Got Seoul" sausage that they offered recently, it comes topped uniquely with Asian ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     There are even meatier, more substantial entrees available too, all with whimsical names to them. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything is so meaty and delicious, you'll be "mmm"-ing with approval throughout the meal. END
BEGIN NOW    The overall atmosphere is quite friendly and festive, with lots of communal seating, and the place can be packed most of the time. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is also knowledgeable and friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW     Chalk up another win for the 40th Street area and for the Oakland dining scene. END
BEGIN NOW    Your typical hipster joint. END
BEGIN NOW     Bearded men, beer, beer snacks made in-house, pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW    Crater Lake Root Beer was delish. END
BEGIN NOW     Served in a metal cup with perfectly square ice cubes that don't get in the way, it has a refreshing but light sassafras taste. END
BEGIN NOW     It's $5 for about 10 oz. END
BEGIN NOW    Pretzel was pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW     The mustard was more like wasabi pretending to be mustard. END
BEGIN NOW     The malted mayo was brown mayo. END
BEGIN NOW    The space is pretty comfortable but service was okay. END
BEGIN NOW     No one came to our table for quite a while until we asked. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Hangar steak and eggs were perfectly rare and runny (respectively) and biscuits with friend chicken add-on was gooey and juicy (respectively)Draught iced coffee was strong without being overly bitter and creamy smooth cream. END
BEGIN NOW    Service was quick and attentive and just as hipster as one would expect. END
BEGIN NOW    A happy find in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Interesting selection of beers and tasty food. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the New York Reuben sandwich and was very satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW      The pastrami is almost shredded, which worked fine, and the flavor was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      Husband had the meatball sandwich and enjoyed it tremendously. END
BEGIN NOW      Freshly made potato chips were perfectly cooked. END
BEGIN NOW      We will happily go back anytime. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a very difficult place to decide whether it's a 3 or a 5 star. END
BEGIN NOW     I opted for 4 stars, and here's why. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance is beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW     The lighting is low and glowing, and extremely inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall setup of this restaurant is well thought out. END
BEGIN NOW     And they have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap; different local breweries with brief descriptions. END
BEGIN NOW     Their food is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a bit pricey for my wallet, but that's with the understanding the local (sustainable) farmers provide produce and meat. END
BEGIN NOW     And it's good. END
BEGIN NOW     Just beyond my budget for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW     I have a pretty decent job and all, but this is Oakland after all, and $25 entrees, no matter how high the quality of food, is just not within my budget of reasonable spending for a single entree, not including drinks, not including  my partner  or her  choice of food and beverage. END
BEGIN NOW     I will probably just stick to going there for some booze. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are great, the servers are somewhere between mediocre and great, and overall this business seems to have a lot of pride and it presents itself well. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely worth stopping by for a beer and scoping things out. END
BEGIN NOW     It's very inviting. END
BEGIN NOW    ** honorable mention, this is with respect to Jack R review. END
BEGIN NOW     Just wanted to make the argument that Jack's review is wildly inappropriate. END
BEGIN NOW     Not only is it borderline chauvinistic with his constant mention of how attractive the waitress was, but it's inappropriate with respect to how his failure to order left the waitress to awkwardly make suggestions and order food for him, that he later, somehow, "realized" he didn't know what she had ordered, and therefore he did not like it. END
BEGIN NOW     Went on to joke about how his friend nearly pushed the waitress into his lap, then complained about the food again. END
BEGIN NOW     You're a douche, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW     I think you should take your review down. END
BEGIN NOW     **. END
BEGIN NOW    My girlfriend and I went on a double date with two of our friends, and we had dinner at The Hog's Apothecary. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     This restaurant has communal tables which is something that I absolutely disdain. END
BEGIN NOW     As someone who has a busy schedule and is in a long distance relationship, my time with my girlfriend, my friends, and my family is precious to me. END
BEGIN NOW     When I finally get the time to spend with my self-selected company, I hate having to shout over strangers to avoid being drowned out by their own conversations. END
BEGIN NOW     That being said, the communal tables at Hog's were not nearly as cramped as the ones at Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW     You still have to do a lot of yelling though. END
BEGIN NOW     The hard wooden benches were pretty uncomfortable too. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything else about the restaurant was really great though. END
BEGIN NOW     They offer a preponderance of great local and semi-local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the Buddha's Hand IPA from Berryessa Brewing in Winters, CA, and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     It was not overly bitter and had a pleasant citrus taste from the Buddha's hand. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone else enjoyed their beers as well. END
BEGIN NOW    My girlfriend and I started our meal with a soft pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel had a rich, brown skin and was light and airy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed the spicy mustard dipping sauce that came with the pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The heat from the mustard hits you right in the sinuses (in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW    For our meal, we shared the corn dog and the Jamaican Me Crazy sausage. END
BEGIN NOW    Corn dog: Easily one of the best (non-State Fair) corn dogs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     However, I feel like corn dogs are kind of like donuts. END
BEGIN NOW     Awful ones are still pretty good, and even the best version with the best possible ingredients is only a few times better than the average ones. END
BEGIN NOW     Jamaican Me Crazy: The sausage was tasty, although the jerk seasoning could have been a little more bold. END
BEGIN NOW     I only tasted faint traces of allspice. END
BEGIN NOW     The bun pillow-soft and provided a textural contrast to the pop I would get when biting into the casing of the sausage. END
BEGIN NOW     The potato chips were tasty too. END
BEGIN NOW     While both items were really good, they do seem a little overpriced for what they are. END
BEGIN NOW    Our service was good, although there was some redundancy between the servers. END
BEGIN NOW     Several different people came around to take our orders and this led to some confusion when my girlfriend ordered a second beer and two of the servers mistakenly thought that the other one would get the beer. END
BEGIN NOW     They got it right eventually though. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall, I like The Hog's Apothecary and would come back another time for beer and a corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Every time I pass by Hog's Apothecary, it's filled to the brim with customers. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu is filled with (overpriced) sausage options. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess it's their specialty, but no way in hell I am buying into gourmet hotdogs prices anymore. END
BEGIN NOW     I already think Rosamunde and Wurstkuche in LA are overhyped and overpriced so $12+ for a dog? I really don't think so. END
BEGIN NOW    Instead, I tried out the brunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW     At first look, everything is pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW     The servers are nice, the interior is open with long communal tables, and they have an extensive "hipster" beer list. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm on a Belgian kick lately for I get the two Belgian beers and they are both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     After we ordered the food, about 45 minutes have passed and we are already close to finishing our second beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The service is painfully slow. END
BEGIN NOW     In fact, I saw some other tables that came in after us getting their food first. END
BEGIN NOW     What's up with that?They see us get a bit antsy and assure us our food is coming out. END
BEGIN NOW     I receive my French Monsieur which is good, with a nice kick of Horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW     I also try the Apothecary Benedict and must admit, the house made ham is quite good. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything tastes pretty good but they are all pretty much heart attacks on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is definitely better than average but not enough to make me keep wanting to come back. END
BEGIN NOW     The problem with this place, and a bunch of other new hipster joints in Oakland, is that everything is "artisanal" but that doesn't mean it necessarily makes everything taste better nor does it justify the stiff prices. END
BEGIN NOW     There are too many places in Oakland which offers a good beer list and hipster food, but it's kind of getting out of hand. END
BEGIN NOW     What's next, $20 sausage made with baby dragon butt and foie gras? I digress but I didn't feel Hog's was a step above any other already existing places. END
BEGIN NOW     That's why I'll give it an A-OK. END
BEGIN NOW    We brought some of our fam here, because I mean it has hog in the name--- why wouldn't we? They only serve beer and wine, so don't expect a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu is a great mix of stuff to share and entrees. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered a mix of bar snacks, appetizers and one entree to share. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything was super tasty! The staff was super awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The one thing that I didn't like was the bench seating (I need a seat back when filling my belly) and there was no where to hang my jacket &amp; purse. END
BEGIN NOW      We will definitely go back here to try more of the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    My wife &amp; I decided to start out 2016 with brunch here today. END
BEGIN NOW      Brunch was quite busy today, so it was good that we made a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW      She started with a mimosa, while I had a pint of hefeweizen (a tough choice, as they have over 25 beers on draft). END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the chicken and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW      You can get either maple syrup or gravy with this order, but I recommend the syrup. END
BEGIN NOW      The onion waffle and fried chicken are very savory, so the sweetness of the syrup brings a nice balance. END
BEGIN NOW      They use boneless chicken thighs, so you can forgo utensils and just dig in with your bare hands!My wife ordered a benedict, which comes with the house pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW      The egg was cooked perfectly, but the dish (along with the house potatoes) were a little on the salty side. END
BEGIN NOW    We ordered a side of bacon to share, which could have been cooked a little longer. END
BEGIN NOW    The service was excellent:  attentive, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW      The place got pretty loud as it got crowded, but it was very festive for the holiday. END
BEGIN NOW    I was out Free Wheeling and I had a fresh Charge on my Ankle Bracelet . END
BEGIN NOW     Today was a good day to eliminate another Book Mark . END
BEGIN NOW    So I rolled to The Hogs Apothecary and Oaktown. END
BEGIN NOW    I rolled up and Parked right across the street . END
BEGIN NOW     No Parking Lot just Street Parking . END
BEGIN NOW    They also have Bike Parking right up front. END
BEGIN NOW     The Cool Thing is the Front Door Handles are Shaped like Giant Meat Cleavers. END
BEGIN NOW    I was Greeted upon Entering and  Grabbed  a Seat at the Bar. END
BEGIN NOW     The Furnishings are Very Sturdy and some of it is from Repurposed Materials very cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Their Bar Menu and Food Menu Change Daily . END
BEGIN NOW     They also Butcher a Whole Pig every Tuesday and they use every part in Meal preparation . END
BEGIN NOW    They have 2 LCD TVs for Sporting Events . END
BEGIN NOW    They also have a Nice Big Open Air Skylight . END
BEGIN NOW    Their Bartenders are a Wealth of Info . END
BEGIN NOW    They have several Micro Brews on Tap. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered a Whippersnapper -Southern English Style Brown Mild Ale . END
BEGIN NOW     I Liked It. END
BEGIN NOW    I then ordered a Chocolypto - Imperial Stout with Oatmeal and Cacao . END
BEGIN NOW     I really like this one it was Rich and Robust . END
BEGIN NOW    My Final Beer was Framboos / Batch 28 -Belgian Style Ale with Raspberries . END
BEGIN NOW     This is a Must Order very Flavorful and Fruity . END
BEGIN NOW    For Dinner I Ordered The Belgian Braise - House Butchered Pork Shoulder braised in Societe ale , heirloom grits , charred radish rapini  braising  jus ,hard herb- bread crumb salsa . END
BEGIN NOW    This was very good the Pork was so Tender it melted in my Mouth . END
BEGIN NOW     Yummy I also ordered a Corn Dog and it Came with House rendered Lard Fried Kennebec Potato Chips and Mixed Pickles . END
BEGIN NOW     This was also good . END
BEGIN NOW    My Servers were Very Nice and Prompt . END
BEGIN NOW     I Paid By Discover Card and Rolled out. END
BEGIN NOW    The fried chicken was piled high and looked scrumptious, but it was raw. END
BEGIN NOW      Not under done, not pink. END
BEGIN NOW      Gelatinously raw. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked that it be removed from the bill which they did, but I was surprised our server didn't seem more alarmed by the fact that raw chicken made it onto the plate. END
BEGIN NOW     This is fine if you like communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW    It took me awhile, but I finally got to try Hog's and for brunch, nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW    I came on a Saturday and there was a good crowd and we got seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW     I had one of their many beers on tap, though I don't recall which one. END
BEGIN NOW     I went with the Belgian Waffles with Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     The waffles were savory and the fried chicken was a must. END
BEGIN NOW     Otherwise, what's the point? The dish was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW     Though the person I was with got the something else, it was very small for the price, even though my dish was a bit pricey as well. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't remember what he got, as it is not on the menu online. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is good and the service is good as well. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a place I would come to every once in a long awhile, but certainly worth a try. END
BEGIN NOW    I live down the street so I always end up here when I can't make a decision on what to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer selection and excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW     Menu is always changing, which is nice because I can always order something new. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartender told us they base their menu off of what is available that day. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, service has always been super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    I should have ordered the Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    As good as that dish looked though (and as much as I wanted to try it), I knew I had to order something pork related. END
BEGIN NOW      After all, between Hog's Apothecary's name and their giant pig statue that hovered behind me, it'd practically be sacrilegious not to!  And I am not one to mess with the pork/bacon/pork belly powers that may be (all hail, Bacon!). END
BEGIN NOW    With a menu that is constantly changing, Hog's Apothecary has a lot to offer, even if the day's menu isn't super extensive - roughly a dozen starters and sides, a handful of sausages, and a few different entrées. END
BEGIN NOW      What's more, there's beer and lots of it. END
BEGIN NOW      With over 25 varieties on tap (mostly craft brews), you could even forgo eating and just sample beers all night long. END
BEGIN NOW    -- SPICY PORK CRACKLIN'S. END
BEGIN NOW    $3(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…)These cracklin's are crackin'!  Not only are they borderline addictive, but they really do pack some heat, as every piece is coated with a spicy, mouth-watering seasoning (don't forget the lime!). END
BEGIN NOW      What's more, the portion is quite generous!  A great starter for groups to share. END
BEGIN NOW    -- BOURBON-CHICKEN LIVER PATE. END
BEGIN NOW    $6(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…)Although larger slices of bread would have been nice to spread out all that pate, I'm not definitely not complaining about those giant gobs either!  While every bite was rich and decadent, the taste was also nicely accentuated by the sea salt and the berries. END
BEGIN NOW      If this isn't the best one I've had, it wouldn't be far behind. END
BEGIN NOW    -- SUPERFECTA SAUSAGE SANDWICH - Pork, Rabbit, Chicken, Tim's Brown Ale, Basque Chili &amp; Mild Herbs, Fennel-Onion Braise, Dijon Mustard. END
BEGIN NOW    $14(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…)The only blemish, but it was a big one. END
BEGIN NOW      I was hopeful for trio of meats in the sausage, but it wasn't even juicy, let alone flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      Ironically, the braise had the opposite effect, overpowering whatever flavor the meat had with fennel. END
BEGIN NOW      Sadly, besides the chips, the only other thing I enjoyed were the pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW    As underwhelming as my order was, it really was the only "bad" thing about my experience. END
BEGIN NOW      Great food otherwise, an awesome selection of beers, fantastic staff (they let our large party split our bill into smaller tabs), and (relatively) easy parking. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus, with several long tables, Hog's Apothecary is grew for groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW    Also, it's worth noting that the rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit (we all ordered different things), so it wouldn't surprise me if what I had just wasn't one of their better dishes. END
BEGIN NOW      Especially since the starters were really good. END
BEGIN NOW      Rounding up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I wonder what might have been if I had only ordered the fried chicken!. END
BEGIN NOW    4. END
BEGIN NOW    5 StarsProsA great variety of draft beers + a flight option Pretzel was easily shareable and well done Fun atmosphereChill staff ConsUmmmm can be pricey depending on your beer choice Overall ThoughtsWhile I enjoyed my experience with the beer I want to come back for the food to see if it can be bumped up that last half star!. END
BEGIN NOW    Order the meatballs (appetizer) and fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     They have tons of beer on tap!  I was in the mood for cider and they had 2 to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW    I can wait to come back here. END
BEGIN NOW      Such a gem!. END
BEGIN NOW    Will not be returning. END
BEGIN NOW     I give the ambiance, environment, resources (food and drink) a mediocre mark, nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW     It was the service I wasn't happy with. END
BEGIN NOW     I have not ever been talked to like that here in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     I brought my service dog and two friends and was felt less than welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW     Although we did get to sit down for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW     Our waiter, the bartender, Josh H, near beginning of dinner, was kind of an asshole to my friends and I. END
BEGIN NOW     He immediately had a tone upon first approach like he wasn't going to like us, asking about my small dog. END
BEGIN NOW     I told him we had already talked to the manager and were welcomed to sit down. END
BEGIN NOW     I felt like he would have told us to leave. END
BEGIN NOW    Josh came over to my friends and I to get our drink order. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend had a question which left much to be interpreted. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead of helping my friend out he insulted her by remarking "how all over the place" her question was. END
BEGIN NOW     I was floored. END
BEGIN NOW     I later asked for a glass of water. END
BEGIN NOW     Of course I had my dog in my lap away from others, I gave him a chance to drink out of the glass. END
BEGIN NOW     Josh comes out of nowhere and immediately rips the glass out of my hand and scolds me. END
BEGIN NOW     Stroke two. END
BEGIN NOW     We were all ready to leave by this point. END
BEGIN NOW     He returned with a paper cup of water for my dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Sweet? Hardly. END
BEGIN NOW     He also assumed we wanted separate checks when we did not. END
BEGIN NOW     Perhaps he was having a bad day but a first impression is a first impression bud. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible service. END
BEGIN NOW     Money is tight for most and I wouldn't waste a second try on somewhere that was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW     In order to harvest a community you should probably be more friendly to your locals and their pooches. END
BEGIN NOW     Word spreads fast. END
BEGIN NOW    It's currently SF Beer Week. END
BEGIN NOW      Like, I'm sad that I even had to work at all this week, but I need the money to taste the beer, so here we are. END
BEGIN NOW      Last night, the hubs and I met some good friends at the Hog's Apothecary as they were hosting brews from FiftyFifty Brewing. END
BEGIN NOW      I stalked the menu online, and many of their offerings are meat and pork and sausage and YES. END
BEGIN NOW      Our server was very friendly and very attentive. END
BEGIN NOW       A+Location - near (in?) Temescal in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      I hear this is a notorious hipsterville area. END
BEGIN NOW      No matter, this place is kinda by itself on a corner. END
BEGIN NOW      Walking in, there are picnic tables, so you sit community style with others. END
BEGIN NOW      There was a bar to my right, communal seating in the middle, and bar seating along the left edge. END
BEGIN NOW      I enjoyed the decor, but man, it's loud AF in there. END
BEGIN NOW      We were there in the evening, after 7pm and it wasn't super crowded, but it sounded like it. END
BEGIN NOW     We were fortunate enough to be able to move to a corner booth so we could hear our own conversation. END
BEGIN NOW     Beer - I sampled two beers and shite, I can't remember the name of the FiftyFifty beer. END
BEGIN NOW      It started with an M, if I remember correctly, and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Winner winner!  The second beer was the German Table Beer, a dark German session with wheat. END
BEGIN NOW      Also delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I wish it hadn't been a Wednesday night because I would've picked at LEAST three more to try. END
BEGIN NOW      The selection is superb. END
BEGIN NOW      Most of my stars are dedicated to this. END
BEGIN NOW    Food - We ordered the Snack Bar and split among us four. END
BEGIN NOW      I think it's a good bang for your buck. END
BEGIN NOW      You get a HUGE fresh soft pretzel, house made corn nuts, olives, and pork cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything on that platter was delicious, though I feel as though the cracklins were a little stale. END
BEGIN NOW      Could've just been me. END
BEGIN NOW      Hubs and I split the Steph Currywurst. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a good portion for one person. END
BEGIN NOW      That was my bad. END
BEGIN NOW      Not too overwhelming with the curry flavor, with nice pickled onions and chips on the side. END
BEGIN NOW      I left needing something else though. END
BEGIN NOW    I took away a star due to price. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, the selection is great. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is well thought-out and complementary to the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      It was pricey for me though (see 1st paragraph). END
BEGIN NOW      A sausage dog, although delicious was $14. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, still a good place. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd come here again on a semi-full stomach to sample more beer. END
BEGIN NOW    Great brunch place! Friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW     Sat at the bar and was served by a cool guy from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW     A wide variety of beer on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     The Royale with Cheese was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The oysters were sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     I will definitely return to try the pumpkin pie donut holes!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you want a sausage and beer, this is definitely the place to be! Also, if you're a giant hipster, go here:) the quality is excellent, the vibe is trendy (in all it's dark wood and metal accents, with some great pops of corrugated metal at the bar). END
BEGIN NOW    This place is a major thumbs up, bring your friends and it'll be a great time!. END
BEGIN NOW    I am glad I like this place because it's literally across the street from me. END
BEGIN NOW     Be aware it gets PACKED and it's really not the place to just drop in for a beer on the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW     They are really particular where you sit too so aside from the bar you must check in with the host/hostess. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is good however a bit overpriced but the pretzel is huge and very reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW     But you're really coming her for the beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW     Let me say that again-- the beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW     A ton of time goes into crafting this and you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW     Everyone working there knows a ton and will recommend and let you tastes everything first. END
BEGIN NOW     I miss the little shuffle board they used to have but they totally needed the space given how popular Hog's has become. END
BEGIN NOW     It's great for the neighborhood and I am a big fan. END
BEGIN NOW    Bacon. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     Fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     Millions of local brew on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     This man I know, who I call Lester, not his real name, of course, who is from the great state of Iowa, would have loved this place like hog in mud. END
BEGIN NOW     My pre-race meal. END
BEGIN NOW     It was very children friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I unfortunately was having a discussion with my dining partner about why men always cheat when a young couple with young children sat down. END
BEGIN NOW     Yes it was a communal table style. END
BEGIN NOW     So conversation of controversy could be overheard. END
BEGIN NOW     Though I should not apologize for we have freedom of speech here and plus I know I am right. END
BEGIN NOW     I am the confession chamber to many guy friends who cheat but feel guilty. END
BEGIN NOW    Social commentary aside, this is kind of restaurant that serves the food for the people. END
BEGIN NOW     Basic yet upscale. END
BEGIN NOW     Possibly the best fried chicken with collard greens I have ever eaten. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the pork shoulder with grits, delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretzel with two kinds of gourmet mustard, yum. END
BEGIN NOW     But, the most surprising thing was the apple and celery root soup called fruit and root soup. END
BEGIN NOW     Creamy, yes, but also very light and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     Very girlie dish I think. END
BEGIN NOW     I think the sausages looked great. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to come back to try the local brew. END
BEGIN NOW     Very fashionable. END
BEGIN NOW     This place felt a bit Midwestern and a bit of the South, and slightly Brooklyn. END
BEGIN NOW     Oakland is having a moment. END
BEGIN NOW     I sort of kind of want to share my finds with everyone. END
BEGIN NOW     Time to make some new friends so I can show them how Oaklanders do food. END
BEGIN NOW    We arrived early for our reservation so sat at the bar where we enjoyed some of the amazing beers they have on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     The service and atmosphere was so great we decided to just fine at the bar and what a treat. END
BEGIN NOW     We had bar snacks of olives and spicy pork crackling - both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     Next the chickfritz which made me wish I could cook so well. END
BEGIN NOW     For our main we shared the shrimp and grits - let's say I had to strongly resist licking the plate! Final course was the pumpkin and pretzel donuts with a custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll admit to drinking what was left of the custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     The donuts themselves were packed with flavor and delightfully moist. END
BEGIN NOW     Finally did I mention the beer selection? Great choice of local small brews, many of which I love so glad Hogs supports them. END
BEGIN NOW     I will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW    Wasn't impressed with the food or service,but the place looks nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW    This area is infested with hipsters and there's nothing to complain about that. END
BEGIN NOW     This restaurant is exactly what this area needed! Craft beer galore. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a more intimate hipster place with cafeteria tables and a bar stools all around (they really want you to start talking to the strangers). END
BEGIN NOW     What I lovvvvveeee is the style and the Devore of this place. END
BEGIN NOW     The plentiful of windows and the high ceilings. END
BEGIN NOW     It really comfortable here. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a huge selection of craft beer all over the east Bay Area as well as out of town beers. END
BEGIN NOW    For now I only tried their hot dogs and pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel was good! Nice and soft and really big enough for two. END
BEGIN NOW     Just AVOID dipping a huge piece into their yellow home made mustard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     It taste like wasabi. END
BEGIN NOW     As for the hotdog, Jamaican Jerk Off. END
BEGIN NOW     It was ok. END
BEGIN NOW     The Bun broke off cause it was so soft. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausage was good. END
BEGIN NOW     The vegetable they added on top didn't chop off well with the bite. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean it's a hot dog, so simple but they made it so complex that it was hard to understand why. END
BEGIN NOW     I would come back again for the beer for sure. END
BEGIN NOW    Went there again recently and was actually amazed by the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Had mussels and some kind of fabulous salad and vegetable fritter thing. END
BEGIN NOW     It was so fresh, interesting and delicious! (Yes. END
BEGIN NOW     I licked the plate. END
BEGIN NOW    ) Sometimes it's just a matter of respecting your own culinary boundaries and finding the right thing to eat. END
BEGIN NOW     And of course, enjoying The Hog's creative and excellent execution. END
BEGIN NOW    Not sure what's going on but we have been sitting here for 30 minutes! We came in and the waitress took our beer order. END
BEGIN NOW     10 minutes later got our beers! She never came back walked around helping all 10 people in the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW     Trying to flag her down no eye contact smh. END
BEGIN NOW     Well at least my dead canary is good. END
BEGIN NOW     oh boy she walked by again!! Check please I guess we can't try the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Let me change it to one star even ride when asking for the check!!. END
BEGIN NOW    I came here during restaurant week and it was pretty busy. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was great and the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW    Excellent beer selection Slowish service, only had maybe 1 or 2 waitstaff for a  busy Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW     I was going to order the corn app but thankfully I was told it was essentially corn nuts. END
BEGIN NOW    Pistachio mortadella was goodPork  crackling was deliciousShrimp grits were absolutely fantasticCorn dog was extremely dissapointing, the breading fell apart and wasn't crispy or thick enough and the sausage was bleh. END
BEGIN NOW    Sorry, but don't believe the hype. END
BEGIN NOW     Although Hog's is a guiding light for the Temescal gentrification movement, the service is kind of pretentious dudes old timey haircuts and ironic t-shirts, the food is meh, and the vibe is kind of wack. END
BEGIN NOW     Thanks for the $7. END
BEGIN NOW    50 beer and microwaved pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     Wah-wahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW    You know, I found the menu very hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe I went at the wrong time of the day? But we were only offered a bar menu and it was not straight forward. END
BEGIN NOW     I felt almost intimidated trying to figure out why we had to de-code it. END
BEGIN NOW     We had to ask the waitress a few times what is what and how we get what we want. END
BEGIN NOW     She seemed at awe why we would ask suchhhh questions but then she served us marinated olives from a MASON jar. END
BEGIN NOW     That was when I figured out we were going to be spending money on cool instead of food, so we nibbled and left. END
BEGIN NOW     I may or may not stick my head in another time, just to see if their regular dinner menu will not be served on burlap or a birds nest. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant itself is very pretty though!. END
BEGIN NOW    I went here with two of my friends for Oakland Restaurant Week; unfortunately, we came at dinner and the offer was not available! Bummer! You walk in, and there is a bar, benches (Biergarten status), and stools around the edges. END
BEGIN NOW     The decor was nice and even featured a giant hog. END
BEGIN NOW     FOOD: We got the meatball appetizer and I got the Extras sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends got the Area 51 and the Kielbasa. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     The food comes with freshly made chips and pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips were HEAVILY salted that I felt that it was just not good. END
BEGIN NOW     Please hold back on the salt. END
BEGIN NOW     Veggies were fine. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausage combo itself was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW     DRINK:I got a double IPA. END
BEGIN NOW     The place has a lot of beer options and are constantly rotating with choices, so beer options are great here. END
BEGIN NOW     SERVICE: I was pleased with the service. END
BEGIN NOW     Our waitress was attentive, but nothing spectacular, but our food and drinks come out in within a reasonable amount of time. END
BEGIN NOW     Although, she took away our full water pitcher and gave it to another party. END
BEGIN NOW     I was confused, but mistakes like that happen. END
BEGIN NOW     OVERALL:To sum it up, very expensive, which probably is why it's 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     For what I ate, the quality, and all, I don't see how I can justify $14 for a "sandwich" (a hot dog). END
BEGIN NOW     We were content with the place at the end of the night, but believed the price and quality disparity was too big. END
BEGIN NOW    I changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW     (after my last visit)Smarmy host. END
BEGIN NOW     Over priced food. END
BEGIN NOW     Yacky, pretentious &amp; droning hipster wannabes. END
BEGIN NOW     It's downright annoying. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not going back. END
BEGIN NOW     'tis a shame. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW    oh well. END
BEGIN NOW    Great place to get a drink, and the food (at least, our pretzels) is great! They have a large variety of beers. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the red flight, everyone else had lighter beers. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer and the pretzels were all amazing!. END
BEGIN NOW    Quick stop for a snack before heading out to a late dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selections were pretty impressive! Decided to try the Hock &amp; Trotter Terrine - could use a bit of seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW     The flavors didn't mix in together as well as we expected it to. END
BEGIN NOW     Still overall satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW    Despite passing by this place several times on my trek to Piedmont, I had never set foot in The Hog's Apothecary until this evening. END
BEGIN NOW     I had always felt a tad bit put off by the name, as I am a strict vee-gan. END
BEGIN NOW     Their menu didn't seem to be very veg-friendly (rather, not at all). END
BEGIN NOW     However, my friend Lindsey (also a veg) brought me here, and I thought it was pretty neat, as far as bars go. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried the Societe beer flight this evening ($10), which featured tantalizing names for each brew: The Harlot, The Debutante, and The Widow. END
BEGIN NOW     All three of the beers hailed from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was a touch unfriendly, but I've come to expect that same surliness with hipster locales in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW     The dining area and bar were both pretty jam-packed, so the host placed us, standing, at a counter by the window. END
BEGIN NOW     The server seemed to dislike this placement, but where else were we to go? I think I would have bumped this one up to a 5 if the staff had took initiative and found us a table. END
BEGIN NOW     Even so, at the end of the day, all of the beers I tasted were delicious, and I would definitely return to sample more of their cold beverages. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambiance here is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer is delicious and food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzels with wasabi mustard sauce really opens your airway and taste so good. END
BEGIN NOW    Been here for lunch and dinner now and it's been great!  The menu is limited but with enough choices and diversity for everyone to be able to find something. END
BEGIN NOW      Extensive beer menu but I dont think liquor. END
BEGIN NOW      Seating is communal on some tables to be ready to rub elbows with a stranger. END
BEGIN NOW      Looking forward to going back as they update their menu. END
BEGIN NOW    Loudest restaurant I've ever been in making the experience uncomfortable right as it began. END
BEGIN NOW      The cracklins were chewy, not really crunchy, and didn't have any pork flavor to it. END
BEGIN NOW      The terrine was too subtle and came on bread which tasted like it was a day old. END
BEGIN NOW      My Versace sausage was one of the better ones I've had, well seasoned and juicy with a good kick, served on a soft bun which tasted kind of like a Hawaiian roll. END
BEGIN NOW     The potato chips were fine but nothing special, reminds me of in-n-out fries which are "more fresh" but also just don't taste as good as other stuff you find. END
BEGIN NOW    Overall a pretty average meal in an unpleasant setting. END
BEGIN NOW    Wow! Literally the best benedict I ever had, and from a gastropub no less. END
BEGIN NOW      The meat was amazing and the egg was perfectly poached. END
BEGIN NOW      Excellent job! And I'm typically someone who is very particular with it comes to breakfast (I have a sous vide at home so it's hard to beat sous vide eggs). END
BEGIN NOW      Plus great beer selection on top of that!. END
BEGIN NOW    Had a nice lunch here with a mimosa and a "Vietnamese" sausage sandwich with an egg on it. END
BEGIN NOW     quite good. END
BEGIN NOW     You sit at communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe next time we come here for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW    We came back for dinner to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (dropped in without a reservation) and in almost no time at all, we were seated in the exact same place as our first visit back in July. END
BEGIN NOW     We had the same server, AND she remembered us! Pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The blue cheese stuffed figs are not on the menu currently but they make some damn good steak (with blue cheese BUTTER!!! WOWWWW) and fries. END
BEGIN NOW     I loved looking around the restaurant while we were eating and seeing how the staff all interacted with each other - laughing, talking, and at one point I looked up in time to see someone down half a glass of beer. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't mean to imply they're unprofessional; rather I get the impression that people that work here love being around each other and working together in an environment that they enjoy, which definitely makes for a fun dining experience. END
BEGIN NOW     If we lived closer (and made a bit more money) I'd want to be regulars. END
BEGIN NOW    Seriously guys, if you're ever in the area, skip the crowds waiting outside Homeroom (although I also love that place) and just go about a block up for some of the best dishes in the east bay. END
BEGIN NOW    Brunched here twice and the food has been delectable:Softshell crab Benedict - I snapped that up the moment I saw it, and so glad I did because it wasn't on the menu the next time I went here!  It was just as good I imagined it would be, plus the potatoes on the side were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    Savory waffle + fried chicken - I had this with both gravy and syrup, and really it should be done no other way. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried chicken was boneless (all the easier to inhale you with, my dear), moist on the inside, crunchy but not greasy on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffles were cornmeal-y, also with the perfect amount of crispness most becoming of a waffle. END
BEGIN NOW      Have this dipped in syrup, and then the next bite smeared with gravy, then a bite of chicken, and so forth. END
BEGIN NOW      I can guarantee the couple next to you who hasn't gotten their entrees yet will be slightly uncomfortable at you and your spouse's eating moans. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      I would say in the summer be prepared for a cold drink along with everything else. END
BEGIN NOW    Waltzed in here with a reservation for 2, just in case, on a Sunday morning for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Upon first observation, this place is bright, open and cute!! Community tables for the social people and a few private tables for people like me. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend opted for the Pastrami Benedict with Schmaltz Potatoes and I went for the Fried Chicken and Spring Onion Waffles with Huckleberry Jam. END
BEGIN NOW     Let's not forget the mimosas, a brunch requirement. END
BEGIN NOW     Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     That is all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW     Hands down best chicken and waffles I've had so far. END
BEGIN NOW     And I've had a lot. END
BEGIN NOW     No bones! I'm all about bones and meat handles but you know there be places that give you only skin and bones. END
BEGIN NOW     Just meat baby. END
BEGIN NOW     Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm salivating just thinking about it. END
BEGIN NOW     And those schmaltzy potatoes?! I stole them off my friends plate. END
BEGIN NOW     So damn good. END
BEGIN NOW     That flavor! I can't get over this place!. END
BEGIN NOW    This is one of our go-to brunch spots in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is great and we love the space with beautiful light big community tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Some of our favorites include the French Madame, the schmaltzy potatoes, the Royale with cheese. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is always friendly, great customer service. END
BEGIN NOW    Hipster is probably the best way to describe this place. END
BEGIN NOW     The concept, the staff, the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     This is something that you would expect in Portland - but none of this is necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW    My friend up in Oakland had reached out to me, and while looking at reviews for the Trappist, a mention about the Hog's Apothecary caught my eye. END
BEGIN NOW     Fortunately the place was a few blocks from my friend and close to my sister. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend has wanted to try this place, and I was curious. END
BEGIN NOW    We showed up to standing room only - a good sign. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend put her name down with a 30 minute wait, and we found a space to look over the beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Really impressive, local menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Some things I've tried, but there was plenty that I had never even seen before. END
BEGIN NOW     Started with the 1903 Pre-Prohibition Style American Lager, which was delicious, and intelligently the beers got added to the menu tab for when we sat. END
BEGIN NOW    Not even 10 minutes later we got a seat. END
BEGIN NOW     Other than the bar, the place features long tables with benches. END
BEGIN NOW     Herein lies the one of problem I see with this place: getting in and up from these benches if you have a middle seat and they are already packed. END
BEGIN NOW     I eventually maneuvered in, but it wasn't easy. END
BEGIN NOW    The possibly daily-changing menu was confusing to say the least. END
BEGIN NOW     I still have no idea what Arlo Shirks or Olin Browns are. END
BEGIN NOW     I get it, hipster. END
BEGIN NOW     But don't make things difficult on your servers and the patrons - call shit out, like everything else on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW    Regardless, I went the sausage sandwich route that the person sitting next to me also did: a Darkwing (duck and pork sausage with some kind of delicious greens on top) and the fried grits side. END
BEGIN NOW     The Darkwing was delicious and hearty, the chips very flavorful, as were the white veggie side. END
BEGIN NOW     The fried grits were also delicious, but the sausage was big enough that I barely got a dent into the grits. END
BEGIN NOW    Before leaving my friend and I each ordered one of the daily flights: she went with wheat, I went with hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW     The Daphne was delicious, but definitely more on the crisp summer day variety of hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW    I could definitely see coming back, and if I lived in the area, the beers alone might make this a recurring stop. END
BEGIN NOW     Some of the entrees are a bit on the pricey side, but fortunately there are some cheap options so you don't break the bank. END
BEGIN NOW    Great food and rotating taps. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is also wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW      I visit often and love their brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW    A certain someone wanted to try this place for over 4 months now. END
BEGIN NOW    Here we are at this place with all the open space in the world, but to only see two communal tables in the middle of the room and bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW      Trying to squeezed us into the edge of the communal table (H-E-L-L to the NO!). END
BEGIN NOW     We opted to wait for the bar stools instead. END
BEGIN NOW    With minimal selections, we nibble on some chickpea fritters and meatballs before scarfing down our Moroccan lambs sandwich and hot dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Nothing spectacular about the food when all you're given was some pickles and potato chips to go along with your meal. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not looking to return to this place but maybe one day along the line. END
BEGIN NOW     In fairness, their service was on point and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW    Solid food, great atmosphere and interesting beer list. END
BEGIN NOW     The pretzel is a must. END
BEGIN NOW     Sausages are good. END
BEGIN NOW     Fried chicken is good. END
BEGIN NOW     Totally worth while. END
BEGIN NOW     Though I dig it it's not a place that's like a total package for me meaning I would suggest it, but I wouldn't go outta my way to go there. END
BEGIN NOW     It is for sure one of the better spots in that few block radius - not that there are many. END
BEGIN NOW    Went "cheap" with the Corn Dog ($8) and asked for a recommendation for the 3 small Charcuterie items. END
BEGIN NOW     The waitress recommended the Pork Terrine ($6). END
BEGIN NOW    The terrine comes with toasted slices of Barkada baguette, whole grain mustard, pickle, and olive (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW     Despite having visible herbs it was pretty bland on it's own and definitely needed the mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW    The Corn Dog was superb. END
BEGIN NOW     It's huge and served with lard-y chips, pickles, ketchup and yellow mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW    com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW     Strong smokey flavor from the hot dog. END
BEGIN NOW     The chips were all crisp, an improvement from my last visit. END
BEGIN NOW    They need to beef up the little skewer you can see on the left side of my picture. END
BEGIN NOW     I first picked the corn dog up with that and it immediately bent and cracked under the weight of the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW    Went to check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was okay but service was bad. END
BEGIN NOW    Duck was dry. END
BEGIN NOW     Nothing special about the fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     Meatballs were great!!But our server, maybe she was having a bad day, but really inattentive. END
BEGIN NOW      She never came and checked in if I wanted another beer. END
BEGIN NOW     When taking our order she literally left before my friend placed his order. END
BEGIN NOW     She took my order then turned around and left as he was about to place his order. END
BEGIN NOW     He had to track her down and give her his order. END
BEGIN NOW     And she never returned to check how our meals were. END
BEGIN NOW     It became comical but she was not a good server. END
BEGIN NOW     I wasn't impressed enough to return. END
BEGIN NOW     Think it's a lot of hype. END
BEGIN NOW    Here's the thing: the food is sadly only 2-2 and a half stars, but the excellent service bumps it up to three stars. END
BEGIN NOW     1) the fried chicken was covered in gravy. END
BEGIN NOW     Like too much and took away from the crispness. END
BEGIN NOW     No flavor to the batter really and kinda bland. END
BEGIN NOW     Meh. END
BEGIN NOW     2) the corn dog- gf got it and I tried. END
BEGIN NOW     Also just not as good as it looked. END
BEGIN NOW     3) fried pickle appetizers were solid though. END
BEGIN NOW     4) great beer selection I will confirm. END
BEGIN NOW    I was sooo excited to try HA. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm so disappointed that our experience left us irritated &amp; disgusted. END
BEGIN NOW     There was literally 4 other patrons there when we walked in at 5:25pm. END
BEGIN NOW    at 5:30 dinner started &amp; 5 more parties walked in. END
BEGIN NOW    we got outta there at 6pm with NO food order since EVERYONE got service before we did. END
BEGIN NOW     I was appalled no one even stopped by to check how we were doing with our beer that was ordered at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Funny enough there was a black guy at the bar that was there before we got there that no one was checking on either!!!! The food smelled so good but they weren't getting another cent from me. END
BEGIN NOW    they went outta their way to avoid making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW      Make sure you look hipster enough if you want any service from Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW    you just messed with the wrong ONE!. END
BEGIN NOW    Super yummi y'all! Best fired chicken I ever had (albeit probably the smallest portion). END
BEGIN NOW     Their Wiener schnitzel was incredible and I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW    This place has an incredible beer list. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selector knows their stuff. END
BEGIN NOW     Always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I live fairly close to this spot so I frequent this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Hogs does not have anything I eat ( because I'm vegan) but the service, ant the staff are great, so I come anyways. END
BEGIN NOW     My man loves their sausages and I just like the place. END
BEGIN NOW     Good beer and great staff and I like the design of the place. END
BEGIN NOW    Was looking forward to trying this place as I like beer and pork, and it's within walking distance to my home. END
BEGIN NOW      Came with a small  group on a very quiet night (maybe 6 or 7 customers besides us), but was underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a good beer and intended to eat, but was put off by the service. END
BEGIN NOW     Example: When I asked the guy behind the bar if a certain beer was good, rather than a friendly "Yes", and maybe describing it, he just dryly said "Define good". END
BEGIN NOW      Really? You're gonna just throw it back at the customer with two words to prove how cool and indifferent you are?More than one examples of dickish attitude meant we left after one beer each, and a tab that was less than 1/5 of what was likely as we intended to stay for more beers and dinner, but I guess they "won" because they seemed intent on not making us feel welcome and they achieved it. END
BEGIN NOW    In the Yelp listing, it says "Ambience: Hipster" and that's accurate. END
BEGIN NOW      Judging from the snarky/snotty service, it seems they Hog's Apothecary thinks that's a compliment. END
BEGIN NOW     In my experience, even hipsters don't like to think of themselves as such. END
BEGIN NOW     (Are there really people out there who say, "Hipster? I'm there!")This place needs to get over itself and act like they're happy you're there. END
BEGIN NOW      The fact that they don't bother to respond to their Yelp reviews seems to be another example of them thinking they're too cool to care. END
BEGIN NOW    When you see the word "apothecary" in their name, you just know it's gonna be hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      So much so, that I kept feeling like I was in a Portland joint. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe it was the drizzle outside, maybe the multiple sightings of flannels and beards, whatever it may be, I was down with it. END
BEGIN NOW      This place is simple yet legit. END
BEGIN NOW      A new American Beer Hall is how they deem themselves and I like it. END
BEGIN NOW    Started with a black beer mixed with pinot noir from Moonlight in Santa Rosa and it was super unique. END
BEGIN NOW      Not bad but not something I would want multiples of. END
BEGIN NOW      You can definitely taste the wine. END
BEGIN NOW      Noshed on their bar ready *spicy* pork cracklings and they were incredibly light and sticky on the tooth. END
BEGIN NOW      And spicy was a bit of an understatement, it stung like a mutha. END
BEGIN NOW      I suppose they want you to order another beer. END
BEGIN NOW    A salad of tender butter lettuce, chopped beets, hipster rainbow radishes and a nice blue cheese dressing is a nice starter. END
BEGIN NOW      At $10 it is quite spittable. END
BEGIN NOW    Zsa Zsa $14 is an amazing sausage sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW      A Hungarian style which is like a kielbasa on steroids. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't know if they make their own sausage but this was one helluva meat specimen in tube form. END
BEGIN NOW      It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      Unique toasted bread, a fresh herb/oil spread and thick cut potato chips. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh I'd grow a hipster beard for this if I could, but I can't, so darn it to hell. END
BEGIN NOW    Hanger Steak $26 was spot on bistro fare. END
BEGIN NOW      Tender bloody meat, blue cheese sauce, sautéed greens and potato gratin. END
BEGIN NOW      Very assertive flavors and if you love beef, this will not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW      Only thing was it came out lukewarm and within a minute it was basically cold. END
BEGIN NOW      But now with a dry hopped steam beer from Petaluma, all was good. END
BEGIN NOW    Like the hood, like the brews, like the staff and like the food. END
BEGIN NOW      What's not to like?!  This place is a total score. END
BEGIN NOW    I am adding an update because I received a note from one of the other bartenders that I have never experienced and he told me to come back when he was working and apologized for the bad experience I had. END
BEGIN NOW    I stopped in late for an after climbing beer and saw that he was behind the bar so I went in. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a delicious beer, drank my beer and went on my way. END
BEGIN NOW    I was impressed and very pleased by his service and have gone back twice when I see he is working. END
BEGIN NOW     He is definitely the gem of that place and like going in for a late night beer when he is working!. END
BEGIN NOW    The beer selection is excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      The food, unfortunately, is mediocre and overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd be there more often if the waiters weren't so snotty and on top of you. END
BEGIN NOW      They'll get very pissy if you don't order food, even if it's early evening and the place is barely half full. END
BEGIN NOW    I want to love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I live a block away away and I want to come, all the time, and to love it. END
BEGIN NOW     However, due to the poor service I've received on more than one occasion and the clear lack of vegetarian/vegan options I feel forced to give a less than satisfactory review. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm usually fine with ordering the hot pretzel, which to be fair is awesome, and having one (or two or three) of the amazing beers available, and call it an excellent night. END
BEGIN NOW     However, on more than one occasion, I've experienced snobby and/or snarky service, which I find quite uncool (I've worked in customer service for over 20 years and know what it's like to give and receive genuinely warm, welcoming, and helpful service). END
BEGIN NOW    I'll start with the good-often times I've had great servers who were attentive, polite, and top-notch. END
BEGIN NOW     I've had numerous fantastic beers and beer suggestions and a handful of excellent salads and desserts. END
BEGIN NOW     However, more than once I've come across employees who were were way less than helpful, and at times, snarky. END
BEGIN NOW     Boo. END
BEGIN NOW    Me on a Friday night around 6pm: "Hi, I'd love to grab a quick drink"Hostess (with warmth of of a rock): "There's no room at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    "Me: "Oh, see there's a spot by the window, can I take that [which they let me have any other night of the week]?"Hostess: "Some people are waiting for those. END
BEGIN NOW    "Ok, I can't have a quick beer in the meantime? You can't say in a friendly tone, 'you're welcome to wait until something opens up. END
BEGIN NOW    ?'Frustrated, I left and decided to go across town where I felt more welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     I drove by about 15 minutes later (on my way to said place a cross town), and there was still no one in the seat I had asked for (I could see from the huge windows) Glad you keep it for them! (I would have been done, paid, and and out of the seat by then). END
BEGIN NOW    My next experience: on a Sunday night in which I sit at the bar then ask the bartender if any of the sides are vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW     His reply: "Have you seen the name of this place? We can always make you a vegetarian plate if you wish. END
BEGIN NOW    " Thanks, but why the need for a snarky opening? I could reply, and did: you are a business in vey hipster neighborhood full of vegans and vegetarians. END
BEGIN NOW     It's unfortunate that you're not more friendly to those diets. END
BEGIN NOW     He has the audacity to debate with me, which is when I start writing this review. END
BEGIN NOW    On a positive note, when I'm done with my beer the seemingly manager apologizes for any negativity and offers to pay for me beer. END
BEGIN NOW     Thanks buddy! You've kept the door open for another chance. END
BEGIN NOW    Give 'en a try if you're there for a full, non-vegetarian dinner. END
BEGIN NOW     You may really like it! And, if they shape up a bit and tune in to their local clientele and the general requests of their customers, I'll be back on a regular basis. END
BEGIN NOW    Great service and awesome food. END
BEGIN NOW     Have to admit that I was a bit weary going here with all the reviews about too cool for school hipster servers and I am happy to report that hipster is the only true adjective. END
BEGIN NOW    We were a group of five plus one baby and they were very accomodating, making sure that we had the right spot where the kiddo wouldn't be knocked over. END
BEGIN NOW    Food was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     We scarfed down the soft pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW      Fried chicken was good but not amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     True to the name, anything with a casing is worth ordering and order one of everything!. END
BEGIN NOW    I think the food is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW      I have been known to be a less than adventurous eater so i must point out that everything I have had has had me in awe. END
BEGIN NOW      Love love the always rotating, fresh craft brew selection and they have a couple wines that are de-lish as well as a sparkling for those not into beer. END
BEGIN NOW    I must comment on the 2 star review:  You went to an establishment practically named "pork incorporated" and were surprised at the lack of vegetarian options?  And they preceded to tell you they are always happy to make a vegetarian friendly dish on order (I've overheard them offer this to people and thought that was very accommodating!) and you are still less than thrilled with their service?  And if the local clientele is not being represented with such an establishment, then why are they packed regularly and why did another butchery restaurant open just up the block?. END
BEGIN NOW    Finally had a chance to try this place out as I don't live in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     What a gem! We tried several items on the menu and all to a dish were superbly thought out, created, plated and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      My favorite by far was the charcuterie . END
BEGIN NOW     all made in house of course. END
BEGIN NOW    Beyond the food, the beer list is extensive and eclectic. END
BEGIN NOW      From what the owners said, constantly rotating as well so I'd encourage frequent visits to sample them all of course. END
BEGIN NOW     They also work directly with breweries rather than through distributors when possible so you know care is taken regarding freshness. END
BEGIN NOW     If I lived closer, I'd own a "mug". END
BEGIN NOW    And the atmosphere! Warm. END
BEGIN NOW     Inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     Family friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Not too loud but still fun and great for groups. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff was very service oriented and the chef/owner is constantly circulating the room and ensuring everyone has a fantastic experience. END
BEGIN NOW    The rapini here is arugalized in-house, and their delicious pea tendrils are wilted to order. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't forget to slather the Yemeni skhug on your quatre epices for that extra kick of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW    Tl;dr: the menu is unrelentingly pretentious, and using inductive reasoning, my party determined all hot dogs are indistinguishable from one another. END
BEGIN NOW    The Hog's . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW     . END
BEGIN NOW    is a nice addition to the flourishing Beer Garden trend that is finally catching up to the rest of the USA. END
BEGIN NOW      Yet this one the lacks the actual outdoor experience one would expect of a traditional Beer Garden. END
BEGIN NOW      Nevertheless, there are many things to like about this one. END
BEGIN NOW      Well, of course the beer selections are very satisfactory ranging from imports and domestics on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      The food delights wells especially the Terrines or the Hogs Head Cheese and and the Charcuteries. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing too extraordinary here, but the mains and started complement the beer selection nicely. END
BEGIN NOW      However, avoid the mostly unsparing sides like the Brussels sprouts,  etc. END
BEGIN NOW      More time was put into describing them than preparing them, so theylive on this menu as an afterthought. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is rustic, modern and pleasing ,but it hard to have a conversation here at the larger tables where you nearly have to yell to be hard. END
BEGIN NOW      So if you want something quieter and more chatty, sit by the windows. END
BEGIN NOW    Good food, great service, but this place is so incredibly overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW      $27 for two tiny pieces of fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      $16 for a tiny salad?  Totally ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW      But delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm from San Diego and this is my second visit to the Hog. END
BEGIN NOW      Both times I have had an exceptional time!!  The customer service and beer selection are outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW      The first time I was there Nicole took great care of this out-of-towner and I knew I had to go back. END
BEGIN NOW      Megan in the bar was super awesome and she really knew her beer. END
BEGIN NOW      She paired me up with a great beer that I probably couldn't have picked of myself. END
BEGIN NOW      After that, Marie, Alice and Christy took over and things were consistently great from there. END
BEGIN NOW      The rainbow heirloom was too good to describe in words, so you might want to go down there in person and try it for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW      Every time I'm in Oakland Im stopping by for sure. END
BEGIN NOW      Thanks for the extra Burrata guys!!  Keep up the good work!!. END
BEGIN NOW    Returned for breakfast and was thrilled to see the Benedict back on the menu, this time with pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW     Combined with the schmaltzy potatoes it is just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     And as previously mentioned the iced coffee is delicious, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. END
BEGIN NOW    service was ridiculously slow! I swear there was one. END
BEGIN NOW     MAYBE two people working and the place was packed! I had the corn dog and I like mustard but that stuff was gross, wayy to spicyoverall just not my kind of restaurant i would recommend going just for a beer due to the large selection but the service would keep from going even for that. END
BEGIN NOW    This is my friend's favorite spot so we've eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks and a dozen, or more, times over the last 4 months. END
BEGIN NOW      The host and servers are always helpful, knowledgable and accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW      They make most everything in house, so they can tell you about all of the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       This has been super helpful over the last few weeks because I'm doing the Whole30 diet that requires I not partake in a whole host of ingredients (including no added sugar to anything). END
BEGIN NOW      I've had the same super awesome server the last 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW      She knows what I need and has been incredibly accommodating and helpful in working with the kitchen to help me eat there. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend enjoys trying different beers and every server we've had has happily help him choose the best bear to go with his meal. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm don't drinker beer but they've even helped me find one or two that I like (before I was doing the Whole30). END
BEGIN NOW    If you're looking for friendly service, good solid food and a great beer selection this is a place you should try. END
BEGIN NOW    Beer selection can't be beat, and a knowledgeable staff to guide you thru it. END
BEGIN NOW      Menu is meat heavy as expected, and isn't approachable for everyone. END
BEGIN NOW      However the flavors are incredible and every meal I've had there has been delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Great location for MacArthur BART and I'll be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Large hearty portions, really tasty and comforting. END
BEGIN NOW     Great selection of beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The service however has room for improvement - can never seem to catch the eye of the one server on the floor at 7pm on a Sunday (who whisked away our water bottle in an attempt to refill it, then forgot to return it until we flagged her down to ask about the bottle's whereabouts). END
BEGIN NOW     The squirrely host is no help either - eyes only looking at the silverware he was setting down. END
BEGIN NOW    Have now been to Hog's 3 times, and I have been beyond impressed every time. END
BEGIN NOW     My fancy beer friends are always stoked with the selection of beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     Being more of a wine girl, I really like that selection is as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was DELISH! The summer gems salad was fresh and tasty time. END
BEGIN NOW     The heirloom tomatoes were also super tasty, and the Italian Sausage KILLED IT. END
BEGIN NOW     Go to Hogs, go now. END
BEGIN NOW    Got there for a reservation at 7:30 pm were seated at 8:20pCouldn't hear or think beyond the noise and music. END
BEGIN NOW    Fish dish was dry  and bland. END
BEGIN NOW    Man, this place is awesome!! I came here for the first time a couple days ago and just had to go back last night. END
BEGIN NOW     I found out about the Hog when I decided to Yelp for corn dog places around the bay. END
BEGIN NOW     When this place popped up, I bookmarked it and knew that this place was going to be a winner (have you SEEN the pictures of that sucker?!). END
BEGIN NOW     Located on the corner of Shafter and 40th about a block away from Homeroom, this place is a great location for a quick dinner or to catch up with some friends. END
BEGIN NOW     During the visits, my girlfriend and I got to try their kielbasa ("Who's your Basa?"), corn dog, roasted peppers, and delicious as all-hell potato chips (that are fried in their own pig lard! Yes!!). END
BEGIN NOW     The Hog has a hefty beer collection on tap with relatively lesser-known breweries. END
BEGIN NOW     We met up with a friend and all got to try an IPA with wild rice, imperial IPA, several saisons and a couple of stouts. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't recall the exact number of beers that they have on tap, but it's a very impressive number considering some places in the area only serve up about 10. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're coming here for dinner, make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to just sit at the bar, which really isn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW     The music here is BITCHIN, so prepare to eat good food, drink tasty beer, and groove to some dope music. END
BEGIN NOW    Look, I know that as a vegetarian in a place called "Hog's Apothecary" (or "Hog's" anything else for that matter), I have little right to complain about a lack of food options not made from a pig. END
BEGIN NOW      So I'll only note here that if you are a vegetarian (or keep Kosher or Halal), you are not going to find food here for you. END
BEGIN NOW    We only came here for beer anyway, so I'm not holding it against them. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambiance here is cool-- very Oakland hip. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of beer options, so, there's that. END
BEGIN NOW      Greeter and server and person who finally brought our beers were very nice. END
BEGIN NOW    But I was not that impressed with the beer we had in 2 different flights (so that's 6 different beers--multiple opportunities for good beer), and it took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order once we had sat down. END
BEGIN NOW      We actually gave up we were sitting there so long and finally just went to the bar to order there. END
BEGIN NOW      The place isn't that big and didn't have that many people, but it seems like they didn't have enough servers for the space, and so our nice server lady badly neglected us. END
BEGIN NOW      It's two stars for me on this not because it's a bad place in and of itself but because for Oakland, it's a definite "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW     I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW    "  It definitely did not live up to the hype; neither, for me, did it live up to comparisons/experiences/and-mainly-the-beer of Beer Revolution or The Trappist. END
BEGIN NOW    But I'm going to guess that if you like pork with random potentially-not-great-beer that this place is going to be the bee's knees for you. END
BEGIN NOW      Or the pork knees, as it were. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are a beer lover and find yourself in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in here. END
BEGIN NOW     The extensive (mostly local) draft beer list is impressive and is varied enough to keep the whole group happy. END
BEGIN NOW     Our group of 4 started standing by the window while we waited for some seating to open up. END
BEGIN NOW     We then sat at one of the large shared tables in the middle of the restaurant, where we shared a couple bits/starters and two of the house sausages (which are huge). END
BEGIN NOW     Great/lively ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW    Sorry guys! Have always loved the food and amazing draft list but. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill out on the rules. END
BEGIN NOW     The last three times we've been there our experience has been soured by weird overstepping of bar/seating arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW     I've invited multiple guests who've felt snubbed by this. END
BEGIN NOW     I. END
BEGIN NOW    e. END
BEGIN NOW     tonight for my birthday after work our table was approached and I was told we were expected to spend more money on food not just drinks and would have been sat somewhere different. END
BEGIN NOW     This was an odd and somewhat rude admission in light of each person ordering over $30 in drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     I appreciate the attempt to keep the most efficient flow going through the restaurant but the second your patrons feel like pigs led through a feeding trough, you've lost an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't drink beer often but I had a fun time experimenting with the beer menu and having our waitress pick out drinks for me based on my preferences. END
BEGIN NOW      The Harlot (a Belgian pale ale) was my favorite, and given that I overheard a few other parties ordering it, my sense is that it's a pretty popular choice. END
BEGIN NOW    I enjoyed everything we ordered (pork cracklins, meatballs, summer bean ragout and mixed grill) except for the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW      The hot dog tasted overly smokey and burnt to the point where I couldn't really taste the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW      This was highly disappointing because I love corn dogs, but I still recommend coming here for the other dishes, beer selection and attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW    After a rocky first visit (nothing to do with the food), I'm now a HUGE HOG FAN. END
BEGIN NOW     The cod fritters were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     The fried chicken rocked our world. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was charming and I really appreciated the owners reaching out. END
BEGIN NOW     They've totally solved any service problem they had. END
BEGIN NOW    Food:Spicy Pork Cracklin's - Don't get it, it's not very good. END
BEGIN NOW      It doesn't taste like "real" cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW    Belgian-Braised Pork Shoulder - This is a winner. END
BEGIN NOW      For $27, you make the value proposition on this one. END
BEGIN NOW    Choucroute Garnie - It's exactly what it is albeit I was expecting more meat. END
BEGIN NOW      I think there were 4 meat selections and more saurkraut. END
BEGIN NOW      A great plus is that one of the meats is their duck, which is DELISH!  If I compare it to others that I've tried, this lands on the bottom somewhere (That just means I've experienced tons of kick-ass Choucroute Garnie in my life). END
BEGIN NOW    Beer:Yeast and Hops Flights - All good. END
BEGIN NOW      This place has a great selection of beers and if they curate it as they described, extra kudos. END
BEGIN NOW    Lowdown:I'll probably go back for the beer and the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW      The food and area, not so much. END
BEGIN NOW      I would be here often if I lived in the neighborhood, that's how much I liked my experience. END
BEGIN NOW      Some people will say that the food is over-priced, I can see that argument. END
BEGIN NOW    Recommendation:MAKE A RESERVATION. END
BEGIN NOW    Love the ambience annnnd it's in my 'hood. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm going in a hike tomorrow so I wanted something hefty even though I am currently sans meat. END
BEGIN NOW     So I ordered the Gem &amp; Jewels salad along with the Soft Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     Sooooooo good. END
BEGIN NOW     Omg, this salad. END
BEGIN NOW     For reals. END
BEGIN NOW     Not playing. END
BEGIN NOW     The softness of gem lettuce, the sweetness of the persimmon, the tang of the pomegranate cut with the slight acidic tang of the crème fraiche dressing. END
BEGIN NOW     but y'all don't hear me though. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm sure many have waxed poetic about the pretzel so I'll just say, order it. END
BEGIN NOW     Their beer menu is extensive and the staff is very welcoming. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered one of the sausage combos and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausage was made and cooked perfectly, and the fixings, while not terribly appetizing to look at, were perfect along with the bun. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is great and I can always find something new to try. END
BEGIN NOW     Despite being busy, service was quick on everything and the manager was also helping out and very responsive. END
BEGIN NOW    I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Their detail to their house made food,  fine local beers and wine is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     The corn dog is the best you'll ever have. END
BEGIN NOW     It gets busy and some might say somewhat pricey, but well worth all of it! I've been here several times since they've opened and am always impressed. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank goodness for fine food in Oakland!PS- they just started doing take-out; I cannot wait to eat a corn dog in bed. END
BEGIN NOW     Yum. END
BEGIN NOW    This is a cool hipster place - love the vibe here. END
BEGIN NOW      If you like beer, it is a must. END
BEGIN NOW      I am not a drinker but friends enjoyed it here. END
BEGIN NOW      The hostess was very friendly to the wait staff. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a place to share food and chat with friends. END
BEGIN NOW      It does get kinda loud in here and you need to raise your voice to talk at times. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is good. END
BEGIN NOW    we shared 2 sampler appetizer plate and an entree. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a good taste of all kinds of pork. END
BEGIN NOW      The portions were good. END
BEGIN NOW    not too small and too overly large. END
BEGIN NOW    good size. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices are decent. END
BEGIN NOW      It is nice to have a gastropub in temescal area. END
BEGIN NOW      With home run down the block and blue bottle opening near by, I am glad this neighborhood is up and coming with great eats. END
BEGIN NOW    This is an awesome place for beer lovers - they just have an amazing selection of local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     They also have a selection of ciders, which I tend to order. END
BEGIN NOW     Usually you can grab a seat at the communal tables, but you can also make reservations if you have a bigger party. END
BEGIN NOW     I've found the food to be a little disappointing, with very few options for vegetarians be warned!. END
BEGIN NOW    If you are driving to the neighborhood, do NOT leave anything in your car. END
BEGIN NOW     No bags, no cell phone chargers. END
BEGIN NOW      Your car WILL be broken into, and you will not get your stuff back. END
BEGIN NOW    Okay, I swear, it took me a while to choose between 3 or 4 stars - I've seriously been going back and forth for about 5 minutes now! We ordered the mixed grill - I believe it was a mix of 3 different meats (a piece of sausage, pork belly/thickest bacon slab I ever seeeen) and a half of a small tiny bird (I think Cornish game hen??). END
BEGIN NOW    anyways! 'twas delicious and utterly satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW     Full of flavor and goes so gooood with the beer!OH YEAH. END
BEGIN NOW    the beer. END
BEGIN NOW     that's a whole separate story guys. END
BEGIN NOW     this place has a FAT list of brewery-direct beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     they are hand-selected and have a variety from all over the west coast. END
BEGIN NOW     In addition, they're pretty knowledgeable on the beers they offer, so when in doubt, just ask for a suggestion. END
BEGIN NOW     Now. END
BEGIN NOW    the reason I gave 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    the pricing. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean. END
BEGIN NOW    really, for a small ramekin of basically what we Americans know as "Corn Nuts" you're gonna charge $3 for less than a handful? AND. END
BEGIN NOW    they're way too hard to chew, they might be better off sticking in a sling-shot and letting a kid have some fun. END
BEGIN NOW     $6 for a regular pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW     The plate we got, Mixed Grill. END
BEGIN NOW    small tiny portions. END
BEGIN NOW    was wrong for 2 of us to share, but THAT small plate was $28 :/  yikes. END
BEGIN NOW    Another reason for not giving 4 stars was the attitude of the staff - mostly the hostess, the guys at the tap, and our specific server. END
BEGIN NOW    so I guess that's the majority. END
BEGIN NOW     they had this attitude that came off as if they were "too cool" or "too hipster" to help out and serve normal people coming from work that just want a good bite and beer. END
BEGIN NOW     definitely felt like they're only welcoming to a certain and specific type of crowd. END
BEGIN NOW    guess you need tats, an old leather jacket and a septum piercing to get the thumbs up for them. END
BEGIN NOW     it's a shame, because I would've gone back for their food and beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW    probably on a pay day since its kinda pricey , HAH!. END
BEGIN NOW    Went by again for an early dinner on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW     No wait right at 5pm, but it seemed to get crowded around 5:45pm. END
BEGIN NOW    This time we had a chance to sample more of the menu and I have to say that I was actually really surprised at how good the food was! I was prepared to support this place based on the fact that it serves good beer and is within walking distance of where I live, but now I can legit say it is worth seeking out. END
BEGIN NOW    We had:- charcuterie sampler of pork rillettes, liver mousse, trotter terrine ($13 for the sampler of three). END
BEGIN NOW     Quality: B+, Adesso is way better. END
BEGIN NOW     Quantity: B, too much of the sides, not quite enough of the main bits, but for $13, it was alright- frisee and arugula salad with grilled peaches and humboldt fog toast ($8 I think?). END
BEGIN NOW     Quality: A+, this was perfectly balanced and well-seasoned and the peaches were ripe and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     Quantity: B, the toast was kinda ridiculously thinly spread with cheese- rabbit &amp; pork belly salad with onion stuff and herb stuff on it, it came with chips and pickles ($14). END
BEGIN NOW     Quality: A+++++ the sausage was incredible. END
BEGIN NOW     I was really blown away by how good it was. END
BEGIN NOW     Served on a nice soft roll that seemed a bit pretzel-like. END
BEGIN NOW     I've eaten at Rosamunde countless times and I have to say, this sausage blows theirs out of the park. END
BEGIN NOW     Seems like maybe they've addressed the "okra slime" issue for the pickled veggie side because I saw no okra and no slime. END
BEGIN NOW     Quantity: B+ the sausage was decently sized but still for the price. END
BEGIN NOW     B+- side of cheddar grits ($6) Quality: A+ hi I love butter cream and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW     yummmmmm Quantity: B. END
BEGIN NOW     come on. END
BEGIN NOW     it's grits. END
BEGIN NOW     you could give us more than 1. END
BEGIN NOW    25 cups for $6. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here three times. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved it the first two, really disliked it the last. END
BEGIN NOW      They've changed the menu: they used to have a great salad ("visions of spring") which still shows up on their online menu but was no longer on offer last Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW      The salad I had (which was basically the only option) called the "green machine" was a salty, gloppy mess. END
BEGIN NOW      And worst of all, they "ran out" of the soft pretzels, which was 90 percent of our reason for being there. END
BEGIN NOW     At 8 p. END
BEGIN NOW    m. END
BEGIN NOW     on a Saturday night - really??? Our less than helpful server offered us nothing as substitute (some of the potato chips that came with the dinner the people next to us had would have been good to satisfy the salty craving, but we didn't know about them). END
BEGIN NOW      And our platter of three different salumi only had two. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess they "ran out" of the third variety. END
BEGIN NOW      Finally, our "medium rare" ribeye was raw: presumably they "ran out" of time to cook it properly. END
BEGIN NOW    We love Hog's Apothecary- relaxed local vibe- great beer and cider selection - I LOVE the Graviva personally - their albeit more limited wine selection works even with their focus on draft and craft beer- food is sophisticated, interesting and the menu is always changing- service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable - they now have added brunch which is awesome :)- to date we have always been able to walk in and get seated - we make reservations about 50% of the time as it can get busy for dinner even early in the dining hour. END
BEGIN NOW    The beer selection is great and fairly priced but the food selection is not. END
BEGIN NOW     Well developed flavor with tragically pretentious ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     It is exactly what you should expect from a hipster joint in piedmont, $23 for a pork chop. END
BEGIN NOW     The meatballs were the best thing on the table. END
BEGIN NOW     Bring your horn rimmed glasses. END
BEGIN NOW    Great beer. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff is very knowledgeable and all I need to tell them is a type of beer I like and they find the perfect match for me. END
BEGIN NOW      Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I have not tried the food yet. END
BEGIN NOW    I tried Hog's Apothecary for the second time. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is very good but the service just horrible. END
BEGIN NOW      I arrive famished on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW      Ordered the Clubber. END
BEGIN NOW      Food arrived about 30 minutes later and the waitress once again quickly disappeared after dropping off the food. END
BEGIN NOW       No apology or acknowledgment on the long time to deliver the food. END
BEGIN NOW      No, "Can I get you anything else?"  No follow up with, "Is everything ok?"   Poof - gone. END
BEGIN NOW      She delivered the wrong sandwich to me, though my partner's was correct. END
BEGIN NOW      Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW      It's such a shame since the food and beer is pretty good here, but not good enough to overshadow the down right poor, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW      Sorry, not going back. END
BEGIN NOW    When going to the restaurant of a friend for the first time, one prepares themselves to be polite, offering words of praise out of the sense of duty that comes with being friends. END
BEGIN NOW      We caution ourselves not to be harsh or critical and generally keep any negatives quiet. END
BEGIN NOW      After all, they are our friends and we'd expect the same. END
BEGIN NOW    Thank goodness I don't have to keep the negatives to myself. END
BEGIN NOW      as I couldn't find any. END
BEGIN NOW      In fact, to say I was impressed would be an understatement. END
BEGIN NOW    Brad and John have taken what once was a dilapidated laundromat with a seedy past and created a neighborhood gathering spot that is open, airy and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      I was at first slightly put off by the long tables and benches, as I generally prefer not to share my table with people I don't know, but I came to realize that it promotes conversation between strangers and contributes to the neighborhood feel. END
BEGIN NOW      While the dining area is not huge, the high ceiling with exposed beams and open air skylight make it feel much larger. END
BEGIN NOW      "Hog's" boasts more taps than I could get through in a week. END
BEGIN NOW      They have beers on tap to appeal to any beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW      They also cycle beers in and out to keep the selections new and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      Now. END
BEGIN NOW     on to the food itself. END
BEGIN NOW      We started out with the warm pretzel for two with cheese sauce and mustard. END
BEGIN NOW     ( One thing you must know before I go further. END
BEGIN NOW      Nearly everything you eat is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW      The mustard, the cheese, the sausage, the kraut. END
BEGIN NOW      the exceptions being the buns and, if memory serves, the pretzel itself. END
BEGIN NOW     )  The pretzel was hot and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      The house made mustard and cheese sauce were the perfect compliment. END
BEGIN NOW      There's just no comparison between jar mustard and mustard made fresh that day. END
BEGIN NOW      For my entree I ordered the schnitzel. END
BEGIN NOW      It's really easy to overcook pork and make it dry. END
BEGIN NOW      Not the case here. END
BEGIN NOW      The breading was light, the pork juicy and while I used my knife at first, I ended up using just my fork as it was so tender. END
BEGIN NOW      The arugula and warm potato salad only served to enhance the succulent pork. END
BEGIN NOW      My dining companions ordered the 'Basa' with kraut and the Devil Bird fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      I was raised by a German mother who made ( and at 70 still makes ) her own kraut. END
BEGIN NOW     As much as I cannot believe I am saying this, ( Sorry, Mom ) the kraut at Hog's is better. END
BEGIN NOW      especially thrown on top of a juicy and savory sausage with just the right pop from the casing. END
BEGIN NOW      ( Sorry, Mom ) The chicken was juicy and full of flavor, but it's the breading that really takes it over the top. END
BEGIN NOW      It's hard to describe, but there's a slight sweetness to it that, to me, was reminiscent of that first bite of a churro or a Krispy Kreme that immediately makes you want another bite. END
BEGIN NOW      It's difficult NOT to want to clean your plate. END
BEGIN NOW    I do have one regret. END
BEGIN NOW      Only one. END
BEGIN NOW      I didn't try dessert. END
BEGIN NOW      We all surveyed the dessert menu, but after a great beer and amazing food there was just no room. END
BEGIN NOW    I know I am a friend and friends tend to be biased so I encourage you to read other reviews. END
BEGIN NOW      Aside from the small contingent of nay-sayers you will find that the overall rating of 4/5 stars is well earned and well deserved. END
BEGIN NOW      It's worth checking out. END
BEGIN NOW    A little spendy for what you get, but everything we had was great and the atmosphere and service was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW    We've visited Hog's a few times now. END
BEGIN NOW      Every single time, we've received amazing food and exceptional service. END
BEGIN NOW      We've left with happy bellies and smiles on our faces. END
BEGIN NOW    The food was great, as were the beers. END
BEGIN NOW      Unfortunately, the service was slow. END
BEGIN NOW      Our server was new, and not super attentive or knowledgeable about the menu. END
BEGIN NOW      Hopefully she'll hit her stride. END
BEGIN NOW    I guess my main issue with this place is that it is not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW      They bill themselves as an "American Beer Hall", which to me means:- A large craft beer selection (check)- A good, informal place to gather with friends (nope-though the potential is there)- Maybe some inexpensive pub style food. END
BEGIN NOW      However, when you walk inside, you are greeted by a hostess and added to the list for a seat at one of their community tables or bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is VERY EXPENSIVE for what it is, and the staff projects a major restaurant vibe, but the atmosphere is that of a bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm really not sure what is going on here but its not at all what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW    For about a year I anticipated their opening and ended up there on the first night they were open to the public. END
BEGIN NOW      I've been back a few times, and it only seems to have become more restaurant-y. END
BEGIN NOW      One positive thing to say, the beer selection is excellent and the price is right for draft beers. END
BEGIN NOW      That said, It's not easy to get in for just a few beers (especially for more than 1-3 people), so I have ended up passing it up when going out with friends even though I live 3 blocks away. END
BEGIN NOW    I really hope that Hog's will make up its mind, are you an up-scale restaurant or are you a beer hall? Right now you are somewhere in-between and it just isn't working for my demographic at all. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're looking for a spot with tons of (mostly) local beers on tap, this is a great spot to visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Death and Taxes is my favorite beer they have. END
BEGIN NOW     They also have a small selection of wines if beer isn't your thing. END
BEGIN NOW     The Grilled Greens starter I had there was meh. END
BEGIN NOW     It was way too salty for me. END
BEGIN NOW     I wouldn't recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW     However, I heard the corn dog is amazing, i will have to try it next time I'm there. END
BEGIN NOW     The Devilbird (fried chicken on top of some spicy garbanzo beans with chili oil) OMG. END
BEGIN NOW     So delicious and perfectly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW     So buttermilky and crispy! I love the fried chicken there. END
BEGIN NOW     It never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is great there, I've never had any issues with the staff whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW     They're always nice and prompt! Also: be prepared to get a little cozy with other patrons, the seating is picnic table style. END
BEGIN NOW    Great beer selection, corn dog and hot dog were ok but made in house. END
BEGIN NOW     pate, rillette were on point. END
BEGIN NOW     would def come back for some beer and pate. END
BEGIN NOW    Kinda shocking to read reviews about how snobby the wait staff was, I found the service to be very friendly and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW     As for the food and beer - YUM. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was so flavorful, with fresh herbs and the sauce on the pork chops was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved it so much, we asked the waitress if we could have some bread so we could sop up every ounce, because yes, we are hogs. END
BEGIN NOW     The kitchen specially prepared some toast for us so we could lick the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection was good, the menu described the brews well and I was pleased with my selection. END
BEGIN NOW     The interior is pretty cool, but can get loud. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking forward to returning. END
BEGIN NOW    If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! There food and beer is fantastic! They have an industrial feel to them and sure its a hipster joint but that doesn't detract from the delicious food and beer!Recommendations: 1. END
BEGIN NOW     Butchers coffer. END
BEGIN NOW     Get all three, every time. END
BEGIN NOW     Its worth it2. END
BEGIN NOW     Lil Salty3. END
BEGIN NOW     Any of their sausagesBeer: 1. END
BEGIN NOW     The Butcher 2. END
BEGIN NOW     Tunnel VisionGreat Job guys. END
BEGIN NOW    Only tried the beers here so I can't comment on food. END
BEGIN NOW     There was a great variety of drinks and the bartender was so nice to let me try several until I found a beer I was satisfied with. END
BEGIN NOW     Sucks that its so hard to find a seat here, it seems like they could better maximize their space. END
BEGIN NOW     Also the lighting in here was so dark. END
BEGIN NOW     But overall, another trendy restaurant to hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm a little biased since it's right up my street, but Hog's is a pretty special place. END
BEGIN NOW     The rotating taps, solid food, and ambiance are great. END
BEGIN NOW     Tried their brunch for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. END
BEGIN NOW     Had the pork belly/beef burger and apothecary benedict at our table and both were very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW     They also were open to showing the football game our group wanted to watch. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, a solid four stars, and my go-to neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Much, much better reason to come to 40th Street than Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW    Hot damn. END
BEGIN NOW      We came here for their soft opening, and we've been coming here regularly ever since. END
BEGIN NOW      The food: fantastic, inventive, and there's always something new. END
BEGIN NOW      It tends to be heavy fare (even the vegetable sides and salads, which will frequently have an egg or lardons), but it's always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      We've tried things from every section of their menu and have never been disappointed (well, I didn't like their collards, but I'm from Kentucky. END
BEGIN NOW      The kale, on the other hand, is always amazing). END
BEGIN NOW    The beer: excellent selection of mostly local breweries. END
BEGIN NOW      They generally have good prices ($5-$6, though watch out for the expensive Rare Barrel offerings), as well as a nice balance of beer styles, ranging from pilsners to Belgian Quadrupels, and thankfully not too many IPAs. END
BEGIN NOW    The service: we've had one or two servers who weren't on the ball, but the regular staff is fabulous, friendly, and knowledgeable about their beers. END
BEGIN NOW      I love that the owners are typically around, pitching in. END
BEGIN NOW      They're really friendly if you get the chance to talk to them. END
BEGIN NOW    The cons?  It can get loud at times, but that shouldn't be an issue if you go earlier in the evening. END
BEGIN NOW      But that's a pretty minor drawback when everything else is so good. END
BEGIN NOW    Just. END
BEGIN NOW     meh. END
BEGIN NOW     Pros: Big beer selectionInteresting menuCool vibeDecent foodCons:HORRIBLE service (waited 2 hours)Overpriced for what you getLoudI wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW     It definitely wasn't worth the $90+ dollars my husband I spent on a few drinks, an appetizer, and one entree. END
BEGIN NOW    I LOVE the food and the beer list at Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW     The service has always been good to above average in terms of speed, attentiveness and product knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW     The house made sausages are great, the schnitzel great, the fried chicken so plump and juicy. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer list has many styles from many great big and small California craft breweries. END
BEGIN NOW     I would say there beer list rivals any beer hall in Oakland including the Good Hop, Beer Rev and Cato's. END
BEGIN NOW     HOWEVER, they were spendy, $14 for a bratwurst, when I first started going there 1 year ago and now they are $17. END
BEGIN NOW     They are served with  some homemade chips and a small pile of pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW     Hog's like everything else in "up and coming" Oakland is darned expensive for modest portions. END
BEGIN NOW     Beers have gone up $2/pint as well. END
BEGIN NOW      I get they have high rent, need to pay employees a living wage and nothing is getting cheaper but my sense is these trendy dining houses are going for it because their clientele will pay whatever they try to charge at a cool place. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll miss you, Hogs, but $17 bucks for a fancy hot dog and $7. END
BEGIN NOW    50 for a pint of IPA isn't a good value. END
BEGIN NOW     4 stars for beer and food, 4 stars for service and atmosphere, 2 stars for value. END
BEGIN NOW     Average 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW    Hip neighborhood joint, with the usual trendy, expensive spin. END
BEGIN NOW     I did enjoy the food, (yum!), and the beer, (good beer menu selection). END
BEGIN NOW     I'd give the place 4 stars, but the value is lacking. END
BEGIN NOW     $23. END
BEGIN NOW    47 for a beer ($5. END
BEGIN NOW    50), a side of bacon ($6?!) and a Brussel Sprout salad with bacon bits &amp; one egg ($10?!). END
BEGIN NOW     It's too expensive to make it a regular stop. END
BEGIN NOW    My friends and I had a good time. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd go back. END
BEGIN NOW    Awesome if you like beer, which we do. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, beer + meat = amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Get the meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice atmosphere, a beer hall, kinda romantical, actually. END
BEGIN NOW     Bummer? The service. END
BEGIN NOW     Awkward, lackluster. END
BEGIN NOW      Although the server didn't really eat meat, they also didn't seem interested in the food or beer. END
BEGIN NOW     No recommendations or knowledge about either. END
BEGIN NOW     Which is fine - I believe I was far more excited, and we can both ride that wave. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, the hostess was strange. END
BEGIN NOW     If I worked there I'd own it  - its easy to make service industry customers who came to get drunk and spend money happy. END
BEGIN NOW      At least at my job it is. END
BEGIN NOW     This place has so much potential - can you imagine if the service was at the very least  - engaging? It has a casual vibe, but once you see the prices you'll be looking for some engagement, I promise you. END
BEGIN NOW     Some other random cute staff would come by and be nice and fill water and I was grateful. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer float is small, but very good. END
BEGIN NOW    super excited about this addition to the 40th/broadway area. END
BEGIN NOW     the service, the foods, the beer selection(!), the ambiance, the space, everything gets an A+!we got sat along the bar that is built around the perimeter of the pub, facing out onto 40th, and we had no complaints. END
BEGIN NOW     our server was so on top of it, it actually took me by surprise. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm just not used to someone checking in every 10 minutes, but this is what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW     we were not of want of anything. END
BEGIN NOW     from water to new beers, she was there to make sure we had what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW     and the place was packed. END
BEGIN NOW     other highlights - the house made pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW     GET ONE. END
BEGIN NOW     the music was perfect, not too loud, but just loud enough that I picked up on one of my fave bands of all time - pavement, then some sonic youth, plus some other 90's-ish indie rock that I was definitely digging. END
BEGIN NOW     parking as others have mentioned is a breeze. END
BEGIN NOW     and it's also just a block or two down from the local record shop (1,2,3,4 go records), the cool mens shop - Pine &amp; Elder, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     so you can get your shop on beforehand if you so choose. END
BEGIN NOW     finally, I just need to add that I was more than just a little excited about their beer offerings. END
BEGIN NOW     and I'm not even a huge beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW     the two that I tried - a dark chocolatey number  (coffee &amp; cigarettes by CellarMaker) and a local herbal beer that came recommended (a style I never even knew existed but one that I'm kinda dying to sample again!) completely blew me away. END
BEGIN NOW     this is the stuff I expect from a beer institution like Trappist but not from the new neighborhood pub. END
BEGIN NOW     yet, hog's is the spot I have a hankering to return to. END
BEGIN NOW     asap. END
BEGIN NOW     stop by before there's a line out the door. END
BEGIN NOW     it's only a matter of time!. END
BEGIN NOW    It was really tasty! I was very impressed with the beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW     If I wasn't the one that drove I swear I would have tried at least 5 on the list. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend and I split two of the sausage sandwiches and both were very good. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere is very hipster. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a shuffleboard in the back. END
BEGIN NOW     The seating is bench style where you'll be seated at a long table, possibly next to really obnoxious people that you have to just try to ignore and talk over and try not to look at and throw death stares over. END
BEGIN NOW     (If I had that 5th beer I'm sure I would have become best friends with them. END
BEGIN NOW    ). END
BEGIN NOW    We feel happy to report we live only ten minutes away and can return repeatedly with no effort. END
BEGIN NOW     A creative menu with fabulous execution, we have enjoyed everything we have ordered. END
BEGIN NOW      The salads and starters are great. END
BEGIN NOW     We loved their version of a Caesar salad. END
BEGIN NOW     The sausages are fabulous with homemade chips and slaw, yummy. END
BEGIN NOW     Their skirt steak and pork chops are incredible. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's not forget a large on tap beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW       Marvelous find. END
BEGIN NOW    First met Tim as he was sourcing his ingredients from local farmers markets, a year ago. END
BEGIN NOW      I still see him there today. END
BEGIN NOW         Tonight was my first night to visit and eat, and I was not disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried two starters, a salad and two of the sausage sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW      I could go on and on to say how the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sausages burst with complex but not overwhelming flavors, and lard fried chips were crisp and light. END
BEGIN NOW       But I won't, and just say that they have a large array of detailed local beers, and they craft their food with thought, care and precision from farm to fork. END
BEGIN NOW        Yum!. END
BEGIN NOW     Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW      Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW      Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW      And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW      But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW      And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW      I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW      After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW      Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW      I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW     There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW      With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW      Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW     If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW      The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW     As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW      Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW      Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW     On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW      I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW      They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW      :(. END
BEGIN NOW     I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW      The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW       There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW      But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW      Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW      If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW     Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW     JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW      He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW     The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW      from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW      Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW     Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW      No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW      Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW       The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW     What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW      Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW      The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW      We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW      If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW      Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW       Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW      I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW      I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW      I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW      The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW      You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW     I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW      Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW      They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW      The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW      Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW      Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW     This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW      BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW      His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW      I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW      Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW      Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW      I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW      I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW      Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW      I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW       Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW      Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW     Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW      Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW     I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW       Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW      The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW      Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW     So. END
BEGIN NOW      much. END
BEGIN NOW      whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW      They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW      They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW     It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW      Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW      It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW      What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW      More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW      The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW      I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW      Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW     This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW       Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW       Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW     00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW       NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW     This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW     And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW     Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW     The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW     Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW     Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW     This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW      It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW      The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW      Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW     a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW      space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW      you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW     on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW     Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW      Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW      For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW      But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW      And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW      The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW      Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW      Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW      The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW      I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW      Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW      Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW      Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW      Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW      They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW      Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW      Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW     The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW      I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW      I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW      There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW      I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW      I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW     Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW      Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW       The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW       Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW     The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW     I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW       Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW       These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW     Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW       If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW       The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW       Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW       Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW       This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW       You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW       Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW       Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW       Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW     Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW     PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW       Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW     I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW     Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW      My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW     Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW     My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW       We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW     The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW       That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW       Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW       Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW     However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW       Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW      i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW     "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW       So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW     But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW       Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW     One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW       She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW       Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW       Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW     To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW       There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW       But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW      They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW      However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW     To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW       And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW       And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW       Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW     They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW      In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW      All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW      Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW      Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW      Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW     This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW      Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW      The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW      You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW      If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW      The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW      Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW      He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW      We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW      He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW      "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW      I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW      The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW      All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW      Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW      Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW     At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW      What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW      Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW      Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW      What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW     Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW       And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW     My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW     " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW      what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW        Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW       On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW      something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW       My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW       Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW       "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW     ". END
BEGIN NOW     Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW     From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW     Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW      It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW     Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW      Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW     Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW      Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW      Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW       I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW     I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW       We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW       Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW       Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW       Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW     This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW      Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW      Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW      Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW     And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW      But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW      If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW     Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW     Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW     The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW      I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW      Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW      As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW      This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW      We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW     but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW      I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW      Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW      Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW     This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW      There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW      The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW      The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW      All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW      The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW      I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW      Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW      They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW      My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW      A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW     Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW      While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW      While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW      Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW       They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW      The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW       The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW      They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW     P. END
BEGIN NOW     S. END
BEGIN NOW      I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW     Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW     great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW     I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW      I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW      So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW      Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW      I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW      I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW      It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW      We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW       They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW       They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW      Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW     Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW       No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW       Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW       I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW     Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW      The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW      This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW      Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW       From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW       The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW       They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW       By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW       Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW       Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW      My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW      Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW      The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW      5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW     Really cool atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      I absolutely LOVED the music selection. END
BEGIN NOW      Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted). END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks were great, well priced. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly bar staff. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd recommend to friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely a dive. END
BEGIN NOW      Terrible DJ. END
BEGIN NOW      And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music. END
BEGIN NOW     I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able. END
BEGIN NOW      But on the upside, it's easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW      And there's a lot of seating, which I loved. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery. END
BEGIN NOW      I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW      After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW      Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over. END
BEGIN NOW      I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order. END
BEGIN NOW     There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area. END
BEGIN NOW      With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night. END
BEGIN NOW      Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip). END
BEGIN NOW     If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch. END
BEGIN NOW      The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover. END
BEGIN NOW     As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, hello white people of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops. END
BEGIN NOW      Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious. END
BEGIN NOW      Thank you, we hardly noticed. END
BEGIN NOW     On the intro act, the power went out 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW      I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train. END
BEGIN NOW      They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first. END
BEGIN NOW      :(. END
BEGIN NOW     I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time. END
BEGIN NOW      The bouncer was funny and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're in the area, go and have fun!. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar. END
BEGIN NOW       There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event. END
BEGIN NOW      But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself. END
BEGIN NOW      Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW      If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW     Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes. END
BEGIN NOW     JOHNNY is the man. END
BEGIN NOW      He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste. END
BEGIN NOW     The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing . END
BEGIN NOW      from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people. END
BEGIN NOW      Laid back grungy hipster vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      Music was loud and I felt at home. END
BEGIN NOW     Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night. END
BEGIN NOW      No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW      Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started. END
BEGIN NOW     It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party. END
BEGIN NOW       The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool ass people in there!. END
BEGIN NOW     What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5. END
BEGIN NOW      Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude. END
BEGIN NOW      The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back. END
BEGIN NOW      We were singing along and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW      If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW      Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place. END
BEGIN NOW       Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is the worlds best bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW      I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me. END
BEGIN NOW      I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way. END
BEGIN NOW      I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying. END
BEGIN NOW      The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW      You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light. END
BEGIN NOW     I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW      Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing. END
BEGIN NOW      They always have a DJ on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW      The photo booth is all kinds of fun. END
BEGIN NOW      Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      The bar area and staff is nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Prices aren't too bad for JLS. END
BEGIN NOW      Looking forward to being back soon. END
BEGIN NOW     This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor. END
BEGIN NOW      BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft. END
BEGIN NOW      His words exactly, "My bar, my money". END
BEGIN NOW      I had good reason to file a report with the BBB. END
BEGIN NOW      Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey. END
BEGIN NOW      Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server. END
BEGIN NOW      I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles. END
BEGIN NOW      I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology. END
BEGIN NOW      Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW      I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city. END
BEGIN NOW       Many of us like it just the way it is. END
BEGIN NOW      Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars. END
BEGIN NOW     Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl. END
BEGIN NOW      Fun times. END
BEGIN NOW     I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW       Reviews do not lie. END
BEGIN NOW      The place is casual, relaxed, friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone there seemed to be having a good time. END
BEGIN NOW      Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local. END
BEGIN NOW     So. END
BEGIN NOW      much. END
BEGIN NOW      whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW      They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches. END
BEGIN NOW      They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face. END
BEGIN NOW     It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking. END
BEGIN NOW      Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby. END
BEGIN NOW      It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks'). END
BEGIN NOW      What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time. END
BEGIN NOW      More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos). END
BEGIN NOW      The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents. END
BEGIN NOW      I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part. END
BEGIN NOW      Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise). END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, a-ok :). END
BEGIN NOW     This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service. END
BEGIN NOW       Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good. END
BEGIN NOW       Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5. END
BEGIN NOW     00 is totally worth it. END
BEGIN NOW       NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none. END
BEGIN NOW     This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW     And the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW     Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Having another one. END
BEGIN NOW     The fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW     Or when you are hanging out at Fest. END
BEGIN NOW     Drinking with your friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end. END
BEGIN NOW     Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends. END
BEGIN NOW     This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening. END
BEGIN NOW      It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present. END
BEGIN NOW      The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company. END
BEGIN NOW      Love you guys, keep rocking it. END
BEGIN NOW     The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods. END
BEGIN NOW     a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music. END
BEGIN NOW      space isn't that big. END
BEGIN NOW      you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink. END
BEGIN NOW     on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back. END
BEGIN NOW     Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things. END
BEGIN NOW      Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger. END
BEGIN NOW      For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did. END
BEGIN NOW      But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night. END
BEGIN NOW      And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW      The Night Light is brand new. END
BEGIN NOW      Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior is cush and luxurious. END
BEGIN NOW      Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355. END
BEGIN NOW      The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging. END
BEGIN NOW      I enjoyed the sound they had going. END
BEGIN NOW      Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried and loved the Wild and Free. END
BEGIN NOW      Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye. END
BEGIN NOW      Both were 8 bucks each. END
BEGIN NOW      Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap. END
BEGIN NOW      They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out. END
BEGIN NOW      Night light, I hope you are here to stay. END
BEGIN NOW      Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :). END
BEGIN NOW     The owner doug really cares about this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area. END
BEGIN NOW      I was very surprised that this was here. END
BEGIN NOW      I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor makes this spot feel trendy. END
BEGIN NOW      There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor. END
BEGIN NOW      I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy. END
BEGIN NOW      I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a great spot. END
BEGIN NOW     Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW      Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great. END
BEGIN NOW       The happy hour prices are awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW       Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop. END
BEGIN NOW     The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened. END
BEGIN NOW     I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service. END
BEGIN NOW       Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW       These guys deserve a crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site. END
BEGIN NOW     Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster. END
BEGIN NOW       If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least. END
BEGIN NOW       The venue is really small, but breathes character. END
BEGIN NOW       Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer. END
BEGIN NOW       Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par. END
BEGIN NOW       This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around. END
BEGIN NOW       You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here. END
BEGIN NOW       Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing. END
BEGIN NOW       Awesome place to catch up with old friends. END
BEGIN NOW       Drinks are definitely stiff. END
BEGIN NOW     Wait staff is not pretentious at all. END
BEGIN NOW     PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned. END
BEGIN NOW       Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music. END
BEGIN NOW     I haven't gone to any shows yet. END
BEGIN NOW     Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight). END
BEGIN NOW      My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW     Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye. END
BEGIN NOW     My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night. END
BEGIN NOW       We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up. END
BEGIN NOW     The doorman was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper. END
BEGIN NOW       That's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW       Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like. END
BEGIN NOW       Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often. END
BEGIN NOW     However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here. END
BEGIN NOW       Hence, the 2 stars - "meh. END
BEGIN NOW      i've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW     "The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc). END
BEGIN NOW       So that was fine. END
BEGIN NOW     But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay. END
BEGIN NOW       Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced. END
BEGIN NOW     One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him. END
BEGIN NOW       She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner). END
BEGIN NOW       Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW       Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them. END
BEGIN NOW     To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW       There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around. END
BEGIN NOW       But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening. END
BEGIN NOW      They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out. END
BEGIN NOW      However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back. END
BEGIN NOW     To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW       And it wasn't a special occasion. END
BEGIN NOW       And there were a lot of people in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet. END
BEGIN NOW       Let's hope they get it together. END
BEGIN NOW     They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk. END
BEGIN NOW      In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW      All of this on their second night. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW      Always good tunes spinning. END
BEGIN NOW      Really good happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW      Great for after work. END
BEGIN NOW     This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come. END
BEGIN NOW      Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize. END
BEGIN NOW      The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen. END
BEGIN NOW      You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW      If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff. END
BEGIN NOW      The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW      Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever. END
BEGIN NOW      He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us. END
BEGIN NOW      We shared stories and hung out. END
BEGIN NOW      He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went . END
BEGIN NOW      "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW      I own the Nightlight". END
BEGIN NOW      The rest is history. END
BEGIN NOW      All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight. END
BEGIN NOW      Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face. END
BEGIN NOW      Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people. END
BEGIN NOW     At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW      What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate. END
BEGIN NOW      Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW      Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls. END
BEGIN NOW      What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat. END
BEGIN NOW     Fantastic cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW     Friendly and knowledgeable staff. END
BEGIN NOW       And I love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW     I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue. END
BEGIN NOW     My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times. END
BEGIN NOW     " All in all, a really fun, adorable bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Went here recently for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW      what can I say? I'm a fan. END
BEGIN NOW        Love the decor. END
BEGIN NOW       On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW      something I appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW       My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work. END
BEGIN NOW       Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages. END
BEGIN NOW       "I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW     ". END
BEGIN NOW     Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night. END
BEGIN NOW     From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe. END
BEGIN NOW     With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time. END
BEGIN NOW     Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville. END
BEGIN NOW      It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele. END
BEGIN NOW     Works out great for us Oaklanders. END
BEGIN NOW      Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop. END
BEGIN NOW     Freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows. END
BEGIN NOW      Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams. END
BEGIN NOW      Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW       I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW     I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences. END
BEGIN NOW       We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing. END
BEGIN NOW       Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW       Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW       Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times. END
BEGIN NOW     This is really the only reason I go out after dark. END
BEGIN NOW      Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people. END
BEGIN NOW      Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here. END
BEGIN NOW      Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance). END
BEGIN NOW     And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately. END
BEGIN NOW      But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies. END
BEGIN NOW      If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home. END
BEGIN NOW     Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW     Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS. END
BEGIN NOW     Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW     The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink. END
BEGIN NOW      I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel. END
BEGIN NOW      Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink. END
BEGIN NOW      As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table. END
BEGIN NOW      This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room. END
BEGIN NOW      We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music. END
BEGIN NOW     but that may be part of it's eclectic charm. END
BEGIN NOW      I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW      Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok. END
BEGIN NOW      Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW     but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better. END
BEGIN NOW     This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror. END
BEGIN NOW      There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you. END
BEGIN NOW      The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW      The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space. END
BEGIN NOW      All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space. END
BEGIN NOW     Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area. END
BEGIN NOW      The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second. END
BEGIN NOW      I also had a decent Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW      Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber. END
BEGIN NOW      They also had some beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was very good. END
BEGIN NOW      My bartender was attentive and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW      A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW     Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field. END
BEGIN NOW      While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW      While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW      Four Stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar. END
BEGIN NOW       They now accept all major credit cards. END
BEGIN NOW      The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics. END
BEGIN NOW       The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu. END
BEGIN NOW      They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon. END
BEGIN NOW     P. END
BEGIN NOW     S. END
BEGIN NOW      I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!. END
BEGIN NOW     Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good. END
BEGIN NOW     great drinks, awesome atmosphere!. END
BEGIN NOW     I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar. END
BEGIN NOW      I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open. END
BEGIN NOW      So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a. END
BEGIN NOW      Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did. END
BEGIN NOW      I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place. END
BEGIN NOW      I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW      It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth. END
BEGIN NOW      We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners. END
BEGIN NOW       They were super cool and the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW       They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit. END
BEGIN NOW      Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW     Went on opening night and was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW       No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd. END
BEGIN NOW       Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed. END
BEGIN NOW       I'll definitely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW     Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor. END
BEGIN NOW      The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff. END
BEGIN NOW      This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time. END
BEGIN NOW      Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces. END
BEGIN NOW       From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style. END
BEGIN NOW       The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun. END
BEGIN NOW       They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?). END
BEGIN NOW       By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years. END
BEGIN NOW       Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again. END
BEGIN NOW       Can't wait to go back !. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night. END
BEGIN NOW      My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT. END
BEGIN NOW      Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW      The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes. END
BEGIN NOW      5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW     Great dive bar with outdoor seating area - which is not a common thing in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW      Simple, straightforward drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      As with all dive bars, the bathrooms are not that clean, but you know, deal with it. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, there was a not-totally-stable seeming lady who was yelling at women in the restroom to get out of the toilet faster. END
BEGIN NOW      The outdoor seating area is really nice with some full trees for shade during the afternoons. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, they seem cool with letting you bring in outside food and there is a cuban place, pizza place and burger place adjacent to the H&amp;D Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     I would give this place zero stars and the Abusive Bartender badge if I could, after witnessing some rather horrific and disturbing behavior from a male bartender on a female customer that was 100% unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW       Been going here for years, but after seeing that, never going back again. END
BEGIN NOW       Scary. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't go to this bar unless you wish to be attacked by a bartender. END
BEGIN NOW      One of the bartenders first ignored me, then when I asked for a beer, started screaming profanities at me and then actually put his hands on me and started pushing me around. END
BEGIN NOW      I can only imagine that if I had resisted him shoving me around, he would've quickly escalated to striking me, since none of this was provoked in any way. END
BEGIN NOW      I will never go back there again, even though I've been going there since they opened. END
BEGIN NOW      My friends are all boycotting this place because of this asshole, too. END
BEGIN NOW     Once a biker bar, now more hipster but the drinks are decent and the prices very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      Nice outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW      Only downside is everyone smokes. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh. END
BEGIN NOW      and cash only (although they have an atm)!. END
BEGIN NOW     The majority of the people at this bar have been nothing but gracious and courteous to me. END
BEGIN NOW      They've allowed me to bring in my dog, and it has been fine. END
BEGIN NOW      Tonight, a bartender on duty, someone that I had met on other visits, was in rare form. END
BEGIN NOW      He was discourteous. END
BEGIN NOW      He was argumentative. END
BEGIN NOW      He was mean. END
BEGIN NOW      I think he was belligerently drunk. END
BEGIN NOW      I have been a bartender and have managed bars and restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW      You can check my yelp history and how often I have written Yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW      Almost never. END
BEGIN NOW      If interested, you can ask me which restaurants or bars I've managed. END
BEGIN NOW      This sucked writing down one of my own, and I've never written a negative review of another bar before. END
BEGIN NOW      It was simply the most offensively I've ever been treated in any bar or restaurant, ever, before or after working in the industry. END
BEGIN NOW     I stopped by for the Prince tribute last week. END
BEGIN NOW       Got there fairly early, just before 5pm. END
BEGIN NOW      The CASH ONLY sign at the bar was an unpleasant surprise, and the ATM in the bar is one of those I just don't trust. END
BEGIN NOW      Its connection seemed spotty too, as a number of people had issues with errors all in a row. END
BEGIN NOW       I ended up borrowing cash from a friend rather than risk it. END
BEGIN NOW      Decent crowd; not packed and not empty. END
BEGIN NOW       The backyard was actually the fuller part because the weather was nice. END
BEGIN NOW       My friends and I tried a couple of the drink specials which were Prince themed (either raspberry or purple, it seemed). END
BEGIN NOW       Nothing too incredible, but we enjoyed them nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a dive bar, not a cocktail lounge. END
BEGIN NOW       If you approach with that spirit, you'll have fun. END
BEGIN NOW     CASH ONLY (only downside, besides the parking meters which are ridiculously expensive). END
BEGIN NOW      $17 pitcher of Racer 5. END
BEGIN NOW      Great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll be back next time I'm in the area. END
BEGIN NOW     Two words: dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Personally, I'm a fan of the idea of dive bars. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean, who doesn't love cheap drinks? I know that I do. END
BEGIN NOW      Especially living in the Bay Area, anything that can keep some money in my pockets makes me pretty happy. END
BEGIN NOW     Cash. END
BEGIN NOW      Only. END
BEGIN NOW      Ouch. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not someone who carries cash. END
BEGIN NOW      That makes it so I drink less at places like this. END
BEGIN NOW      It also has limited space inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I tend to run cool, so I like to be inside which can be rough when it's busy. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a pool table which is frequently occupied. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm no pool shark but I enjoy putting my terrible physics and geometry skills to use. END
BEGIN NOW     especially under the influence. END
BEGIN NOW      It's always a good idea. END
BEGIN NOW     So three stars. END
BEGIN NOW      It's close and easy to get to but nothing super fancy or spectacular, over the top service. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a dive bar so yeah. END
BEGIN NOW     expect that. END
BEGIN NOW     Dive bars are more my style. END
BEGIN NOW       This spot has some real charm. END
BEGIN NOW       Awesome outdoor patio and smoking lounge. END
BEGIN NOW      All sorts of characters, friendly fast bartenders, cool decor, and just that nice fun weirdo vibe. END
BEGIN NOW       Cash only!. END
BEGIN NOW     like yelp said "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW     I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW     " I just don't feel safe or welcomed going into that place I will say the redeeming factor are the cute dogs just hanging out around their owners. END
BEGIN NOW     Jumped to my Top 5 favorite Bars I've ever been to. END
BEGIN NOW     Punk Bar with Pinball and great outside seating! Hell yeah! Service was good, prices were fair, and jukebox selection was On Point!. END
BEGIN NOW     This place seemed a little too much for my style when I first saw it from the outside (as it looks like your average hard core dive bar, often with motorcycle groups hanging around out front). END
BEGIN NOW      However I found it actually quite nice once I ventured inside. END
BEGIN NOW      The area I like best is the back patio, which has a nice beer garden feel. END
BEGIN NOW      I came here during the day but j can imagine it being a very poppin' place at night--it seems like a fun place to have drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW      Will come back again at night. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool place with a typical dive-bar vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only so be prepared - I almost wasn't! Outside was probably my favorite - a fair amount of seating, and they allow dogs. END
BEGIN NOW      The problem is that most dogs have owners, and some of those owners haven't trained their dog how to interact with other dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     Good drinks, bottled beer is probably the best bet. END
BEGIN NOW     it would be better with music at the Patio. END
BEGIN NOW     And gentrification is complete. END
BEGIN NOW       What used to be a laid back blues spot is now patronized by Hells Angels, never thought I  would see that at Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW       Gentrification : game, set, match. END
BEGIN NOW     It's good straight to the point bar. END
BEGIN NOW      I like to drink and they like to pour them, for a fee, of coarse. END
BEGIN NOW      It's my regular waterhole for the past 5 yrs or so. END
BEGIN NOW      They let you bring in outside food and it's one of the few places around that has a private patio to enjoy the nice weather and friends when the time calls for it. END
BEGIN NOW     Note: Be sure to hit an ATM because it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW     I love Heart and Dagger, yep it is a bar, but it is also the super sweet spot to shoot pool by my house, plus you can bring in your own food. END
BEGIN NOW     awesome! I came to the stairs in the front of the establishment and I looked up at them thinking, "Wow, how am I going to do this with one foot?"  The bouncer, Gary, was really cool, he helped get me up there so I could have fun inside with all the other bipeds. END
BEGIN NOW     lol. END
BEGIN NOW     There is always such a cool crowd at this place, no matter what you like. END
BEGIN NOW       The juke box offers some really great songs, the kind of songs that remind you of moments in your life that seemingly make you smile. END
BEGIN NOW       I think last night I heard an old "Wham" song that lifted my mood. END
BEGIN NOW      We watched a ton of Raider fans playing pool and basking in the glory of their win last night at the Battle of the Bay. END
BEGIN NOW       While the football game put my friend in a bad mood, the Raider fans were happy---let them have this little moment, it is not very often it happens ;)We attempted to go out to the patio in the back, and the ramp down into that area was yet another challenge for my one footed self. END
BEGIN NOW       But none to worry, there was a guy working at that back area too who helped me get around. END
BEGIN NOW       I have visited this spot for several years and have always had a memorable time--whether those memories be awesome, weird, annoying, ridiculous or fun, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     I always leave with a memory. END
BEGIN NOW       Heart and Dagger is always on the crawl list for birthdays, and pretty much the "stand by" for any night. END
BEGIN NOW       We can play pool or pinball, listen to music, watch pretty disturbing movies on the TV, hang out in the patio, or just sit inside. END
BEGIN NOW       I am sure to run into friends from the neighborhood at any drop in, so that is always cool when I am out solo. END
BEGIN NOW       Stephani Smiles for HND ;). END
BEGIN NOW     Great place to have a beer and chill. END
BEGIN NOW      The outdoor patio is fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give it 5 stars, but occasionally the clientele can get a little. END
BEGIN NOW      roudy. END
BEGIN NOW      And not in a good way. END
BEGIN NOW     The un-dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW      I used to like this place, but the clientele is all highbrow now. END
BEGIN NOW      I never liked that it was cash only, but I still love the jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW      The last time I was there the skinny bearded doorman kept shouting across the bar to the bartender which was super annoying. END
BEGIN NOW      I was unimpressed with his need for attention. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe early in the day this place is better but when it's crowded, nah. END
BEGIN NOW      I was particularly amused by the weather-denying girl in the tank top showing off her tattoos as everyone else in the bar was in a coat and scarf because it was freezing outside and they had all of the doors open. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe in 1992 that would be impressive, but in 2016 you are one of many. END
BEGIN NOW      Put your coat on, sweety. END
BEGIN NOW      You'll catch your death. END
BEGIN NOW     Terrible bar with terrible staff. END
BEGIN NOW      Rude door people causing fights with new patrons, and that was before anyone had a chance to order a drink. END
BEGIN NOW      Not sure how a business with such terrible customer service stays in business. END
BEGIN NOW      I wouldn't come back here again if you paid me!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Let me just say, I've been here only a handful of times. END
BEGIN NOW       I don't come here enough. END
BEGIN NOW     It reminds me of some of my favorite dives when I lived in the City, just wish I lived within walking distance ;)Great roadhouse atmosphere inside, and a chill backyard area. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome place to come any day of week. END
BEGIN NOW      They pool tables and arcade games. END
BEGIN NOW      Cold beer on tab and bottled with a place to drink outside. END
BEGIN NOW      Mediocre pricing but they aren't shy on their pours. END
BEGIN NOW     This is my go to dive bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Super chill vibe, mostly locals, and cool kids. END
BEGIN NOW      There's a pool table, juke box and tables outside where you can bring the dogs, pizza and a board game. END
BEGIN NOW     what's not to like??Drinks are decent enough, I recommend sticking to beer, racer 5 on tap. END
BEGIN NOW     people seem to like the bloody Mary's and mimosa are perfect pre or post brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here late at night and have had a completely different experience than now. END
BEGIN NOW      Today, we arrived at the bar closer to sunset and hung out on the patio with my $3 beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The ambiance and other patrons were really mellow and enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW      It's cheap, so that is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender, however, seemed to enjoy taking out her life's disappointments on the customers. END
BEGIN NOW      I would've rather served myself. END
BEGIN NOW      It won't keep me from returning, just yet. END
BEGIN NOW     My favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      They play great rock and roll inside, and the beer garden is a fantastic place to spend an afternoon, or play cards late into the night. END
BEGIN NOW      There's tons of food in the neighborhood that you can bring in, and they're dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      The pool scene is competitive and the table is better than average for a 'dive' bar (which the Dagger barely qualifies as). END
BEGIN NOW      There's a great mix of people from East Bay Rats to local yuppies to SF expat hipsters and everyone gets along. END
BEGIN NOW      It gets crowded but not too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW     Just don't sit at the end of the bar by the men's bathroom -- you'll only smell urinal cakes all night. END
BEGIN NOW      Unless you're into that I guess. END
BEGIN NOW     All hail the Duke! It was by the gracious invitation of His Majesty himself that the girlfriend &amp; I came to Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW      &amp; what a lovely Dukedom it is. END
BEGIN NOW     The Heart &amp; Dagger is sort of a dive bar, sort of. END
BEGIN NOW      It's too well-lit inside to really be a total dive. END
BEGIN NOW      It's divey in a hipster-ish kind of way. END
BEGIN NOW      But the hipster to real people ratio isn't too high, so it's still cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Full bar, impressive booze selection, nice cocktails, decent brews on tap, great Happy Hour deals, pinball/ video games &amp; pool table inside, dog-friendly patio out back, &amp; motorcycle parking right in front off the street. END
BEGIN NOW      It's all good. END
BEGIN NOW     We had a chill time time sipping a few drinks (but only a few, it's cash only here, I had loads of plastic but not a whole lotta green on me) &amp; watching Markus' reign of terror on the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW      Until, at last, he was narrowly defeated by a very pretty young lady. END
BEGIN NOW      Who says chivalry is dead?Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW      I like it. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll have to return as often as possible to see the Duke, his fair Dukedom &amp; any other shenanigans afoot. END
BEGIN NOW     Made my way over to oakland to meet up some friends at this sweet lil spot. END
BEGIN NOW      Surrounded by plenty of parking and food it was a nice change up from SF. END
BEGIN NOW      It is a cash only bar some come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW      Full bar with some good beer on tap, and one dude holding down the fort on a saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW      ( he was wicked fast). END
BEGIN NOW      Outside is a sweet lil patio for a awesome place to relax and chat( bench seating) and the fresh air was great. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices for drinks were right on, and no overly pricey with some good pours. END
BEGIN NOW     Cheap drinks, outdoor space, punk rock music -- YES. END
BEGIN NOW     You can smoke. END
BEGIN NOW      Here. END
BEGIN NOW      And drink. END
BEGIN NOW      A nice well whisky and a good pour. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only. END
BEGIN NOW      They check ID very professionally. END
BEGIN NOW      The people who work there are people, not hipster asshats or attitudinal testosteronies. END
BEGIN NOW      i like it, if you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW      Ahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW     I can see this place is going to be my favorite bar in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW     -Great bartender, totally personable and cool. END
BEGIN NOW     -Cool door guy, huge laugh!-Great patio, the likes of which are hard to find around here. END
BEGIN NOW     -Giant Lemons. END
BEGIN NOW     -Good mix of all types at the bar, everyone in a good mood. END
BEGIN NOW     -Drinks were reasonably priced and poured strong. END
BEGIN NOW     -It' close to my house. END
BEGIN NOW     Basically everything needed in a bar that's going to be seeing a lot of this face. END
BEGIN NOW     This place definitely has the dive bar feel to it. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm sure this is a good local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW       What really appeals to me about this places is the outside area in the back. END
BEGIN NOW       There are plenty of tables to sit at. END
BEGIN NOW       Great place to go with some friends to relax with a beer and chat. END
BEGIN NOW        Although it does get busy and filled up so no guarantee you will get a table. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a casual grungy type scene so jeans and causal attire is the standard. END
BEGIN NOW       I like the location and the vibe here though--super chill and relaxed. END
BEGIN NOW       There are a couple pool tables inside as well inside. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd definitely go back for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW     "Oh, he's very popular Ed. END
BEGIN NOW      The sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads - they all adore him. END
BEGIN NOW      They think he's a righteous dude. END
BEGIN NOW     "-- from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"A visit to Heart &amp; Dagger often reminds me of these words. END
BEGIN NOW      As watering holes go, it may not be for every body, but it has a strikingly wide array of fans. END
BEGIN NOW      And for us fans, it holds a piece of our hearts. END
BEGIN NOW      The vibe is casual (read: 'divey'), distinctly Oakland, with a wild undercurrent befitting a David Lynch film. END
BEGIN NOW      A biker bar only 'modestly' gentrified by neo-Oaklandites/wannabees/over-incomed geeks, to which I confess a partial complicity. END
BEGIN NOW       The playground segments into roughly three arenas:  (1) Bar area, where the bees get their honey -- and the barkeeps, both efficient and commanding, do a great job keeping the drones and workers happy. END
BEGIN NOW      Beer specials and shots of liquor are an excellent value, especially during HH, when my lovely Bulliet Manhattans are especially generous. END
BEGIN NOW      (2) Patio, definitely favored by the dog-partnered and smoking clientele, and seems to collect the more regular patrons. END
BEGIN NOW      Gossip is overheard, smiles are witnessed, wafting cigarette smoke is inhaled. END
BEGIN NOW      Water from two giant ThermosTM coolers is free and easily accessed for both two and four-legged visitors back here. END
BEGIN NOW     And then there is (3), the pool table. END
BEGIN NOW       Where I learned, thanks to tutelage from billiards Maestro M and a few tips from other regulars, to now actually almost *not* suck at pool-playing. END
BEGIN NOW       Back to (3) in a bit. END
BEGIN NOW      For the bar en masse though: at its heart of gold though does push the tip of its dagger, as visits here have not always been a feel-good utopian experience. END
BEGIN NOW      I've seen people verbally insulted or kicked out for debatable reasons by the staff (actually mostly just one staff member, whose shifts are minimal); heard obnoxious comments by drunk and/or loud bigots; spied sketchy characters sporting knives in their back pocket, and witnessed a few "lively" disagreements over 8-ball. END
BEGIN NOW      Admittedly, H&amp;D is an onion with many layers, and not all those layers are pretty. END
BEGIN NOW       The trifling edginess is in reality as much an allure as a downer, and a metaphor and microcosm of our world and city and a reminder that good or bad you're still a part of it so why not be a positive part or at the very least learn how to deal with it? In reality, I don't wax all philosophic like that when I visit here. END
BEGIN NOW      Which brings us back to (3):  I do, truly, enjoy the regular pool players, and the competition and camaraderie I'm fortunate to have shared. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm a square peg for several reasons in H&amp;D, but the bonding with other such pegs or non-pegs is the reason I love to visit. END
BEGIN NOW      And on those visits, I get to practice my shot, nurse my bourbon, and inhale the simple sideways joys that life has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW     Can one sum up H&amp;D in a single catchphrase?  "All for one, one for all, just watch your wallet and drink. END
BEGIN NOW     " "You don't have to be a biker to come, but it don't hurt if you are one. END
BEGIN NOW     " "A bar of inimitable substance and a multitude of substances. END
BEGIN NOW     " Nah . END
BEGIN NOW      screw that. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart and Dagger defies an easy Yelp review description. END
BEGIN NOW      And I'm guessing they like it that way. END
BEGIN NOW      Just be chill, be respectful, be unorthodox, be free, and be yourself. END
BEGIN NOW      It's not to be analyzed. END
BEGIN NOW      Just enjoyed. END
BEGIN NOW     If you like dive bars without the meth mouth, Sons of Anarchy watching patrons, Heart and Dagger will sit very well with you. END
BEGIN NOW      (It's kind of not really even a dive bar, shh)They *are* cash only. END
BEGIN NOW      There is an ATM with a $2. END
BEGIN NOW     25 fee, but you get that back fast because their drinks are so stinkin' cheap-- and strong!There is a pool table room and (the best part), an amazing outdoor patio that is friendly to your cigarette smoking buds. END
BEGIN NOW      It's kind of the perfect place to be on a summer night. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart &amp; Dagger is a solid go-to bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      Come here once &amp; you'll likely become a regular. END
BEGIN NOW     one of my favorite places! cheap drinks, good people, a big back patio that is open late. END
BEGIN NOW      Home made beef jerky, aweful/good movies playing and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      also hosted by some of the best bartenders/doormen you'll meet. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh, almost forgot. END
BEGIN NOW      they have three pinball machines (including walking dead) and a decent pooltable with a good/honest rotation of players. END
BEGIN NOW     Love heart and dagger. END
BEGIN NOW      My go to spot when I need a very laid back, wind down, kind of day. END
BEGIN NOW     I drink too much. END
BEGIN NOW       I came to that realization, drunk, during a disappointing pizza experience (why the fuck my bf drove us all the way to oakland for pizza who knows?)   What to do at 11pm on weeknight, drunk, concerned about how you will pay for Betty Ford and in Oakland?Heart and Dagger saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     Sure, my boyfriend tells me he loves pizza more than me. END
BEGIN NOW      Get me drink. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank the Lord in Heaven he volunteered to DD. END
BEGIN NOW     As Kevin B. END
BEGIN NOW      mentioned, if the Zeitgeist is too far of a hoof to get to, then H and D will do. END
BEGIN NOW       The back yard is pretty big and decked with communal tables for both large and small group outings. END
BEGIN NOW       We arrived armed with IDs out (although no one, but NO ONE in my party looked even remotely underage) and was met with friendly banter from the door man no. END
BEGIN NOW      1. END
BEGIN NOW       At one point I couldn't find my friends--not like the place is really that big, so I blame jet-lag for my confusion--and went back out onto the street to look for them. END
BEGIN NOW       Door man no. END
BEGIN NOW      2 had all the charm of a TSA agent upon my re-entry not 2 minutes later. END
BEGIN NOW       Maybe he thought I was some a-hole ABC cop trying to pull a fast one on him?  I wish the US could just lighten up a bit on ID checking, but I get why they can't. END
BEGIN NOW       Anyway, this place is an interesting replacement for The Serenader, if, however, not in keeping with the vibe of that which existed for decades in this very spot. END
BEGIN NOW       -a place where bitchin' BBQ reigned in the backyard and my white face was a minority. END
BEGIN NOW     Great dive bar to drink at on a hot summer afternoon - The big back patio is usually bustling, but not too crowded to get a seat at a table (usually). END
BEGIN NOW       Good beer selection, good service, good prices. END
BEGIN NOW       Ive seen people set up picnics on the patio tables so it's pretty cool that they let you do that. END

BEGIN NOW      So I jumped into my Whip Black Beauty and rolled to Oak town . END
BEGIN NOW      I grabbed a parking spot right across the street. END

BEGIN NOW      If you are looking to meet up with a group of friends this place has a really big patio with plenty of space. END
BEGIN NOW      Also it is cash only, so be ready for that. END
BEGIN NOW      Loved coming here and will be back. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a neat, inexpensive, kind of gnarly bar in downtown Oakland. END

BEGIN NOW     -many patrons wear leather and tats. END
BEGIN NOW      clientele on the edge of heavy metal. END
BEGIN NOW     This bar has a genuine rock 'n' roll atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     Ah such a gem. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend took me here to play pool about a month ago and now I go about once a week. END
BEGIN NOW      There is usually rock music playing and something weird on the TV. END
BEGIN NOW      However, If there is a game on then it will be on the TVs. END
BEGIN NOW      They have pool and a couple of arcade games like pinball and buck hunter. END
BEGIN NOW      They have an awesome outside patio with a bunch of picnic tables. END
BEGIN NOW       You can take drinks outside and people can smoke out there too. END
BEGIN NOW     You can bring your dog! There are usually at least two dogs in the place which is so awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM. END
BEGIN NOW     No food, but there are food places next door and you can bring food in. END
BEGIN NOW      Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Well, my Yelp buddy Max has been going here for a while, and given that it's a six-minute walk from my house, I really have no excuse for not getting here sooner. END
BEGIN NOW      Anyway, I've seen the light! This place is great. END
BEGIN NOW      Pool tables are so rare here in NorCal! And a patio!And this place is right next to the parking are under the 580!. END
BEGIN NOW     Decent prices, nice patio when it's warm outside. END
BEGIN NOW     They allow dogs which is a plus. END
BEGIN NOW     Good spot to hang low. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a saloon. END
BEGIN NOW     My head hurts, and it has nothing to do with what I drank last night. END
BEGIN NOW       Water; I should start learning to drink more water. END
BEGIN NOW       But what's a poor girl to do when a bar insists on serving her most favourite whiskey at such amazing prices??Heart &amp; Dagger - For years, I'd walked by this place too afraid of my own shadow to venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW       Then one day, I came across a photo someone took of the outside and discovered that they kicked it up a few dozen notches on their curbside appeal. END
BEGIN NOW       Then, The C. END
BEGIN NOW      made me meet him here before showtime. END
BEGIN NOW       Who knew that it would become a small trend?I now can proudly say that I overcame my misguided fears and have found a sweet little spot on the ever changing face of Lakeshore Ave to call home. END
BEGIN NOW       This bar is perfect in its divey-ness, has a huge patio for perfect summer evenings, a nice little pool table that only costs $1 a game, and has an awesome jukebox that plays Flogging Molly and David Bowie!  Plus, the prices on the drinks are super inexpensive, and the bartenders are more than kindly souls that'll make you think of Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW     You, too, should overcome your fears and check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW       I feel myself lucky to have been introduced. END
BEGIN NOW     Always fun. END
BEGIN NOW     dive bar with a great crowd!!! Cash only FYI. END
BEGIN NOW      Dog friendly which is cool and outside private patio. END
BEGIN NOW     great place!!!. END
BEGIN NOW     This establishment is hateful. END
BEGIN NOW      I have never been treated so rudely. END
BEGIN NOW      I bought one drink and tried to take a picture on my 21st birthday and the customers and employees were malicious in a creepy way. END
BEGIN NOW      There was no wrong doing on my part, and yet my friend and I were assaulted by the bouncer and he tried to kick my friend. END
BEGIN NOW      All we wanted to do was take a picture which we were told was okay, but the customers sitting around the mural were egotistical. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead of the bouncer helping us get a picture he told us to take, he was on the side of the rude customer. END
BEGIN NOW      We just wanted to have a good time but that's obviously not possible there. END
BEGIN NOW      They were nothing but a bunch of creepy douche bags. END
BEGIN NOW      Good luck at this bar. END
BEGIN NOW      I would give this place 0 stars, if I could. END
BEGIN NOW     When Zeitgeist is just too far away. END
BEGIN NOW     The Heart &amp; Dagger Saloon wins on the name alone, but on a sunny day after a picnic on Lake Merritt, it's a great place to relax with friends. END
BEGIN NOW      Like Zeitgeist across the bay, it's got a biker motif and strong beer on tap, along with a popular backyard for catching up with friends. END
BEGIN NOW      This place also has pool tables and a well-stocked jukebox (also like Zeitgeist), so it's better designed for long stays instead of a quick drink, and the crowd gets friendlier as the afternoon goes on. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're having a thirsty afternoon in the East Bay, quench here. END
BEGIN NOW     Sooo ran to Heart and Dagger for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW      After a long day. END
BEGIN NOW      Stood there while the ex zz top member bartender serves about 5 people that came in after I did. END
BEGIN NOW      he finally notices my 6'5 dude . END
BEGIN NOW      And I "wave" to motion "over here" . END
BEGIN NOW      Since I'm paying. END
BEGIN NOW     He emulates my wave . END
BEGIN NOW     extra dramatic then begins to reprimand me tell me to never wave at him again or he will just ignore me . END
BEGIN NOW      I said well I just waved cause you asked the guy I'm with what he wanted and I'm buying sooo. END
BEGIN NOW     He said NO SERIOUSLY I DONT CARE. END
BEGIN NOW     I wish I had a drink in my hand so I could throw it on him. END
BEGIN NOW     FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW      And especially THAT BARTENDER . END
BEGIN NOW     I miss places where black people were allowed and treated with the same respect as the transplants . END
BEGIN NOW     He felt completely justified coming at the ONLY black couple in the bar like that. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe I'm sensitive but really FUCK THAT PLACE. END
BEGIN NOW      May it burn to the ground and be resurrected as the serenader again . END
BEGIN NOW     One word for this establishment. END
BEGIN NOW      RACIST. END
BEGIN NOW      We are professional, well educated, LATINO couple in our 40's, born &amp; raised in SF and have lived in Lake Merritt for 10 years. END
BEGIN NOW      We decided to have a beer on a Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW      The tattooed, black haired female bartender took our orders, delivered our beers. END
BEGIN NOW     then THREW OUR CHANGE at us, for no apparent reason. END
BEGIN NOW      Then the heavy set tattooed bartender says KICK ROCKS. END
BEGIN NOW      For those of you who are not familiar with this term. END
BEGIN NOW      Urban Dictionary definition: F*** OFF or GET OUTTA HERE. END
BEGIN NOW      Shocked and utterly disgusted people like this exist in OAKLAND? REALLY? Thought we were imaging this, but Nope. END
BEGIN NOW      Just read all the HIDDEN reviews, exactly the same. END
BEGIN NOW      Bottom line. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're brown or black. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW      THIS ESTABLISHMENT TREATS MINORITIES LIKE GARBAGE. END
BEGIN NOW     Still the most awesomest bar in town!Don't go with attitude and you won't get none, epic back patio and cheap drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      Better like friendly dogs, if not don't bother. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a super dog lovin' joint, if you fear them stay away and don't complain about them being there. END
BEGIN NOW     consider yourself warned. END
BEGIN NOW     Props to Suzy, Allison and Eric. END
BEGIN NOW     damn the whole crew over there makes my day. END
BEGIN NOW      Just pour me a strong drink, talk like a dirty sailor and I'm yours!A Quality, respectful stand up business. END
BEGIN NOW     all haters can walk the plank!!!xoxo!. END
BEGIN NOW     Great bar to play pool and just meet new people. END
BEGIN NOW      Very pet friendly and easy going great jukebox music and a spacious outdoor seating area. END
BEGIN NOW     pretty hipster bar a great improvement from the old bar it use to be. END
BEGIN NOW     She suggested we meet at this bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      I heard about it before and without context imagined it to be a seedy dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW      I arrived first and sat at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender was nice, the drinks were very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      My beer wasn't as cold as I would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd was definitely a varied mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW      I walked around, and checked out the back patio. END
BEGIN NOW      Then decided, this is cool place. END
BEGIN NOW      My date showed up we had a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW       The bartender randomly brought us a couple of free drinks to taste. END
BEGIN NOW      One thing led to another and we left together. END
BEGIN NOW      (It must have been the Funky Cold Medina)I would definitely like to come back and recommend this bar. END
BEGIN NOW     This is the only bar I like in my hood the bartenders actually remember who you are and always treat you friendly regardless of how busy they are. END
BEGIN NOW      The mixed drinks are always good and the beers is always nice and cold. END
BEGIN NOW       I always love when summer is around because it's fun to see what the guest keg will be. END
BEGIN NOW      The music is always great and the movies they play on the background are always entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice vibe and cool place to grab a beer and play a few games on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a giant outdoor patio with tons of tables in the back and lots of arcade games and a pool table inside. END
BEGIN NOW      It was kind of crowded when we went, so it took a while to find a seat and we didn't end up staying long enough to play pool but I would be down to come back and play a few rounds. END
BEGIN NOW     Enjoy being able to sit out back and enjoy the beers. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly staff is always a plus. END
BEGIN NOW     Soft opening tonight. END
BEGIN NOW       Big Daddy on draft. END
BEGIN NOW       Free Lanesplitter pizza. END
BEGIN NOW       Great friends and deep conversation. END
BEGIN NOW       If I didn't have a 10 month at home, I might find myself here MUCH more often. END
BEGIN NOW       Wish you were there Ben. END
BEGIN NOW      :(On the way out I saw local newsletter wordsmith Ken Katz. END
BEGIN NOW       He was enjoying a Negra Modelo and surveying the territory. END
BEGIN NOW       He asked me what I thought and said he looked forward to my Yelp review. END
BEGIN NOW       This one is for you Ken!  Keep up the good confabulation. END
BEGIN NOW       See you in the hood. END
BEGIN NOW     If you like Lucky 13 or Lost Weekend in Alameda, you will love Heart and Dagger Saloon. END
BEGIN NOW       Check 'er out!. END
BEGIN NOW     One star for every sip of beer before my dog and I got booted. END
BEGIN NOW     She was barking at another dog. END
BEGIN NOW      Which I get is annoying and cause for concern. END
BEGIN NOW      But she was only barking because she was leashed, and wanted to go greet the other dog. END
BEGIN NOW      And she was only leashed because within a minute of walking in I was told I had to leash her. END
BEGIN NOW      Which would have been fine and fair except that no other dogs were leashed. END
BEGIN NOW      Which puts my girl in a weird situation where everyone else is meeting and greeting and she's tied down in a corner. END
BEGIN NOW       Hence the barking. END
BEGIN NOW      I kind of wanted to point all this out at the time, but it's been my experience that nothing good comes from arguing with bouncers, so we left. END
BEGIN NOW      Which sucks! For the 3 minutes we were there it seemed like a cool little dive. END
BEGIN NOW      We live around the corner, and I was hoping this could be our end up after walks around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been there a few times and now I live a few blocks behind it so I'll be there a few times more. END
BEGIN NOW     Trumer and a burger from next door. END
BEGIN NOW     Kwik Way is theshit andthis place is lucky to be next door. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a fine bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Decent. END
BEGIN NOW     Dog central park today in the back. END
BEGIN NOW     But I got a burger and a beer,so nocomplaints. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is cool if you are a trite, predictable cliché of a hipster / fauxpunk. END
BEGIN NOW      If you like waiting 20 minutes for mediocre service and a can of PBR at 500% mark-up, please come on down to Heart and Dagger!Idiots are more than welcome to enjoy pretending at rebellion while leaning on broken, unusable pin ball machines. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't forget that we offer a special discount if you are one of those girls with no particular talent and so you take your clothing off on stage assuming that means you're a burlesque dancer. END
BEGIN NOW      Please hold your next "desperate for mom's attention" meeting here and get a free pitcher of horse piss! I mean Tecate!. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to like this place!  What the crap happened?  The bartender wasn't just rude, it was some whole other level of maximum hatred!  Did she think I was someone else?  Someone who had stolen her husband, killed her dog, and burned down her house?  Because that's what it felt like. END
BEGIN NOW       Damn. END
BEGIN NOW     After eventually getting a beer, we head over to play the pinball machines and they are in such a sorry state as to basically be a total ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW       Heart and Dagger, I can take a hint. END
BEGIN NOW       You don't want me to come there and spend my money, so I shant. END
BEGIN NOW     Okay, I admit I was only in here for 15 minutes, meeting friends before seeing a movie at the Grand Lake Theatre. END
BEGIN NOW       However, for a dive bar it's not really divey at all. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, it's dark and has pool tables. END
BEGIN NOW      But everyone is really nice and the place is clean and not skeazy. END
BEGIN NOW      Not only that but there's a great back patio. END
BEGIN NOW      There's lots of bike parking out front and they don't mind if you lock up onto the railing either. END
BEGIN NOW      The bouncer didn't give me any grief about running in then out, parking my bike right next to the front door (I asked if it was okay) and then leaving again without actually getting a drink. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely recommended as a nice neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks are inexpensive and stiff . END
BEGIN NOW     Cash only is a  bit irritating. END
BEGIN NOW     Only one toilet Plenty of seating outside . END
BEGIN NOW     I felt comfortable here and I think that it was because everyone was so friendly and engaging. END
BEGIN NOW      I should remember to visit that side of the lake for a more often especially if I'm in the mood for mustaches, boys who ride bikes , tattoos and a slick comb over, oh wait. END
BEGIN NOW     that is like. END
BEGIN NOW      all day , everyday. END
BEGIN NOW      Welp, alrighty then. END
BEGIN NOW     LOVE this bar!  It's charmingly divey, without being disgusting. END
BEGIN NOW     unlike this one bar I went to recently who's name I will not mention where patrons just dropped trou' and urinated all over the bloody patio - sorry, but that's just nasty. END
BEGIN NOW      I digress. END
BEGIN NOW      H&amp;D's bartenders are hella' friendly and they pour heavy. END
BEGIN NOW       Seriously, I can typically hold my booze pretty well and one $10 pint-glass-sized-long-island had me buzzing preeetty hard. END
BEGIN NOW       There's a pool table that's almost always occupied by friendly people who are happy to work you into the rotation, puppies! (yes, puppies. END
BEGIN NOW      It's dog-friendly), a nice outdoor patio for the smokers, tasty food just next door, a jukebox, arcade games, and an ATM machine (they don't take cards). END
BEGIN NOW       It's really nice to have this bar within walking distance of our house. END
BEGIN NOW       It's by far the best neighborhood bar I've experienced yet. END
BEGIN NOW     For saving my arse literally. END
BEGIN NOW      And having clean facilites. END
BEGIN NOW     I had  Trader's Joes and was loaded up with my bags when the urge hit to use the Bathroom like super bad like Damn I wish I had on a Diaper Bad like I might have to take a shit right here right now on the sidewalk and be on the bus hella shitty- like ( and deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW      I dropped my bags and rushed into the Bar praying it would be friendly and not you-gotta buy-to shit. END
BEGIN NOW      I was id checked ( I do look like a kid) and raced to the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW      Praying no body else would have to come in cause the bathroom was super tiny with one stall and no way to pretend the stink wasn't emerging from me. END
BEGIN NOW     And there it goes a female patron enters just as I uh let go. END
BEGIN NOW      Can't help but smell that!-Sigh- Oh well I am grateful it went down this way and not on the bus (feeling deeply deeply ashamed). END
BEGIN NOW     Well made, quality drinks with a cool dive bar feel. END
BEGIN NOW      There's pinball and pool which makes it great for bro-nights. END
BEGIN NOW      The patrons are stylish and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I really like the back patio area. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is very cool. END
BEGIN NOW       Great drinks and service. END
BEGIN NOW       Next time I hope to get a spot on the über-cool patio. END
BEGIN NOW       I can't remember the last time I had booze and played the video game Galaga (spelling?) Anyway, I had a great time and will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW     This used to be the go-to bar for my friends and fellow Bay Area Derby girls. END
BEGIN NOW      It was our hang out, we've given them a lot of business. END
BEGIN NOW      But then today after a beautiful sunny day and a skate around the lake we decided to stop in for a drink. END
BEGIN NOW      We looked on the outside for any sign about "no shoes, no service" but there wasn't one so we went in. END
BEGIN NOW      Two of us had shoes, I did not. END
BEGIN NOW      We proceeded to order our drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      We saw a cute dog sitting on a bar stool and gave it some love. END
BEGIN NOW      I got my beer and then a manager type abruptly told us we had to take our skates off, so we did. END
BEGIN NOW      My friends and I grabbed our drinks and headed to the beer garden in the back (me in my socks). END
BEGIN NOW      I took a few sips of my refreshing beer and Miss Cranky Pants told me that I must be wearing *shoes* or I have to leave. END
BEGIN NOW      I did not have shoes so I got my money back from my beer and left the premises. END
BEGIN NOW      It's too bad the woman was so prickly. END
BEGIN NOW      The woman could've been much friendlier and more professional in her approach towards us but she treated the three of us with such disdain that it left us confused and surprised about her behavior. END
BEGIN NOW      There was no sign posted about shoes in the front (only a sign about a 2 drink minimum). END
BEGIN NOW     they allow dogs in the establishment and they allow people to smoke pot AND there is no handicap access to the establishment. END
BEGIN NOW     but somehow stocking feet is not acceptable? Would they ban people in bare feet wearing flip-flops? The rules just seem a little off and we certainly didn't deserve the rude treatment. END
BEGIN NOW      Me, my friends, and the Bay Area Derby girls will not be returning to the Heart &amp; Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     Proud to say this is my neighborhood bar! Love the atmosphere, puppy dogs and staff!. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't usually review bars, but I loooooove Heart and Dagger! Beers are yummy, drinks are pretty good, but the best part is the patio. END
BEGIN NOW      People bring their dogs back there, it's awesome!We'll usually come here and chill in the patio, maybe play some pin ball, then move to the next bar. END
BEGIN NOW      We usually hit up Lanesplitter Pizza afterwords because it's so closeby. END
BEGIN NOW      Delish. END
BEGIN NOW     Bah! This bar has so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes! Go on a sunday and get mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW      Sit out in the patio, and enjoy your day. END
BEGIN NOW      then go wander to the lake and stare at the hobo geese eating cigarette butts. END
BEGIN NOW     Noooooo, don't go on a regular night. END
BEGIN NOW      the shape of the place is sooo weird and awkward, either you're in the way of the pool table or standing by a pole in the front, squeezed by the bar, or freezing in the back patio slowly absorbing lung cancer. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked for a gin and tonic and got soda and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW      talk about the most extreme of a buzz kill. END
BEGIN NOW       Soda is the hill billy cousin to city gal tonic. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, just because this bar is called Heart &amp; Dagger doesn't mean you get to be a mean jerk. END
BEGIN NOW     I repeat, get week-end day drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW     Cool, neighborhood-y bar with a lovely back patio area, a friendly staff and a great selection of beers and booze. END
BEGIN NOW     There's good affordable food nearby and the place is usually filled with friendly locals. END
BEGIN NOW     I dig it!. END
BEGIN NOW     So, my friend just moved to the bay area from good ol' NYC, and we decide to have a night out on the town, to welcome her to Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       Granted, we're both tired and lame after a week of work, so a night out on the town ends up consisting of one drink then home. END
BEGIN NOW     HOWEVER. END
BEGIN NOW     My one drink was a super cheap aged Jameson, and hers was a super cheap PBR tallboy. END
BEGIN NOW       WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW     We met my friend there whose pet pug (I'm sorry, he's a service dog, for real) is a regular at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Seriously, he sits on a bar stool. END
BEGIN NOW       WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW     We headed out back where it was beautiful outside, despite being the end of October. END
BEGIN NOW       WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW     On the back patio, my friend starts getting agitated. END
BEGIN NOW       I don't know why. END
BEGIN NOW       I realize it's because half the people here are not just smoking cigarettes, and where she's been living, that's still illegal. END
BEGIN NOW       I mean, technically, it is here too, but really: WELCOME TO OAKLAND. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger is a great dive bar located near the historic Grand Lake Theater, conveniently nestled amongst other eateries and shops. END
BEGIN NOW     - easy going vibe- back patio- outside food friendly (you can bring your own)- dog friendly-  fun (pinball, pool table, juke box)- be sure to bring photo ID - i. END
BEGIN NOW     e. END
BEGIN NOW      license, passport. END
BEGIN NOW      State law requires that every patron have one (even if you look 21+) otherwise they get fined big time. END
BEGIN NOW     - cash only (ATM on the premises). END
BEGIN NOW     CASH ONLY! cool patio in the back and cool staff. END
BEGIN NOW      nice local hang out. END
BEGIN NOW      it's very low key and chill. END
BEGIN NOW      i'd go back if i was in the area and it was happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     Went on a whim after a friend recommed the place to me. END
BEGIN NOW     I had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW      and too much to drink. END
BEGIN NOW     lol. END
BEGIN NOW      they ordered me a cab and someone offered to move my car for me since they had street sweeping early the next morning. END
BEGIN NOW     what a nice thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW     I would totally go back the vibe was pretty cool and the bartender was great. END
BEGIN NOW     biker looking guy with a goatee. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd like to give props but, I can't remember his name. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW     Well, this was a fun night!  A little dive-y, dark, and grungy, but I live down the street and have always wanted to see inside!  I ended up getting a mimosa for 4$ (I think. END
BEGIN NOW     ) which was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW       The back patio is pretty cool, but I couldn't stay long because it was beyond freezing the night I went. END
BEGIN NOW       Also, do you think it might be a good idea to put lights outside?  Or, more lights outside?  I mean, its cool and all to sit and drink in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW      but more fun to see the person you came with!  I really prefer the two seater RIGHT by the windows inside by the bar- so quaint and cozy!I read they once had a mechanical bull. END
BEGIN NOW      am I wrong?  If they did, crowds would multiply, and I would be there every Sat!. END
BEGIN NOW     Decent place, but the bartender could certainly have been less of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW     What other bar would explicitly say on their website that their mission is to have cheap drinks with no cover?Hey, Yelp stalkers (that are dwindling in numbers every day)! Want to stalk for reals? I'm here every Friday without fail because this bar is so freaking awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      Though it's not on the ridiculously cheap Happy Hour special list ($3 drafts and well drinks), their Dirty Martinis are some of the best I've ever had (still at a super cheap price!). END
BEGIN NOW     Do yourself a favor and get there early to snag a seat on the outdoor patio under the lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW      The Heart and Dagger has friendly service (I need not mention their predecessors), friendly patrons, and an all together relaxed and fun vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      Cash only, and watch out. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll probably steal your seat on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Eek! Methinks not. END
BEGIN NOW     That's exactly how I feel about this place, and the bartender helped out with that feeling. END
BEGIN NOW       By the way this is no Zeitgeist!  That's like calling Taco Bell authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW       Anyway. END
BEGIN NOW     Me and my lady walked in Sunday late evening around 7ish not packed but there was people. END
BEGIN NOW       I thought the layout was nice, games are cool, and yes the Jukebox is the God of Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW       Trust me if it weren't for that jukebox they might have got 1 star. END
BEGIN NOW       Ordered tequila with club soda and a bloody mary for the first round. END
BEGIN NOW       Hmmm I've had better and I wasn't feeling the bartenders dry attitude. END
BEGIN NOW       It's not like I wanted her to do cart wheels but damn girl smile at least. END
BEGIN NOW       We stepped outside to feel the vibe out there since there wasn't much of a vibe at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Beautiful lemon tree, plenty of awkward seating, and a big bummer is you can't hear the music outside. END
BEGIN NOW       We decided one more drink and depending on the bartenders attitude we would decide if we where going to stay or leave. END
BEGIN NOW     Shot of Fernet please and one more tequila with club soda. END
BEGIN NOW       I received what seemed like half a shot for 6 bucks and a half ass thanks. END
BEGIN NOW       The guy next to me ordered a shot of Fernet too and it was beyond obvious his shot was double what was in my glass. END
BEGIN NOW       Whatevs I finished my shot and left. END
BEGIN NOW       You guys can all have this place cause it ain't fulfilling my drunk lover needs. END
BEGIN NOW     From the outside, it looks like someone simply converted their quaint little house into a public bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Inside is a bit more rock n roll, loud music and pool. END
BEGIN NOW      $2 PBR tallies make pretty much any hole in the wall a worthwhile stop for a drink or two. END
BEGIN NOW      The back patio is perfect for a summer evening but gets crowded fast as most of the room out there is taken by tables. END
BEGIN NOW      Dog friendly despite not having the friendliest of dogs. END
BEGIN NOW     You know what I like? Booze. END
BEGIN NOW      You know what else I like? A bar that will give me said booze at a price that won't break my wallet (Ummmm, hello? Uptown? Your $8. END
BEGIN NOW     00 Maker's shot can eat a bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW     )This place is totally going to hit five stars soon. END
BEGIN NOW      There are still a lot of small details that are getting worked out but you know what? The owners are hands on and working on them. END
BEGIN NOW      I see them there almost every single night greeting people, talking to them about improvements. END
BEGIN NOW      hell, I even saw one of them leave their guests they had come in with to help one of their bartenders who had gotten slammed and lost in the weeds. END
BEGIN NOW     I've read the accusations of this place being racist and I just don't know what the hell you people are talking about. END
BEGIN NOW      I can go on about it but giving it any more space than two sentences is giving credence to a line of bullshit that is just reDONKulous. END
BEGIN NOW      There are few places in Oakland that I've found that allow me to feel comfortable with a wide array of friends. END
BEGIN NOW      I can have this as my place to start the night, spend the night, or end the night. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh - did I mention that Lanesplitters usually drops off pizza when they close? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW      free drunk food. END
BEGIN NOW      All you one-star givers can join to Uptown on eating their bag of dicks. END
BEGIN NOW     I knew I would like this place when this was on the juke box while I entered youtube. END
BEGIN NOW     com/watch?v=BIvk… There was once a time when this place was the Serenader and that place scared the daylights out of me. END
BEGIN NOW      The patrons would shout at me when I walked past and I figured that heckling/intimidating patrons with the potential to scare off customers and I totally wrote about it on Yelp and it was #$%&amp;ING FLAGGED AND REMOVED because I violated TOS. END
BEGIN NOW      Well, ha, it took two years for them to pull it. END
BEGIN NOW      And, well, ha, MICHELLE S. END
BEGIN NOW      WILL NOT BE SILENCED! HAHAHAHA!Sorry. END
BEGIN NOW     Anyway, some time ago, I reviewed Zietgiest and was so pissed that the patios seemed to be in SF rather than in the warmer climate of Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Guess what! Enter Heart and Dagger Saloon! I finally stumbled in to check this place out yesterday afternoon (they open at noon or 1 pm on the weekends) and it was a very great anti-brunch and anti-farmer's market thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW      The patrons are very talkative and approachable. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is super friendly and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW      They have an impressive bourbon collection and two types of sangria. END
BEGIN NOW      And, most importantly, a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Now if the Oakland Tamale guy would stop doing the Telegraph bars and come here instead. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW      The name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW      The best thing about this bar is they have cheap drinks and they have a back patio. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not a fan of going to bars where you can bring dogs. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm from the super duper old school. END
BEGIN NOW      Dogs should stay their little furry butts at home. END
BEGIN NOW      As soon as i walked my fly butt out side to find a seat. END
BEGIN NOW      The most ugliest poodle walked up to me and started liking my leg. END
BEGIN NOW      This dog was going in for the kill, his nose was going further up my dress. END
BEGIN NOW      I literally started screaming and telling the dog to get the hell away from me. END
BEGIN NOW      OK i think yawl get the hint I'm not a dog lover. END
BEGIN NOW      Now don't get me wrong I like dogs. END
BEGIN NOW      Bottom line Heart and Dagger the name says it all. END
BEGIN NOW      Please don't spend to much of your life at this bar unless you rock outfits that have skull and bones on them. END
BEGIN NOW      Get my drift. END
BEGIN NOW     3 terrific pinball gamesAttack from Mars (Bally)Creature from the Black Lagoon (Bally)Arabian Nights (Williams)$3. END
BEGIN NOW     50 PBR TallboysDecent jukebox (no autotunes)Mellow people (seemed free of hipsters. END
BEGIN NOW     ). END
BEGIN NOW     I have never been treated so rudely by a bartender (and we all know how they can be sometimes, lol). END
BEGIN NOW      But imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the self-proclaimed OWNER of the place. END
BEGIN NOW      I am still just shocked by her blatant disrespect of my friends and I, I still have absolutely no idea why we were treated in this fashion-- the only cause i could speculate is that I was with mostly people of color. END
BEGIN NOW      shocking for Oakland, but i have racked my brain and that is the only thing i can come up with. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender did not want us there from the second we walked in and she made that very clear. END
BEGIN NOW      Nor did she even care when I tried to address the matter with her, happy to hear she had lost all of our business forever. END
BEGIN NOW      I see that a few other reviewers had similar experiences, how sad. END
BEGIN NOW     All's I know is that I know a LOT of bars in Oakland that at least pretend to care about their customers. END
BEGIN NOW      I will never go back to this bar, it's certainly no good to be so blatantly disrespected, but I'm certainly not going to PAY to be treated that way. END
BEGIN NOW      lol. END
BEGIN NOW     I just moved to Lakeshore from Montclair, and you know what excites me?  The fact that I can walk to a bar and stumble home late at night after. END
BEGIN NOW       You know what doesn't excite me?  The fact that Heart and Dagger Saloon of Oakland is my local bar. END
BEGIN NOW     Let's be honest, I haven't seen this many white people together in one place since Oakland's First Friday (or as I lovingly call it, "White Night"). END
BEGIN NOW       The lay out is funky . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      especially the VIP raised table right as you walk in the door. END
BEGIN NOW       The outside is nice and I will definitely try it again in the summertime, but really, I don't want to go anywhere that makes my "ethnic" friends feel uncomfortable . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW     Looks like we're going to Easy. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger is a-okay. END
BEGIN NOW      The patio is gigantic, probably more room out there than in the actual bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Prices were reasonable, but comparisons to Lucky 13 or similar bars with awesome beer selections and divey vibes are a bit uncalled for; there aren't that many beers on tap, and the crowd there (Saturday afternoon) was more likely to be reading the paper than to be chatting it up with fellow bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW      Dog friendly though!. END
BEGIN NOW     i dunno what i was expecting when i heard this was a biker dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     maybe a little more dive and a little more hott bikers. END
BEGIN NOW     ? parking was easy, directly across the street. END
BEGIN NOW     and well, the spot itself is pretty cool inside with pool tables, pinball machines, and a jukebox. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender worked up some strong drinks and the other patrons were pretty accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW     the patio area was pretty big lined up with park benches to share, but the lighting def needs improving so us cougs could see which cubs are available to hunt! some of my biker friends rave about this spot because of it being biker friendly and maybe it just wasn't the night for them to be there. END
BEGIN NOW     so i'll be back and give it another try, maybe on a saturday. END
BEGIN NOW     check back and i'll let you know!. END
BEGIN NOW     Walked in here for the first time and was like "so THIS is what the Serenader looks like from the inside!"Great out door patio, stiff cheap drinks, good jukebox, men with facial hair . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      sign me up!. END
BEGIN NOW     Where everybody knows your name!We have been going to the Heart and Dagger since it opened, usually with me draped in my cool H and D swag. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a throwback to a great neighborhood bar, with a little punk thrown in. END
BEGIN NOW      We went last night to reintroduce our recently transplanted friends back to the amazing-ness that is the Bay Area, and ran into a group of friends. END
BEGIN NOW      That is what I love about this place! Knowing that our friends all go there, and that we can catch up and hang out on the patio for hours is awesome!Boozy Suzy always makes me a delicious custom made drink when I am hanging out with all of the beer drinking boys, which puts a smile on my face every time. END
BEGIN NOW     The boys love getting Lane-Splitters for dinner, and staying and talking the night away. END
BEGIN NOW      Now, if I can only get Lane Splitters to carry gluten free pizza, I would never leave!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are looking for a dive bar, you can't do much better than this in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      The drinks are cheap, there's a great outdoor seating area and plenty of people watching. END
BEGIN NOW      It gets a little smokey in the patio, but what do you expect from outdoor seating at a bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Pinball and Pool are also big pluses. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the fact that karaoke is not and never will be allowed!They pour great drinks with great prices and a very fun crowd to watch. END
BEGIN NOW     Check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW     I love, love love love Heart and Dagger! It's about time that Oakland got a decent rocker/biker/alternative bar!I've heard people call it a "dive bar" but it's anything but. END
BEGIN NOW      If you love Zeitgeist in SF, imagine a smaller, east bay version. END
BEGIN NOW      That's what you get at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW     Plus, you can actually go and get a few drinks and not spend more than $20. END
BEGIN NOW      The jukebox is loaded with bitchin' tunes. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      The place is Dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      And they let you bring in food from other places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW      And once in a while, Lane Splitters will bring by free pizza that's left over at the end of the night or wrong orders. END
BEGIN NOW     It's cozy and comfy. END
BEGIN NOW      All races, genders, gays, straights welcome. END
BEGIN NOW      It's nice to see a diverse alternative culture and not feel like you walked into a snobby hipster bar for once. END
BEGIN NOW      Heart and Dagger has certainly become my version of "Cheers!". END
BEGIN NOW     I dig this bar, I really do. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is friendly (even the door guys are nice) and there's usually a fun crowd inside. END
BEGIN NOW      My favorite time to visit Heart and Dagger is on a lazy Sunday when the back patio is filled with dogs, cigarettes and tall boys. END
BEGIN NOW      Drinks are reasonably priced, has every amenity you'd ever ask of a dive, and the bathrooms aren't gross! I can only speak for the Men's bathroom, though. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, if you're hungry, Lanesplitters (as well as other awesome grub) is right next to Heart and Dagger, and the bar is totally cool with you bringing a pizza box in to share with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     Additional bonuses: 3 pinball tables and an ATM machine. END
BEGIN NOW      When their ATM machine isn't working, there's a bank 50 feet away. END
BEGIN NOW      The only negative: When the outside patio is closed and the bar is packed, the inside of the bar will make you claustrophobic. END
BEGIN NOW     If I've said it once, I've said it a million times:  This place is great as long as the back yard stays open. END
BEGIN NOW       When they shut it down and start hustling us in at 11 or 11:30 or whenever it is, it is just way too small to accommodate us. END
BEGIN NOW       Inevitably this results in an additional trip either back to the Kona or the Ruby Room. END
BEGIN NOW     I know they're trying to be good neighbors and I can respect that, but the early nightly closing of the outside is a total buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW     While my pals and I were wandering around Oakland on a sunny day, we came here to get a drink and sit at their outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW       It was a bit of a 30-something meat market. END
BEGIN NOW       Since we were not really out on the prowl, it was a sort of hilarious scene. END
BEGIN NOW       We drank mimosas and watched a group of British men hit on any women who'd have them. END
BEGIN NOW       I don't know about what it's like at night or when it's cold, but I found it quite enjoyable in the lovely Oakland sun. END
BEGIN NOW       Not really worth a trip to the East Bay, but good if you're already there. END
BEGIN NOW     3. END
BEGIN NOW     5 stars!It gets knocked back from 4 because the only beer I (kinda) like there is Sierra Nevada. END
BEGIN NOW       But this is a great last stop for when you don't care anymore and you just want to knock back a PBR tallboy or two. END
BEGIN NOW      Classy!   Anywaaaays, it may not be the classiest joint but it is a lot of fun -- there are little video games, a pool table, and a large outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW       The TVs play the randomest crap, and everyone there is just chillin'. END
BEGIN NOW       Gets a little crowded, but that's part of the fun. END
BEGIN NOW      And when you finally get kicked out, the Taco Guys sometimes park their truck outside, so you can grab an organic, free-range, vegetarian-fed taco (it's very important for your 2 a. END
BEGIN NOW     m. END
BEGIN NOW      drunk self to be environmentally friendly) to go with that last PBR. END
BEGIN NOW     Pitchers, pinball, patio! Great neighborhood dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW      good location, average prices, dogs outside. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely plan on going back regularly. END
BEGIN NOW     This is now the bar I call my neighborhood favorite. END
BEGIN NOW       I love that it has an outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW       The one downside is that I'm a nonsmoker so if it's crowded it's hard to get away from the smokers but it's worth it to me to sit outside on a sunny day and enjoy a beer. END
BEGIN NOW       The beers are priced great, especially if you get there early enough for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW       Dogs are allowed in the back which offers some entertainment if there are a few there. END
BEGIN NOW       The bartenders have always been very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW       I haven't been back in a while since the weather has been cold but the next warm, sunny day I have off work I know where I'm headed. END
BEGIN NOW     If the Lexington in SF and Zeitgeist in SF had a love child it would be Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW      In recent years there has been a gaggle of gays moving over to Oakland, myself included, and we needed a gayborhoody hangout. END
BEGIN NOW      I do believe Heart and Dagger fits the bill! A group of us went to Heart and Dagger and we knew we were "home" when Gary, any dyke worth her weight knows this doorman, greeted us! There were hugs all around! He has been working the door at some infamous lesbian parties in SF for years. END
BEGIN NOW      He is an East Bay boy so he is right at home at Heart and Dagger. END
BEGIN NOW      The bar has that "cozy" Lex feeling and the backyard is like Zeigeist's little sister. END
BEGIN NOW      There is also a pool table indoors and it's surrounded by tons of raggedy old bar stools and a couple throne type areas to chill in. END
BEGIN NOW      Random, but welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW      Good, full bar with some attractive bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW      Always a bonus! Prices were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      And don't worry hip straighties, it is a diverse crowd and everyone seems to be welcomed with open arms. END
BEGIN NOW      We like that. END
BEGIN NOW      Diversity good. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's do the math: Cool hangout space+good bar with good prices+backyard space+Gary at the door+plenty of parking across the street = a sweet little gayborhoody spot we plan to frequent. END
BEGIN NOW     Eek!  Methinks never again. END
BEGIN NOW     Went here a few times and thought it was alright. END
BEGIN NOW       After having my bike tires slashed and the bartender refusing service saying "I don't serve blonds" to my male friend. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm done. END
BEGIN NOW     Pros:Patio out backCute dogsCons:Rude bartenderOnly one toilet. END
BEGIN NOW     which clogs and people still piss (and crap) in it until it's fullBike tires SLASHED. END
BEGIN NOW     no sign in sight saying do NOT park your bike herePeople beauregarding the jukebox with annoying musicIf you're willing to put up with idiots for bartenders, nasty toilets, and flat tires please go here!. END
BEGIN NOW     Five stars for a bar?  What caught your eye Tim?  What could possibly be that awesome:This F**&amp;ing place. END
BEGIN NOW     Pinball: Sweet. END
BEGIN NOW     Three of 'em: Even sweeterMaximum Force/ Area 51 arcade game: You mean I can get drunk and kill things ?,Pacman/Froger/Galaga/all sorts of other cool 80's hits, flashback out of the time I was in diapers. END
BEGIN NOW       RadJukebox with Iron Maiden and the Clash? And all sorts of other badass tunes? CheckCheap drinks too? I just shit myself in excitement. END
BEGIN NOW       Maybe I'll go to the bathroom to cl. END
BEGIN NOW     Holy crap there's a patio too?  This place gets my vote and my dollar. END
BEGIN NOW      Its smaller than you expect but the folks tend to be friendly and loud. END
BEGIN NOW       Its a good time and theres tons of parking across the street. END
BEGIN NOW     Like my lady said: It's a dive bar, but without the urine and cigarette stench. END
BEGIN NOW       WHOA. END
BEGIN NOW     I kinda like this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Tuesday night &amp; about twenty patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Sierra Nevada on tap for $3. END

BEGIN NOW     Fairly neat &amp; clean. END
BEGIN NOW     Ping pong table in action in the back patio. END
BEGIN NOW     Bar tender was friendly &amp; helpful with beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW     Mixed crowd on my visit. END
BEGIN NOW     Parking was no big deal (right across the steet. END
BEGIN NOW     A big improvement from the last sh*#hole bar previously residing @ this location. END
BEGIN NOW     Patio looks to be a good spot for hot summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW     Go already!!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Loved the pinball and the backyard seating! Cash only so come prepared. END
BEGIN NOW      Great spot for a bloody mary on a Sunday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW      Bring your pooch along!. END
BEGIN NOW     When this place first opened up, I thought it was pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW       I loved the pinball, back patio &amp; the jukebox was pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW       However, over the last year I've gone there, my impression declined from "great" to "okay" to "absolutely never again will I set foot in the place". END
BEGIN NOW       The first reason I started going was for the pinball, but whatever company leases the machines to the bar (California Amusement Group?) does not keep them in good repair. END
BEGIN NOW       Since they opened, I've been there to play the machines multiple times, and each time, every single one of the 3 games were in such disrepair as to make the game almost a complete waste of money because you couldn't make key shots for scoring (like an intermittent or weak flipper, or a semi-functioning plunger). END
BEGIN NOW       Eventually, I stopped going there as often because of that, but gave it another chance a couple nights ago because my friend's friend was having a birthday party there - BIG mistake. END
BEGIN NOW       My friend (also female) and I waited at the bar to get a drink for over 20 minutes while the bartender completely ignored us, giving no eye contact &amp; no acknowledgement that she saw us, while serving everyone else at the bar, including people who had clearly come up to the bar after us. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm pretty patient when a bar is crowded, because I understand that it's not an easy job. END
BEGIN NOW       However, as we got passed over, time &amp; time again, it was obvious that the bartender just did not want to serve us. END
BEGIN NOW       WTF?  There was even some jerk standing fully behind me who leaned over my shoulder &amp; shouted - "pitcher of Trumer" - who got served while we were still waiting there!  Finally, there was guy standing next to my friend who could see what was going on (who had also come up AFTER us), and then sure as sh*t, the bartender came up to ask HIM what he wanted, so he pointed to us and said "these ladies were first", and she scoffed &amp; said something totally dismissive like "okay whatever" and then reluctantly asked what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW       After she served us, she started ignoring the guy who pointed out that we were next. END
BEGIN NOW       Okayyyyy - wow. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm not sure why we got that kind of treatment, but it felt pretty crappy. END
BEGIN NOW       I sortof wondered whether it was because I was an obvious dyke. END
BEGIN NOW       I couldn't think of any other reason why we got treated that way, unless maybe the bartender just has a problem with other women in general?  (I've seen other reviews by women here who have mentioned crappy treatment by a female bartender here as well). END
BEGIN NOW       In any case, regardless of the reason, this bartender obviously did not want me &amp; my friend's business, and the owners don't care that their patrons get ripped off on their janky pinball machines either, so Mission Accomplished!!!  I will never go there again!Sad, because it had so much potential. END
BEGIN NOW     My favorite neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW      It's cozy. END
BEGIN NOW      The patrons are young, diverse, attractive, and take good care of themselves. END
BEGIN NOW      The bar staff and security are really friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Nice change from comparable larger venues in the City. END
BEGIN NOW      This is where I plan to bring my friends this summer. END
BEGIN NOW     The music hits all my sweet spots--blues, rockabilly, punk, HEAVY METAL. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection is good enough for me--and it's cheap! And if I overkill (which I almost never do anymore) I live right up the street and could crawl home if necessary. END
BEGIN NOW      Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW      If grog and whiskey ain't your thing, then be sure to ask for a Suzie-kazi if Boozie Suzie is slingin shots. END
BEGIN NOW     Need something to pad the sauce so you can see straight despite beer goggles? Head over to Lanesplitter's right next door--OR DRINK SOME MORE UNTIL YOU'VE DRUNK YOURSELF SOBER. END
BEGIN NOW     I thought this place was cute. END
BEGIN NOW      The drinks were great and super cheap. END
BEGIN NOW      We went on a Friday night around 9 and it was packed. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought the outdoor space was great. END
BEGIN NOW      It had cute brick/cobble stone floor, lots of stringed lights and the cutes local puppy. END
BEGIN NOW      I will say that the layout is ridiculous, they could have fit way more tables or at least some drink holding counters. END
BEGIN NOW      i spent most the night reorganizing the space layout in my head. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd seemed a little young, college- single types, but everyone was friendly and calm-ish. END
BEGIN NOW      However it was only 9 and the party was just beginning. END
BEGIN NOW     they have pool table and pin-ball but they were packed and unlikely to be able to play. END
BEGIN NOW     All-n-all: i would go back for a beer and hang. END
BEGIN NOW      but after we left here, we stumbled upon all that is holey in Dive Bars. END
BEGIN NOW       Smitty's Cocktails, review to follow!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Heart and Dagger is my neighborhood  bar hangout. END
BEGIN NOW      For those in the Grand Lake area, it really is convenient which adds to it's draw. END
BEGIN NOW      It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW      It has a cool motorcycle vibe and some tough looking characters that frequent. END
BEGIN NOW      While it has some diversity of character, however, it really is a hipster-ific bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Lanesplitters, the next door pizza joint, will often deliver the pizza at the end of the night. END
BEGIN NOW      GREAT outdoor patio with a fun lemon tree. END
BEGIN NOW      In three words: cheap, convenient and cool. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything I want in a bar: cheap drinks, comfortable back yard to sit and drink in (complete with a huge lemon tree in the center), good jukebox, decent not-to-cool-for-school bartenders, a first person shooter video game, and a non-douchey clientele. END
BEGIN NOW     I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW     Can you say cheap drinks? Well, I use to pop up at this place before Heart and Dagger took over. END
BEGIN NOW      The mgmt kept changing and it wasn't always safe to go, but they had great bands. END
BEGIN NOW      It was called Serenadas. END
BEGIN NOW      Soooooooo, the bar was finally sold to someone who knows what to do. END
BEGIN NOW     The bartenders are super fast, super friendly, and always something weird, or interesting on their tv sets. END
BEGIN NOW      They have pool, playing machine, and a HUGE patio for smoking. END
BEGIN NOW      Did I already say cheap drinks?The music is a variety of rock, heavy metal, non heavy metal, and all sorts of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW       Now, hopefully your a dog lover because you might see a few dogs or cats. END
BEGIN NOW      Hard to describe the crowd, but everyone seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh, for the 3rd time, cheap drinks!!!!! Oh, they occasionally give you free pizza from next door. END
BEGIN NOW     Who cars about dog, different music, or anything else if you getting served cheap fast drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      There are 4 other bars in the area if you don't like this one. END
BEGIN NOW      Right by the grand theatre, plenty of cabs, near the bus line, so no excuse for you not to go. END
BEGIN NOW      Check it out!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW     The patio is large and dog friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Employees are nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Bouncer is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      Pinball. END
BEGIN NOW      Cool regulars to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW      The lock on the bathroom door works (hard to find at bars). END
BEGIN NOW      Free parking in a lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW     Excellent music. END
BEGIN NOW      Off the top of my head, last night I can remember hearing Faith No More, High On Fire, The Cramps, and Slayer. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender was wearing a Minor Threat shirt and they had Grindhouse playing on the TV when I walked in around 5:30. END
BEGIN NOW     It's a few doors down from Lanesplitters, who donates the delicious pizza they don't sell at the end of the night to hungry bar patrons. END
BEGIN NOW     Last time hanging out on the patio, I witnessed a Blue Heron take a GIANT crap on a couple of screaming girls. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a great place. END
BEGIN NOW     Good prices, pool table, good juke, and a PATIO! A backyard patio is so rare here in Oakland, so it scores. END
BEGIN NOW     A lot of reviewers seem to have had problems with the bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW      I haven't. END
BEGIN NOW      The crowd is cool, too. END
BEGIN NOW      Good people. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd like to have a bit more room inside, and maybe a second pool table, but other than those tiny things, this place rocks. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is pretty great. END
BEGIN NOW     The drinks are cheap here. END
BEGIN NOW      &amp; of course, like most of the dive bars -it's cash only. END
BEGIN NOW      Luckily they have a BoA and CHASE within walking distance. END
BEGIN NOW      There's also this awesome pizza place next door to go to feed your intoxicated needs. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall a great dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW     a WHOLE lot better than the Ruby Room or Radio. END
BEGIN NOW     (I think its the same owner?). END
BEGIN NOW      The backdoor patio could use a little more lighting though and that nasty lonely blue bulb should be replaced. END
BEGIN NOW     4 stars as room for growth. END
BEGIN NOW      Great little rock and roll neighborhood bar!(too clean to call it a 'dive')They've got  a pool table, a few pinball machines and one of those table ms. END
BEGIN NOW      pacmans. END
BEGIN NOW     Decor is cute, place is clean, and the jukebox is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm really excited about 2 things at this place:#1. END
BEGIN NOW      Tuesday nights. END
BEGIN NOW      (For DML)#2. END
BEGIN NOW      The back patio. END
BEGIN NOW      I can just imagine the awesomeness of meeting friends for booze brunches, or cooling off on balmy(ish) summer nights. END
BEGIN NOW     We wanted to get something to eat after the horrifying West Elm/Pottery Barn warehouse sale a couple weekends back and stumbled upon this place. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is great - a bunch of food and beverage spots all under one roof. END
BEGIN NOW      Kind of reminds me of Gotham West Market in NYC. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the pork tacos smothered in a red sauce, topped with pickled onion and cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW      The two tacos came with a side of pinto beans. END
BEGIN NOW      It was good, the pork was tender, the beans were also good. END
BEGIN NOW      I do agree with most of the other reviews on price, it is kind of steep. END
BEGIN NOW      I think it was $12/$13 for two tacos and some beans. END
BEGIN NOW      the tacos were little so I am not sure why they command such a high price. END
BEGIN NOW      But they were good! If I was in the area again, I would go back for sure. END
BEGIN NOW     A friend said yeah let's go its delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       No. END
BEGIN NOW      It's over priced mexican food that wants to be good for you. END
BEGIN NOW      I ate a torta and may never come here again unless I need to feel good about my food choices or maybe I'll get a salad or something. END
BEGIN NOW       So don't go thinking your going to have mexican food as you will be sadly mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW     Love love freakin LOVE this place! The staff are really nice, food is EXCELLENT!! Great spot to eat for lunch even dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      The tostadas on Tuesday are to die for! MUST TRY! MUST TRY! It'll never disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW      P. END
BEGIN NOW     s. END
BEGIN NOW      Pork belly tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean shut up right!. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is one of my "go-tos" for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW       I have dined here about 6 times and each time it has been really good. END
BEGIN NOW       Service is limited since its a walk up and order place; they do deliver food to the table and are super nice. END
BEGIN NOW       Its a local place in the "Swan" center with multiple eateries as well as a fish market inside. END
BEGIN NOW       Handmade tortillas and creative "cocktails" (no hard alcohol, but they do make a good "bloody" style drink with cayenne pepper crusted candy sticks (have only seen these in Mexico before). END
BEGIN NOW       Fresh, fresh, fresh!  Oh yeah, I have had pork, fish, shrimp and chicken tacos - all great!. END
BEGIN NOW     Today we got for lunch the crispy wild shrimp tacos and peach salad! Absolutely fantastic and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Although its crowded we found a table with 3 seatings right away. END
BEGIN NOW     AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything i've gotten here has been incredible and i'm a very big fan (in case you couldn't already tell) Their menu changes so there no guarantee that they will have a certain dish a given night. END
BEGIN NOW      However, I was really impressed by the tamale i had here and the chicken anchiote. END
BEGIN NOW      Comes with awesome sides of rice and beans, tortilla and everything tastes so freshly made. END
BEGIN NOW      Some could argue this place is on the pricier side compared to standard Mexican fare, but at first bite you will realize its absolutely worth it and keep coming back like i do. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha, Cosecha, Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      I have such a weird relationship with you. END
BEGIN NOW      I truly do like you, but you are expensive. END
BEGIN NOW      I recognize that quality ingredients and such tastiness do cost money. END
BEGIN NOW      But, spending $15 on 2 shrimp tacos and some beans in downtown Oakland at a pretty casual spot is insane to me?! Were those deliciously large shrimp tacos so tasty? YES, albeit a bit sloppy to eat. END
BEGIN NOW      Plump wild shrimp, tempura fried with some jalapeno on 2 corn tortillas was perfection. END
BEGIN NOW      I went the blue plate special and at $15 with beans, I was shocked. END
BEGIN NOW      I actually think I wish I bought 2 at $5. END
BEGIN NOW     50 per taco. END
BEGIN NOW      :: FRIDAYS only for those shrimp tacos, btw. END
BEGIN NOW     :: So, there, I said it. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't like dropping $15 on a casual lunch, but those shrimp tacos are so worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      I've actually dined here quite regularly for lunch since my move nearby almost a year ago and you always ignite the same reactions. END
BEGIN NOW      When I'm paying, I gulp and say: how much? But, then my food arrives and I enjoy, maybe even savor every bite and can appreciate the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      And although your portions don't seem huge, they are more than enough food and quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW      In the end, Mexican is one of those foods. END
BEGIN NOW      You expect to pay less and when you don't, you're like, excuse me? But man, Cosecha is so tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      From their tacos, to their tortas, to their quesadillas, I've always been impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      *Seating can be a bit of pain, since this spot's located within Swan's Marketplace. END
BEGIN NOW      A co-op of sorts for local restaurants where they share the seating space. END
BEGIN NOW      Lunch time is always packed weekdays, but taking a quick glance at their Saturday brunch makes me think I've been sleeping on this spot for weekend fare. END
BEGIN NOW     * Their guac is a good, but at $5+ for a small dish, it is totally not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW     Amazing Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW      Came here for brunch on Sat (just a suggestion, come here early for brunch) and had bacon tacos with eggs and a side of beans. END
BEGIN NOW      All delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      My girlfriend had the waffles (yup, waffles at a Mexican restaurant!) and they were fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW      To round things out I had the Cosecha Margarita and it was delicious, with orange zest and real worm salt around the rim. END
BEGIN NOW      I know we're coming back for more. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha has very good Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW      It's located in a food court-esque building, with a few other restaurants that all share common seating. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend and I went in around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was bumpin. END
BEGIN NOW      We both ordered a quesadilla (I had the grilled peppers and chicken, and he had the mushroom and chicken). END
BEGIN NOW      We also shared some chips and salsa, and the iced horchata latte. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices are bit higher than some Mexican restaurants, but I think it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      I was impressed with everything. END
BEGIN NOW      I thought the horchata latte was great, and actually complemented the spiciness of the quesadilla really well. END
BEGIN NOW      The quesadilla was incredibly well prepared, and the salsa served on the side gave the quesadilla a great flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      I really liked the vibe at Cosecha, and the food was great. END
BEGIN NOW      It's definitely one of my new favorite spots in Oakland (along with Zachary's, Drake's Dealership, and OBTOWN). END
BEGIN NOW     Food = excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      Price point = poor. END
BEGIN NOW      Hence the 4 star average. END
BEGIN NOW      I loved my food but as others have mentioned, I don't think it was worth $15/plate. END
BEGIN NOW      Both my SO and I had the Grilled Chicken Anchiote. END
BEGIN NOW      It is served in a cute clay plate over rice with guacamole and a couple tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      Perhaps make the guac optional and lower the price a few bucks? The quality was great and they supposedly use fresh, seasonal/ local ingredients which always jacks up price so I get it. END
BEGIN NOW      to an extent. END
BEGIN NOW      But it's also not a sit down restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      It is cafeteria style- in a large building with other restaurants, much like San Pedro Square Market in San Jose if you've ever been. END
BEGIN NOW      Oakland is certainly stepping up it's food game and this was a great example. END
BEGIN NOW      I would recommend this place but don't expect your fav hole in the wall taqueria prices. END
BEGIN NOW     Chicken tacos are so good. END
BEGIN NOW      I want to come back to eat these!Pork belly was ok. END
BEGIN NOW      Verde mole was ok too, spiciness made up for the dull taste. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything taste so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW     Owner was super nice, bringing us our food. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything we ate was delicious and fresh!! We went during the breakfast menu tired the waffles. END
BEGIN NOW      They were stinking amazing Best waffles I ever ate!!!!! We also had the shrimp tacos also great!!! Wish they served dinner early in the morning I would like to have tired the pork tacos . END
BEGIN NOW     Decent Mexican-themed bar at Swan's Market with a modest menu, whether brunch offerings like the huevos cuaouthemoc (two eggs over beans and salsa de arbol, topped with avocado and handmade flour tortillas) or evening fare like a fresh, crispy fish taco. END
BEGIN NOW      They also offer a few nicely done drinks like their pomegranate margaritas. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, the offerings are reasonably delicious, good quality, and presented nicely, although prices are slightly on the elevated side. END
BEGIN NOW      As this is a small stand inside Swan's Market, there aren't many people working here so service may seem a bit overwhelmed or impersonal at times. END
BEGIN NOW      Nevertheless, if you are here at Swan's Market and want something more substantial than, say, sausages, this isn't a bad choice. END
BEGIN NOW     The short: delicious tacosThis is a line-up and they'll bring your order type place. END
BEGIN NOW      At lunch hour, this place is busy and the wait was around 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW      While waiting, we watched some ladies hand-make the tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      Mmmm fresh tortillas! Watch out though. END
BEGIN NOW      The tortilla chips are ultra fried and oily; I almost could feel my arteries clogging up. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered the daily special of two fish tacos (Wednesday and Thursday; Friday has shrimp tacos). END
BEGIN NOW      I enjoyed them and wished there were more than two!This place (Swan's Marketplace) is an agglomeration of other dining eateries, which makes for a loud, crowded and semi-cramped atmosphere, though the afternoon light streaming through was a nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't remember which paper or publication I first read about Cosecha (weird that it wasn't Yelp - heh), but I distinctly remember that I had to check this place out because it was Dominica Rice-Cisneros', of Chez Pannise fame, new place. END
BEGIN NOW      On my visit, I tried out two dishes: Chilaquiles and Breakfast Tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Both dishes were quite tasty, but it is definitely quality over quantity here! Cosecha sources fresh, local ingredients, so expect to pay a bit more than your regular mobile/taco truck establishment. END
BEGIN NOW      Located in the Housewives Market (Swan's), you will find Cosecha in what I describe as an upscale food court. END
BEGIN NOW      You place your order at the register, get a number and you will get your meal in around ten minutes or so. END
BEGIN NOW      This place was one that I actually went before opening due to its popularity and I had things to do. END
BEGIN NOW     like holiday shopping!There is plenty of street parking!My buddy and I when we totally beat traffic on a Saturday morning:Uh, what time is it?   Ten o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW      They open at 10:30. END

BEGIN NOW     Cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously, try the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW      Simply the best. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha is a Mexican eatery with a nouvelle California twist. END
BEGIN NOW      It's located inside old Oakland's Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW      Solid wooden benches-- amenable to communal style seating -- are set up in front of their ordering counter. END
BEGIN NOW      I actually love shared dining like this; seems only fitting for a 'market' context. END
BEGIN NOW     The open wall aspect of this market is attractive; chose to avoid the interior ceiling fans and be warmed by the direct sun. END
BEGIN NOW      People sitting outside were accompanied by their pets. END
BEGIN NOW      The ordering line took just a bit of time. END
BEGIN NOW      I loved observing the hustle and bustle of the open prep station behind the glass. END
BEGIN NOW       While waiting in line, I perused the paper menu pasted onto the glass counter. END
BEGIN NOW       I was there towards the end of weekend brunch (they close at 3:00 p. END
BEGIN NOW     m. END
BEGIN NOW     ) I ordered the wild shrimp tacos and the horchata latte, following the tip from Bon Appetit's August 2015 issue which featured Oakland dining spots including Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW       Place your order at the counter and pay, then servers bring your food out. END
BEGIN NOW       The horchata latte was sheer cinnamon-y goodness served in a tall glass-- light, sweet, and tinged with coffee tones. END
BEGIN NOW       I thought it would be the perfect non-dairy counterpoint to spicy Mexican chillies. END
BEGIN NOW       The two corn tortillas piled high with batter-fried shrimp were nicely presented. END
BEGIN NOW      The shrimp sat on shredded cabbage, were topped with a chili-infused crema sauce and garnished with jalapeno and cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos weren't spicy and the cup of beans on the side were well-flavored. END
BEGIN NOW      The shrimp were high quality and fresh with a firm bite (none of the mealy texture of aquaculture-produced shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW     ) My only gripe might be the quantity size--too small. END
BEGIN NOW       The prices will reveal that this is not another street-stall taco shop although it functions like one. END
BEGIN NOW      I paid around $15 for the gourmet, delicately flavored shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW       This place offers sufficiently unique taste that it's worth a special treat, but it wouldn't be my daily go-to, based on price alone. END
BEGIN NOW       There are plenty of more ordinary tacquerias for everyday dining. END
BEGIN NOW     I was originally attracted to this restaurant due to its iced horchata latte!  When I saw this on the menu I flipped with excitement and headed to Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW       I was expecting an conventional restaurant location, but I found myself at a food market. END
BEGIN NOW       By no means was this a bad thing, it added to the ambiance of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is on a other level, often you hear about a place and it gets so hyped up that you are extremely excited to try it and it let's you down when you finally get to try it. END
BEGIN NOW      well this is not that kind of place. END
BEGIN NOW       The flavors are stupefying!  Yes, I looked up a word to describe what I felt when I had the green pozole. END
BEGIN NOW       I returned and tried the fish tacos special and on my next visit I had the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW       Needless to say, I am a big fan of this place and it's authentic and unique spins on classic dishes. END
BEGIN NOW       Only draw back, it's on the expensive side :(. END
BEGIN NOW     Bomb tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Favorites are the pork belly and chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      Veggie is hit or miss - usually too watery. END
BEGIN NOW       Tortillas are freshly made as you wait in line. END
BEGIN NOW      Chips are greasy, crunchy, and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     This food court makes it easy to go out with coworkers when you're craving different cuisines; however, watch where you sit because vendors will get mad and yell at you to move if you sit in the wrong territory (tables are marked for specific restaurants in the shared space). END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha is so fresh. END
BEGIN NOW      From the salads to the tortillas for the tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything is made fresh to order. END
BEGIN NOW      Love it. END
BEGIN NOW     I have to say the fish tacos were heavenly. END
BEGIN NOW      I am just in Oakland for the night and looking for a cure for my jet lag. END
BEGIN NOW      Fish tacos were the blue plate special. END
BEGIN NOW      They came perfectly done - tempura style, crispy with a little bite. END
BEGIN NOW      Beans with a half an avocado came in the side. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely come back!!. END
BEGIN NOW     While having a group dinner inside the Swan Market, friends and I tried a few dishes from each of the establishments inside. END
BEGIN NOW       I thought the service at Cosecha was great and I liked the menu choices. END
BEGIN NOW       Only major gripe was the value. END
BEGIN NOW       For what we paid, I thought was a bit steep for what we actually got. END
BEGIN NOW       We even ordered the happy hour special which happened to be 2 fish tacos and a pint of beer ($12). END
BEGIN NOW       Unfortunately, the battered fish tacos were so small and didn't satisfy. END
BEGIN NOW       The tacos looked delicious, but were slightly bland. END
BEGIN NOW       They have 3 beers on tap which you can choose from including Modelo, an IPA and a chocolate stout. END
BEGIN NOW       Our group ended up getting 4 orders of the tacos/beer ($50+). END
BEGIN NOW       If you have a big appetite like me, you may end up spending more money than you anticipate at Cosecha to fill up your belly. END
BEGIN NOW       May come back, but wouldn't get the tacos next time. END
BEGIN NOW     This is the perfect place for a casual lunch or dinner date. END
BEGIN NOW      I've been here several times with my friends and always enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW      Cosecha makes anincredible selection of traditional moles utilizing authentic ingredients and old school recipes. END
BEGIN NOW      I recommend the green mole and their fish tacos to any first-time visitors or regulars that are looking for something different to try. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, if you're fan of Horchata definitely try their horchata espresso! It's my favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW     WONDERFUL!!! Best fish tacos that I have had in ages! The chips and salsa were amazing as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Good food. END
BEGIN NOW      Slight bit pricy but it is the Bay Area and it's downtown and it's quality food so it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      The pork belly tacos were good the meat was light but crispy and the salsa on those were to dye for. END
BEGIN NOW      The carne plate was delicious to real good food but dinner doesn't start until 530 so don't come earlier for that or it won't be there. END
BEGIN NOW      I got 3 plates two drinks 50 bucks easily. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been going here for a couple years now and because of my resolution to Yelp consistently I am making up for my lack of a review for Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     They have brought a nice high end twist to Mexican food and one of the first places to bring some style with substance to the Old Oakland area. END
BEGIN NOW       Since their arrival they've spurned many great eateries to open up around them. END
BEGIN NOW       Through all the change they've still stood strong with their versions of many classics. END
BEGIN NOW      Think high end taco truck without the truck. END
BEGIN NOW      The various tacos and quesadillas are the stars for me here specifically shrimp (when available) and the Mushroom quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW      They also do a mean horchatta latte if you are a horchatta fan. END
BEGIN NOW      My only gripes are that shrimp is just a special on a specific day and that prices are a little high to be a weekly regular. END
BEGIN NOW     Very limited menu. END
BEGIN NOW      One friend got the soft tacos with braised pork &amp; a side of beans. END
BEGIN NOW      Delicious, beyond fork tender. END
BEGIN NOW      Fresh, hand-made tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      This was a keeper and the highlight of our meal. END
BEGIN NOW      Another friend got the chilaquiles with salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW      Same fresh tortillas as the tacos except that they were cut into chips and fried. END
BEGIN NOW      Scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. END
BEGIN NOW      The avocado was perfectly ripe and the crema made the whole dish a luscious bite from beginning to end. END
BEGIN NOW      A good dish but after the wow factor of the braised pork, it was anticlimactic. END
BEGIN NOW      I went against the grain and got breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffle was yummy but different. END
BEGIN NOW      They pulled it from the iron before it formed a crispy crust. END
BEGIN NOW      It was light and fluffy. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior was fully cooked but it was still moist and tender. END
BEGIN NOW      I added the cajeta sauce which is a Mexican-style caramel. END
BEGIN NOW      So good, I was literally scraping the tiny container for every last drop. END
BEGIN NOW      We also got the chips, guac and salsa. END
BEGIN NOW      My advice, skip the chips that were hard and stale and substitute with the fresh tortillas instead. END
BEGIN NOW      For drinks, we sipped on strawberry limeade. END
BEGIN NOW      So yummy, I was chasing the last drop around the ice. END
BEGIN NOW      Located in the old Swan's Market, I liked the vibe of the place. END
BEGIN NOW      It reminded me of a tiny and more homey SF Ferry Building. END
BEGIN NOW      Very similar to San Jose's San Pedro Square Market. END
BEGIN NOW      If Cosecha isn't your style, there were about 4 other stalls including one featuring Japanese food and another serving hot dogs and beer. END
BEGIN NOW      There was also a wine merchant. END
BEGIN NOW      I wish I had a cooler. END
BEGIN NOW      There was a butcher and a fishmonger offering raw product for purchase. END
BEGIN NOW      About 3 blocks from the 12th St. END
BEGIN NOW      Bart station, it easy to get to. END
BEGIN NOW      I will be back. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the most expensive shrimp taco here. END
BEGIN NOW      And it was basically one shrimp and one taco! Over 5bucks after tax. END
BEGIN NOW      I was still hungry afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW     one of my favorites!i've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of my experiences were great. END
BEGIN NOW      the waffle at breakfast, the delicious pico and guacamole, the horchata latte. END
BEGIN NOW     all so delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW     Did someone say vegan quesadillas and strawberry margaritas? If so, I'm all in!I love how Cosecha uses sweet potato in their vegan quesadillas rather than using some fake rubbery cheese substitute. END
BEGIN NOW      They also do not skimp on the guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW      You get some inside the quesadilla itself and some on the side along with a deliciously spicy salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW      You can also choose from mushrooms, green chile, etc to go inside your quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW     The kicker to this meal though, was the asparagus and braised chickpeas. END
BEGIN NOW      It might have been a special, but if you see it on the menu, do not hesitate and order it! The chubbiest asparagus I had ever seen, topped with perfect chickpeas in a really rich saucy broth. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll be dreaming about this asparagus for eternity. END
BEGIN NOW     My strawberry margarita was also memorable. END
BEGIN NOW      It wasn't overly sweet and actually tasted like limes and real strawberries rather than the artificial syrupy stuff. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all, I really enjoyed my meal here at Cosecha from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW      I can't wait to try other menu items!. END
BEGIN NOW     In the search of good Mexican food we wanted to love this place, and were really disappointed! We saw this place on KQED and decided to give it a try. END
BEGIN NOW      We were there on a Wednesday around 5, restaurant was pretty empty, no excuse for what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW     Here are my complaints:1. END
BEGIN NOW      PRICES: They are way out of line for counter service &amp; communal seating: $13 for two tiny fish tacos, $15 for Pork Adobado plate, $3 for chips salsa and guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW      There are far better taco places (such as Tracy DeJardin's place in the SF Ferry Building) which are MUCH less expensive, better quality2. END
BEGIN NOW      QUALITY: The food was not prepared well. END
BEGIN NOW      Rice was gummy and EVERYTHING was super greasy. END
BEGIN NOW      The chips and fish tacos were literally swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW      No one drained a damn thing. END
BEGIN NOW      Fish tacos were very smelly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Probably should not have eaten them. END
BEGIN NOW      Pork plate was missing avocado and had a few pieces of gross, shriveled zucchini on the side. END
BEGIN NOW      Very unappetizing. END
BEGIN NOW     3. END
BEGIN NOW      PORTIONS: Chip order was sad. END
BEGIN NOW      With only a few cold greasy chips. END
BEGIN NOW      Skimpy on the salsa as well. END
BEGIN NOW      Fish tacos were absolutely tiny and each plated on one small tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW      WAY too expensive for portion size. END
BEGIN NOW      Pork plate had two tiny tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     4. END
BEGIN NOW      SERVICE: Worker at the counter was barely civil. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked for extra tortillas with our pork plate, forgot them. END
BEGIN NOW      Ticket was cooked wrong- one order came out far in advance of the other. END
BEGIN NOW      The counter worker slammed down the pork plate about a mile away (we were sitting on a big communal table) from us. END
BEGIN NOW      Very abrupt and rude. END
BEGIN NOW     ***I suspect the owner was absent and it showed. END
BEGIN NOW      Place is run poorly! Not a good experience, we will not go back. END
BEGIN NOW     ***. END
BEGIN NOW     We tried their duck special on the weekend and the food was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The dishes are well prepared and the portion sizes were decent. END
BEGIN NOW      They are trying to add a high end twist to their food. END
BEGIN NOW      Their corn tortillas are very good, I think it is freshly made on site very day. END
BEGIN NOW      It is a food court style dining in Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      The dining was casual and we could get beer and other food from the other eateries in the food court. END
BEGIN NOW     I noticed many of the other customers getting their wild shrimp taco specials. END
BEGIN NOW      We will try that when we go their next time. END
BEGIN NOW      We did not know this place until we saw them on KQED - Check Please Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW     The owner greets you right away and everything is fresh. END
BEGIN NOW      I had a mushroom and cheese quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW      It tasted so fresh!! The next day I had the shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      The best I have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW      Can't wait to return. END
BEGIN NOW     It's sad that it's come to this. END
BEGIN NOW      I used to love this place but it seems that in all the trendy-ness and influx of consumers in Oakland, people have just forgotten about customer service. END
BEGIN NOW      In the past I have enjoyed certain dishes from Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      (You have to know what to order here, as their meats can be dry, making certain dishes way overpriced) And usually the service is pretty good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW      My last visit, however, was very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW      The line (which can get long here) wasn't, thankfully and I tried to place my order but before I could do so the owner (the female) called the guy at the register away. END
BEGIN NOW      He was nice about it at first and said he would be right back. END
BEGIN NOW      The owner was giving him instructions which was fine but as he kept trying to come back to me to take my order, she kept pulling him away (keep in mind that she was facing me and fully aware that there was a customer waiting the entire time) until he finally came back to me and said "we are too busy, I have to go help in the back and I can't take your order". END
BEGIN NOW      Are you serious right now? How unprofessional and rude to keep a customer waiting and then ultimately TURN THEM AWAY?!? Get your act together. END
BEGIN NOW     What first called my attention to this restaurant was this Facebook post: facebook. END
BEGIN NOW     com/permalink. END
BEGIN NOW     p…They were obviously more than just a restaurant; they realized the impact of our everyday interactions and are helping taking responsibility as a community towards real change. END
BEGIN NOW      So last week when BART went down halfway through my commute home, my husband had to come pick me up from Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      We decided to have dinner in the area and came here. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm so glad we did! My husband and I split an order of shrimp tacos and carne adobada. END
BEGIN NOW      It was delicious and the meat was very tender. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm also not big on beans but OMG I ate em' up here! Also, homemade tortillas are never a bad idea. END
BEGIN NOW      My 6 year olds had a chicken quesadilla with rice &amp; beans and drank horchata. END
BEGIN NOW      They loved it! Very good food and excellent service. END
BEGIN NOW      I also love the idea that this place is a bit pricey (hear me out!) It's always bothered me so much that people just assume Mexican food has to cheap. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, taco trucks are great and nobody gets mad at a cheap meal but Mexican food can be just as fancy-pants as the rest of ya. END
BEGIN NOW     Today was my first time trying Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the special which was 2 crispy fish tacos and beans with avocado for $11. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was awesome! It is a bit pricey, so I don't think I will be eating here very often, but it was good food and Steve Kerr and his crew showed up and everyone was clapping. END
BEGIN NOW      So for that reason, I will give this place another star. END
BEGIN NOW      LOL. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish taco special is a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW       Can get better fry and quality at Rubios. END
BEGIN NOW      The fry was decent but the fish was whatever. END
BEGIN NOW       The torta made bread soggy, the meat was weak. END
BEGIN NOW       Overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW      Customer service is rude. END
BEGIN NOW     Definitely a great Mexican food restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      Their menu changes, which keeps things interesting. END
BEGIN NOW      I actually did take out one night and got the mushroom quesadilla and grilled chicken quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW      They were both very flavorful and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Portion size is reasonable for the price. END
BEGIN NOW      I especially liked that they used corn tortilla for the quesadillas. END
BEGIN NOW      I also ordered their chips, which I thought were well salted (which I like) but drenched in grease. END
BEGIN NOW      They were too greasy for me, but I still managed to finish most of them! Also the service was great. END
BEGIN NOW      The person was friendly and helpful on the phone, even though I couldn't decide what to order. END
BEGIN NOW      I picked up my order with no problems! Great experience, will come back to try all of their tacos next!. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm basing this review on food quality as well as service. END
BEGIN NOW       It was a miscommunication on their part which delayed our order. END
BEGIN NOW      My co-worker and I ordered shrimp tacos and honestly they tasted like shrimp donuts. END
BEGIN NOW      We didn't enjoy the batter and there was not enough sauce on the tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      The overall dish it was lacking flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      Next time I'm going to Belly's for shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Problem solved. END
BEGIN NOW     WOW. END
BEGIN NOW      The food here is incredible!  The selection is very limited (4-5 items on the menu), but we tried the tacos and quesadilla, and they were both amazing!!!  The meats were moist, tender and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW       The sauces were perfect. END
BEGIN NOW       The tortillas were warm and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     This is food court style dining, with an option to purchase beer from one of the other eateries. END
BEGIN NOW       Super casual, you order at the counter and they bring it to you. END
BEGIN NOW      Very delicous. END
BEGIN NOW      I can't wait to come back again!. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm going to eat here again because I only had the totopos but they were great. END
BEGIN NOW      I wanted to try more stuff, but we were doing a day drinking order a bunch of stuff thing so this seemed the most appropriate. END
BEGIN NOW     One of my favorite places to eat in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW      They have delicious food that tastes homemade. END
BEGIN NOW      I love their yam/mushroom quesadillas and their seasonal fruit salad with cucumber, pumpkin seeds, jicama, and citrus vin. END
BEGIN NOW     I was here for a business lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu is a little pricey but the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW      To be honest, chips and salsa with guac being close to $6 was a little  excessive. END
BEGIN NOW      The fish tacos, however were worth the cost. END
BEGIN NOW      They tasted great, the fish was fresh, and the plating was pleasing. END
BEGIN NOW      Surprisingly, I was full after the fish tacos even though the portion looked small. END
BEGIN NOW     This was my destination food stand for a while (before the influx of B-Dama, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     ) at Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW      Focus on organic (when possible) ingredients and limited but well executed menu. END
BEGIN NOW      We've brought friends here (HS &amp; MD) who really enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW      J typically gets the tacos, guac + chips. END
BEGIN NOW      Initially, I enjoyed their vegan tacos (been eating here since 2011), but alas, since then, I have noticed more and more salt. END
BEGIN NOW      For the average person who is not sensitive to salt, I would recommend Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW     Went for the New Year's Brunch today!Great food, but their concept of pay, get a number and the food is delivered is not working. END
BEGIN NOW       One of us got their food and the other had to wait a long time for their food. END
BEGIN NOW     We originally chose this restaurant because they were one of the few in downtown Oakland that had outdoor seating for dinner and we had our dog with us. END
BEGIN NOW     Necessity soon turned into luck Sharee as we hungrily dove into fresh vegetables and equally fresh meats. END
BEGIN NOW      My favorite meal was the blood orange salad with grilled chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      It was the perfect mix of flavors with toasted pumpkin seeds butter lettuce and a fresh citrus vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW      Portions are not too large (as I prefer), and prices represent the gentrification occurring in the bay area but still reasonable for the quality of food provided. END
BEGIN NOW     Great spot for post happy hour drunken eats. END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered the fish tacos, which are excellent, although steep at 13 pesos. END
BEGIN NOW       You basically only get two small fish tacos as well as some rice and beans. END
BEGIN NOW       The service was also pretty slow, it seems they only had one guy running back and forth taking orders at the register and waitering food out to diners. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is always good, but the prices or service are never consistent. END
BEGIN NOW      I paid about 5$ for a meal one day and the next was charged 8$. END
BEGIN NOW      Sometimes they are polite and other days incredibly rude. END
BEGIN NOW     I fell for the ratings. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the fish tacos and if it weren't for the pickled onions and dressing, they would have been plain and boring. END
BEGIN NOW      I was not too pleased. END
BEGIN NOW      Previous commenter called it a"yuppie" Mexican place, I agree. END
BEGIN NOW      Beans and rice were good, service was not so good. END
BEGIN NOW      Be prepared to hunt for napkins, sugar for tea, and a fork in different places. END
BEGIN NOW      Chips were real greasy and stuck together, but salsa was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      I should have tried the other places around here. END
BEGIN NOW      I was really craving authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW      Not the place. END
BEGIN NOW      I must have just ordered the wrong thing. END
BEGIN NOW      So disappointed :-(. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here twice now and was very impressed both times. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly employees, the homemade chips and guacamole are great, as is everything else. END
BEGIN NOW      The overall atmosphere is very friendly as well. END
BEGIN NOW     This shared restaurant space is creative and interesting--kind of like a very upscale food court. END
BEGIN NOW      Food itself is super delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't usually associate Mexican cuisine with haute cuisine--I'm a cheap taco loving girl, after all, but if you're going to do Mexican with fancy ingredients, these guys do it exceptionally well. END
BEGIN NOW      All dishes were delicious and freshly cook. END
BEGIN NOW      Sangria was good, too. END
BEGIN NOW     Massively overpriced and small portions. END
BEGIN NOW      I had two small fish tacos, rice and chips for $20. END
BEGIN NOW      This would cost $10 anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW      Disappointing ripoff. END
BEGIN NOW     The torta is good. END
BEGIN NOW      I have been here several times but today was different. END
BEGIN NOW     I experienced the worst, absolute, worst service I have ever experienced in my life. END
BEGIN NOW      The lady at the register and the owner were ridiculously rude. END
BEGIN NOW      I was surprised at first because the owner is usually smiling, and for the most part, you don't run into issues at the register (register lady is rarely friendly). END
BEGIN NOW      She said I placed the incorrect order over the phone and I'm responsible for paying it (4x the cost of what I ordered). END
BEGIN NOW      This went back and forth for a minute until she finally charged me for the correct order. END
BEGIN NOW      As I was signing the receipt, she told me to never place these small orders over the phone and that they are doing me a favor for this one mistake I made. END
BEGIN NOW      I responded with, "this is bullshit. END
BEGIN NOW     " Both the cashier and owner, became increasingly rude, and at this point, had an aggressive and hostile tone and told me this is my fault. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm a native English speaker with a law degree. END
BEGIN NOW      The cashier has a thick Mexican accent. END
BEGIN NOW      I also had the phone on speaker, with one other person sitting with me (she ordered B-Dama's pork cutlet), when I placed the phone order. END
BEGIN NOW      This order was just for me. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm damn sure I didn't make a mistake. END
BEGIN NOW       She told me to get out, to get out of a DAMN food court. END
BEGIN NOW      I think this is a part of a bigger problem, a growing service culture of attitude and arrogance in Oakland and you're starting to see it in SF. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not sure what is causing the growth of a terrible service culture. END
BEGIN NOW      It is a culture that lacks accountability, responsibility, and respect. END
BEGIN NOW      As a restaurant, you live and die by your patrons. END
BEGIN NOW      Each patron is an asset, extremely valuable, and deserving of respect. END
BEGIN NOW      Sure, every restaurant runs into their troll or exceptionally rude customer, but even in this situation, it makes more business sense to take the high road and appease the customer. END
BEGIN NOW      Who knows? maybe this growing attitude in the service culture is a response to Yelp, online trolls, and people constantly sh!&amp;&amp;ing on restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW      Whatever it is, you should never act the way this owner and cashier acted toward me-- irresponsible, immature, condescending, defensive, and hostile. END
BEGIN NOW     While I will never say their tortas are bad because that would be lying, I actually think they are pretty damn good, I will never spend a dollar at a place that lacks the proper decorum. END
BEGIN NOW     Delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW       Just had a quesadilla and pozole. END
BEGIN NOW       So good!  Will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Got the huevos cuauhtemoc, breakfast tacos, iced horchata latte, and a mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW      The homemade tortillas make this place. END
BEGIN NOW      HOWEVER, the price and limited seating puts a damper on the experience. END
BEGIN NOW      A great place to try, but doubt becoming a regular. END
BEGIN NOW     We dined on the Saturday specials. END
BEGIN NOW       Chilaquiles, one with a smokey salsa Rojo and one with Verde both were well prepared and tasty as were the Wild shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything was very fresh and made to order. END
BEGIN NOW       They have a good selection of beer &amp; wine. END
BEGIN NOW      It is located in the historic Swan Market building &amp; shares an open dining area with another restaurant &amp; a bar. END
BEGIN NOW       You order, find a table and they deliver to your table. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a lovely fall day and they open the doors and had tables on the sidewalk in addition to the dining hall. END
BEGIN NOW      It is kid friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Yesterday was the second time that I ate at Cosecha, and we came specifically for the Chicken Mole Verde blue plate special that is available on Mondays. END
BEGIN NOW     The first time I had tried Cosecha was on a Friday night when they were featuring Wild Shrimp Tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      They were incredible. END
BEGIN NOW     To me, it is hard to find a fabulous Mexican food/restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      A Mexican restaurant that doesn't put a fusion twist on it, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for ordinary. END
BEGIN NOW      You can find ordinary almost anywhere in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW      It's usually always the same. END
BEGIN NOW      My best friend growing up was first generation Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW      The family would get together and cook big regional meals from old family recipes. END
BEGIN NOW      Out of the ordinary, but not necessarily worthy of the hype everyone tends to give for something "out of the ordinary", but it allowed for me to be exposed to really GOOD, "non-traditional" Mexican food at a young age. END
BEGIN NOW     I LOVE Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      I love that they don't have a huge 3 page menu. END
BEGIN NOW      I love that their food is incredibly fresh. END
BEGIN NOW      I love how clean their kitchen appears to be. END
BEGIN NOW      and I love that you can see part of their cooking process. END
BEGIN NOW      Good wait staff too!The food here is like eating someone's secret recipes. END
BEGIN NOW       The food has a "slight" twist to the ordinary, and almost akin to eating in someone's family home. END
BEGIN NOW     The Chicken Mole Verde was fantastic (not your typical mole sauce made with chocolate). END
BEGIN NOW      Consecha's sauce had a little bit of bite/heat to it, but it was spicy without burning your mouth, and without lasting effect. END
BEGIN NOW      So pleasant to eat! To top it off, the chicken was nicely shredded and topped off with roasted pumpkin seeds, and a few slices of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW      The beans. END
BEGIN NOW     not your refried variety, were cooked to the right consistency, not overcooked and falling apart and nicely flavored, as was the rice which also was not your typical Mexican rice. END
BEGIN NOW      It was white rice, though it did not taste like plain white rice. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm sure that also had a secret ingredient. END
BEGIN NOW      Served with warm corn tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     Did I mention that Cosecha has absolutely the best Horchata that I have ever had? It's not thick, it's not watery, it has a hint of cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW      I would like a glass of it every single day! Very refreshing during warm weather too. END
BEGIN NOW     The food presentation is lovely and equal to any upscale restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      Each blue plate special had a nice cloth under each plate. END
BEGIN NOW      The plates themselves were very nice earthenware. END
BEGIN NOW      I just can't say enough about the entire experience. END
BEGIN NOW     As others have said, Cosecha is in the old Swann's marketplace and is more like an open air food court. END
BEGIN NOW       You place your order at the counter, and they bring it to your table. END
BEGIN NOW      If you are hooked on burritos at Chipotle, I would not suggest you go here. END
BEGIN NOW       If you are looking for really good, out of the ordinary, quality Mexican food with that "slight" twist, this is the place for you. END
BEGIN NOW      Not cheap, but not expensive for what you get. END
BEGIN NOW      P. END
BEGIN NOW     S. END
BEGIN NOW       The food portions are perfect, but not "super sized". END
BEGIN NOW       If you are a big eater, you may want to get an appetizer. END
BEGIN NOW     Can't wait to go back!. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha is pretty good and I have only been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW      Most recently for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I got the Chilaquiles and we split the waffle. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffle was like butta! The Chilaquiles were really good, but couldn't eat the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW      It's on the pricer side, but good nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was delicious!!! Ordered the quesadilla with peppers and braised pork. END
BEGIN NOW      The tortilla was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      It tasted freshly made. END
BEGIN NOW      The pork was tender. END
BEGIN NOW      It looked small when they brought it out but it was quite filling!! Pomegranate margarita was pretty good, a bit strong. END
BEGIN NOW      The horchata latte looked good will def try that next time. END
BEGIN NOW     Fantastic place! Cosheca is honestly the reason I even started writing yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the pleasure of trying their fish tacos, which were so fresh and had incredible flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      The pinto beans really sealed the deal for me as they had just the perfect amount of seasoning and texture and really complimented the dish. END
BEGIN NOW      Also tried their horchatta latte, which was simply genius. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was very efficient and friendly and my food arrived promptly after ordering. END
BEGIN NOW      I cannot recommend Cosecha enough! Already craving their fish tacos as I write this review. END
BEGIN NOW     Ok those shrimp tacos on Friday are LEGIT. END
BEGIN NOW      We went other times and food was good but didn't knock my socks off. END
BEGIN NOW      We WILL be back for these tacos ASAP!. END
BEGIN NOW     Came on a Saturday for take out brunch. END
BEGIN NOW       Had the wild shrimp tacos, strawberry lime drink. END
BEGIN NOW       Amazing!  Even more so was the fact that I got a free chocolate chip cookie. END
BEGIN NOW      All was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     contemplating going back for more!  Definitely my new go to for brunch in Old Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been on the hunt for really good Mexican food since moving to the bay area - living in San Diego (aka, California's Best Border Town) spoiled me rotten. END
BEGIN NOW      There I was treated to the best guacamole and fish tacos north of Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW      When I heard about Cosecha, I was over the moon. END
BEGIN NOW      but while my high expectations probably weren't very helpful, this was definitely not a 5-star experience. END
BEGIN NOW      The restaurant is buried in a warehouse maze - an interesting space, just a liiiiittle hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW      We had a table reserved, thanks to a friend who plans ahead - but there was no one available to ask about said table. END
BEGIN NOW      There was 1 server running around like a madwoman, and 1 guy at the cash register taking/filling orders, but no one else. END
BEGIN NOW      People were wandering around uncertain as to whether they should seat themselves or wait to be seated. END
BEGIN NOW      we finally went to the wine store next door (which has no door/sign/anything marking it as a separate entity) hoping to get our questions answers. END
BEGIN NOW      The place just seemed completely disorganized. END
BEGIN NOW     So here's how it works! It's family-style self-seating at long picnic tables, unless you make a reservation, and then you can get a private table in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      If you wait for a server to seat you or come to your table, you'll wait forever - order at the front counter, by the register. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu &amp; specials are listed on a chalkboard on the wall, but beware: we'd come for the night's special, wild shrimp tacos, but they were sold out by 6pm. END
BEGIN NOW      We were baffled - it was early and the place wasn't even crowded. END
BEGIN NOW      Not cool to sell out of your Dinner Special at the beginning of dinnertime. END
BEGIN NOW      They also need more staff on the floor - for 40 minutes we had water but no glasses. END
BEGIN NOW      Which went well with our chicken/pork tortillas that were missing tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was good - the kind of good you're psyched to eat, but not the kind of good you'd return for. END
BEGIN NOW      We tried the grilled chicken achiote - chicken marinated in achiote with rice, beans &amp; handmade tortillas, and the carne adovada - braised pork with chile guajillo, beans, rice &amp; tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      Really good guacamole!! The tortillas were handmade and delicious; the rest of the dish was fresh but unremarkable. END
BEGIN NOW      The people who work here are incredibly nice - but they're also really overwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe now that Cosecha is so popular, they'll make it more user friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     ?. END
BEGIN NOW     Mmmmm!!! Pork belly taco. END
BEGIN NOW      Never had anything like that before. END
BEGIN NOW      You probably think I'm crazy but it had a savory cotton candy like taste. END
BEGIN NOW      Awesome haha. END
BEGIN NOW      The horchata was a little gritty. END
BEGIN NOW      The chicken taco also had amazing flavor and was very tender. END
BEGIN NOW     Food court dinning with excellent Mexican food at a moderate price. END
BEGIN NOW       All of the salads are quite nice as well as the Carnitas and tacos. END
BEGIN NOW       It is great on Fridays when the Farmer's market is open. END
BEGIN NOW     Staying in downtown Oakland, we checked out Yelp for a good place for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      Interestingly, on Saturday night, not to many restaurants seem to be open in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW      We found this place interesting per the description, plus it wasn't far from our hotel. END
BEGIN NOW     It's an interesting concept for a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      Only a limited menu but the restaurant is more like an upscale cafe stall. END
BEGIN NOW      It's in conjuction with several other similar eateries each having different types of food, like pizza, oysters, all with a common eating  area between them. END
BEGIN NOW       We had the quesadillas and also ordered a margherita  pizza from the pizza stall. END
BEGIN NOW      Very tasty food!! I would have given 4/5 stars, but the portions were really small for the prices paid. END
BEGIN NOW     We're all surely spoiled with the great eats at Swan's Marketplace - my usual entry point is through Rosamunde and I've never quite made it far enough to get to Cosecha - fortunately I went on a Monday when things are just a bit more mellow and conducive to browsing. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried the pork torta with what appeared to be twice fried tortilla chips (no complaints there) and fresh guac - the food was exactly what I was hoping for and the portions were fair. END
BEGIN NOW       Now, spending $17 on a torta, chips &amp; a sparking water is definitely excessive and arguably insane but Cosecha isn't the odd ball when it comes to the modern urban lunch pricing that is nearing $20/person so it's hard to hold that against them. END
BEGIN NOW     The menu is simple and from the looks of the other patrons plates all of the various dishes are a hit - definitely worth a shot. END
BEGIN NOW     especially if you're in the mood for Cholita Linda style food on a Monday (they're closed). END
BEGIN NOW     Simple, and súper delicioso! Had the Blue Plate fish tacos and both my parents - who are hard to please- loved them! Also, the small black bean soup is savory and light. END
BEGIN NOW      We topped it off with the cucumber-lime drink which was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW      Tan delicioso que ni siquiera podimos tomar foto de la comida comimos tan rápido!. END
BEGIN NOW     I can't possibly express how much I love Cosecha, or Swans Market Place as a matter of fact. END
BEGIN NOW      The market never disappoints, and I never had anything I didn't love at Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      We started with salsa and guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW      We could tell the salsa was fresh and made with heirloom tomatoes from the color of it. END
BEGIN NOW      The flavor of the salsa was vibrant and the guacamole was fresh and perfectly seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW      Then we had the fish taco and pork belly taco. END
BEGIN NOW      The fish was fresh, with nice and crispy flaky batter. END
BEGIN NOW       Pork belly was juicy on the inside and nicely charred on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW      And oh my god, the chocolate chip cookie! So good!. END
BEGIN NOW     The food may be ok but the organization and service are terrible. END
BEGIN NOW      The help is incompetent and indifferent. END
BEGIN NOW      Our most recent experience had them losing our order after we paid, and they didn't even have a record of it, and they hadn't given us a receipt. END
BEGIN NOW      After over 40 minutes of waiting for our order, and being repeatedly told, It's coming right up. END
BEGIN NOW      They conceded they hadn't placed our order and didn't even know what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW      We asked that they just give us what was available but that wasn't acceptable, so we would have to wait another 40 minutes to try again. END
BEGIN NOW      So about then we demanded our money back and left. END
BEGIN NOW      Previously we had asked a server to clean our table because it was cluttered and dirty from the previous diners. END
BEGIN NOW      One young man took part of their junk, didn't wipe the table and never came back. END
BEGIN NOW      We asked two more times before someone was willing to give us a clean table. END
BEGIN NOW     Blue plate fish tacos are a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW       Quality was fine, but you pay close to $13 for two tiny tacos that are smaller than an appetizer anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW       Chips and salsa are not even included. END
BEGIN NOW      I won't be coming here again. END
BEGIN NOW     I think they've done away with the $10 minimum on credit/debit cards? I came back here the other day with a major craving for their veggie torta, and they accepted my debit card. END
BEGIN NOW      Yay!. END
BEGIN NOW     Oakland is definitely up and coming and this market is apart of the gentrification process. END
BEGIN NOW       This place has a wine bar and they are installing some other restaurants to make it into a modern food court cooperative. END
BEGIN NOW       The lamb and beans were good, pork tacos were EXCELLENT (YOU MUST TRY) and the crab ceviche was ok. END
BEGIN NOW       The blood orange, pine nuts, and chicken salad was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the special hibiscus tequila cocktail and it was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW       I appreciate everything is made from scratch!The service is quick and efficient. END
BEGIN NOW       Erico was really nice, not to mention extremely cute and charming. END
BEGIN NOW       This place closes at 9:30 p. END
BEGIN NOW     m. END
BEGIN NOW      Friday night so make sure you come early enough time to talk, eat and drink!  Parking was easy on 9th street. END
BEGIN NOW     Honest, solid, yummy Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW      High quality meats really pack the punch in flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      Generally not a huge pork belly fan, but the pork belly tacos were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The braised beef tacos I loved even more. END
BEGIN NOW      Quesadillas were outstanding! Thick, scrumptious cheeses and vegetables sandwiched between homemade, rich, flavorful tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      House made chips and guacamole really sealed the deal for me. END
BEGIN NOW      Do yourself a favor and have a Mexican mocha. END
BEGIN NOW      or two! Sooo good! Not a fan of sweet coffee? The horchata iced latte is delightful. END
BEGIN NOW      A must have to complete the Cosecha experience!. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been back to this place 2 weekends in a row now b/c right around Friday night at 7:30, I start dreaming about those cornmeal waffles that they only make on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW       $12 for a waffle isn't cheap (includes fruit + cream), but why budget your cravings?I've also had the Pozoles which is nice and spicy and good on a chilly cloudy day. END
BEGIN NOW      Have also enjoyed the shrimp tacos, the mushroom quesadillas and the pork tacos - all are decent (but not exceptionally better than what I might find at my local taco trucks), but the waffles - that's what I come here for. END
BEGIN NOW     Unfortunately, for my first try at Cosescha the chef must have been out for the day. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the special of the day, to-go after a long day. END
BEGIN NOW      I got home and excitedly opened my dinner only to be greeted by a sad, sad little flake of fish with only a wilted piece of lettuce and a few slices of peppers. END
BEGIN NOW      It actually prompted me to take my first yelp picture it was so pathetic. END
BEGIN NOW      To add insult to injury, I now have to go back out to grab a real dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      I should have checked the box so I could have rectified on the spot, but the reviews gave me the sense that I was in good hands. END
BEGIN NOW     The last time we ate here they weren't officially open for dinners and we got in by sending an email and getting into one of their community dinners. END
BEGIN NOW      We had a great meal and sat at a community table next to this really nice couple who were just starting their catering business while still working full time at their day jobs. END
BEGIN NOW       Fast forward to now. END
BEGIN NOW     their business has taken off (S+S Gastro Grub). END
BEGIN NOW     and we finally get a chance to use them for an upcoming company holiday party!  I tell this part because you can never underestimate the power of the community table in a town like Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     and Cosecha gave us a warm and fuzzy feeling from the very beginning. END
BEGIN NOW     Stopped in with daughter for a wonderful lunch today. END
BEGIN NOW       One bite of the yam quesadilla and I couldn't stop talking about it. END
BEGIN NOW       Just tasted so "real. END
BEGIN NOW     " The tortilla was flavorful and the whole thing didn't need the sauces that came with it on the side. END
BEGIN NOW      Daughter had the queso fundido and the pozole and liked them both. END
BEGIN NOW      We also had the horchata which was very good. END
BEGIN NOW     I timed it badly that I came on a Monday, because there are no seafood taco offerings on Mondays. END
BEGIN NOW      It would be nice to always have fish tacos on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     but maybe that's fine, as then I wouldn't have tried the yam quesadilla!  Lovely atmosphere and super friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      We'll be back sooner this time!. END
BEGIN NOW     Jackpot. END
BEGIN NOW       Blue Plate Special - fish tacos, with beans and avocado garnish. END
BEGIN NOW      Twelve bucks. END
BEGIN NOW       Superb. END
BEGIN NOW      Crisp, flaky fry outside and soft, luscious fish inside. END
BEGIN NOW      The beans were so savory. END
BEGIN NOW      This happening joint is in a big warehouse filled with other places doibg the same deal. END
BEGIN NOW      Large tables are available allowing people to meet and mingle. END
BEGIN NOW      Water is on all the tables. END
BEGIN NOW        So groovy!. END
BEGIN NOW     I wanted a meal, not an overpriced "quick snack. END
BEGIN NOW     " Two little shrimp tacos for fifteen bucks? No gracias. END
BEGIN NOW      It wasn't quick either. END
BEGIN NOW      Left annoyed and hungry--won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW     I came on a Thursday hoping to get my fish taco fix but was sadly disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      How are two very small tacos with a side of plain ol' rice and black beans supposed to fill you up for $13? Topping the fish tacos were large pieces of jalapeño which overpowered what little fish I ate. END
BEGIN NOW      In addition we got an order of tortilla chips and salsa. END
BEGIN NOW      The chips were extremely oily and the salsa came in a small container which we had to ask for a second filling because we were hungry still. END
BEGIN NOW      I do like the market but don't think I'll be ordering from here again. END
BEGIN NOW     Fancy, super hip, beautifully presented "Meso- American" twist on Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW      Familiar and surprising at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW      Sangria was excellent!!! Pico de gallo was exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW      Located in middle of downtown with lots of access to drinks or dancing afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW      Portions are medium/small and prices are moderate/high- don't arrive starving. END
BEGIN NOW      Would definitely stop by again for a pre-drinks fancy snack. END
BEGIN NOW     Its pricey, but this place has the best food i have ever had. END
BEGIN NOW      Especially the pork in the pork belly tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      Soo perfect. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here a few times and am every time so impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      The ingredients are absolutely as fresh, seasonal, and creative as they claim, and the execution of flavors is clearly well-conceived. END
BEGIN NOW      This place would be easy to miss, so if you're in the area and love delicious, thoughtful, and bold Mexican food, don't miss Cosecha!. END
BEGIN NOW     Best zucchini tacos I ever ate!  Guacamole was amazing, too. END
BEGIN NOW     1. END
BEGIN NOW      I want to marry the chef2. END
BEGIN NOW      Best chocolate chip cookie outside of the ones my mom made when I was growing up. END
BEGIN NOW      3. END
BEGIN NOW      Get the corn - it will make you want to (see #1). END
BEGIN NOW     Amazing atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      In a busy area of Oakland you can find this precious food court that has a home feeling. END
BEGIN NOW      And Cosecha seriously serves you real Mexican food topped with elegant balance of flavors, also thanks to Dominica ( Chez Panisse for years ). END
BEGIN NOW     I was walking to my car after lunch and looked to see what Cosecha's daily special was and saw Mole Verde con Pollo. END
BEGIN NOW      There's always room for another taco right? $3. END
BEGIN NOW     97 including tax. END
BEGIN NOW     They've reduced the diameter of their handmade taco tortillas with the same amount of meats &amp; sauce making a much better balance between fillings &amp; tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      The taco comes topped with fresh white onions and pepitas (and usually cilantro yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/bGc4…). END
BEGIN NOW     Tender and moist (poached?) chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      The mole is lightly rich and mildly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW      They've had different moles for the Monday Chicken Mole special so call ahead, if you're looking for a specific type (Negro, Poblano, Verde, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     ). END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously? Don't knowI don't know what the big deal is. END
BEGIN NOW      Fish tacos were ok. END
BEGIN NOW      Nicely deep fried fish sitting on a piece of lettuce, sitting on corn tortilla with some aioli dripped on it. END
BEGIN NOW      Unremarkable. END
BEGIN NOW      Chicken tacos less remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW      They did not have the quesadillas available (half the menu). END
BEGIN NOW         Horchata the sweetest I've ever tasted which, for me, not a plus. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered chips and salsa and got 10 stale chips and 1 tablespoon of salsa. END
BEGIN NOW      Go to the Tacos El Gordo taco truck on International in Oakland for much better food at 1/4 the price!. END
BEGIN NOW     Had the fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      They were decent but not worth the price. END
BEGIN NOW      Portions are small, service was disinterested at best. END
BEGIN NOW      Cool spot though, lots of potential. END
BEGIN NOW     Holy frijol, Cosecha is delicious!I usually find fancier Mexican food to be suspect, but hey, I don't see any taco trucks in Downtown Oakland, and Cosecha has rave reviews. END
BEGIN NOW      This hesitation was before I knew that they have butternut squash quesadillas. END
BEGIN NOW      Had I known I would have made like a jumping bean and come pronto. END
BEGIN NOW      This butternut squash quesadilla is amazing-and you have the option of adding meat or keeping it vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW      The carnivore prevailed and their delicious grilled chicken was added. END
BEGIN NOW      That Oaxacan cheese is a lipid lovers dream-so good. END
BEGIN NOW       Their tacos I had on my second visit didn't dazzle me, but not much would after trying my drug of choice, the bnsquash quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW      I could definitely taste that the housemade tortilla and meats were quality, though. END
BEGIN NOW      Love the open air space, friendly service (the owner gave me a free oatmeal cookie hotouttadaoven), and boon to one of Oakland's most picturesque blocks. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll definitely be back to reap what Cosecha is sowing. END
BEGIN NOW     No stars the food was horrible. END
BEGIN NOW       The quesadillas were disgusting &amp; bland. END
BEGIN NOW       I tired to change my order they refused to give me another plate &amp; give me my money back. END
BEGIN NOW        She said that the shrimp was to expensive. END
BEGIN NOW       Never again will I come back here. END
BEGIN NOW       Rude rude rude. END
BEGIN NOW     Sometimes, I just have to scratch my head and wonder about people's taste. END
BEGIN NOW       Yes, it's subjective. END
BEGIN NOW       But I can't for the life of me figure out why this restaurant gets such rave reviews. END
BEGIN NOW      Is there such a dearth of good Bay Area restaurants?  After seeing this on Check Please, Bay Area and realizing that this place was just around the block from my work, I was excited to try it. END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered the Blue Plate Special of crispy shrimp tacos and a cup of the pozole. END
BEGIN NOW       The tacos came with a side of pinto beans with small slices of avocado on top. END
BEGIN NOW       The fried shrimp inside the taco was extremely greasy, and the oil tasted stale. END
BEGIN NOW       There was absolutley no flavor in the shrimp taco unless you put the chipotle cream sauce on it. END
BEGIN NOW       The tortillas were homemade, fresh and declicious. END
BEGIN NOW       The pinto beans were bland and needed seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW       The pozole was good (served with fresh tortillas), but had way too much cabbage in it (it was basically cabbage with a little broth) and a few hominy kernels. END
BEGIN NOW       The taste of the broth was great, albeit a little too spicy for me (and I like hot). END
BEGIN NOW     Oh, I also had a chocolate chip cookie - which was tasty, but clearly just a Nestle Toll House cookie recipeOverall, I would not go back again. END
BEGIN NOW       I would rather have good, authentic street tacos from a taco truck then to have poorly done Mexican fusion. END
BEGIN NOW     Great for lunchCasual, airy spaceOrder at the counter and food arrives promptly at your tableChicken tacos are good. END
BEGIN NOW       Waitress thought we ordered the pork belly and she got super excited until we told her it was the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW       So next time we'll have to try the pork belly and see what all the excitement was about. END
BEGIN NOW     Chips, salsa &amp; guacamole are also yummy as a filler. END
BEGIN NOW     Lunch special - two tacos &amp; agua fresca = $9Not a bad deal. END
BEGIN NOW     My bf and I thoroughly enjoyed our food at Cosecha. END
BEGIN NOW      We got the fresh tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole as well as the pozole. END
BEGIN NOW      The ingredients were very fresh and flavorful and we were happy with our selection. END
BEGIN NOW      The mimosas seemed to use fresh squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW       Five stars for the food. END
BEGIN NOW      Service-wise, there is room for improvement. END
BEGIN NOW      My bf and I both ordered pozole and his came out very nice, and mine looked very sloppy and missing the toppings that he got. END
BEGIN NOW      I value toppings more than he does, so I was very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW       The waitress reluctantly offered to get me more toppings, but never returned. END
BEGIN NOW      My over-easy eggs also came out sunny side up and I had to request it to be corrected, luckily it came out fine. END
BEGIN NOW     Tacos here will cost you an arm and a leg but you are definitely paying for good quality products. END
BEGIN NOW      The pork belly tacos washed down with a horchata is highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW     Very good, very straightforward but surprisingly sophisticated Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW      Think more a casual, "Frontera Grill" than a "Chevy's". END
BEGIN NOW      You will not find everything slathered in cheese to the point of being a formless blob, bathed in a sea of refried beans. END
BEGIN NOW      The spices are the main draw, and it's fresh and fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW     It's counter service, and there are some great and affordable Happy Hour specials. END
BEGIN NOW      There's also a super cute, kinda flirty guy at the counter, which doesn't hurt either. END
BEGIN NOW      ;)Definitely coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW     We were there for dinner last night. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is interesting: trendy food court of Swan's market. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything we had was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      We've tried the fish tacos (delicious), the pork belly tacos (amazing), grilled squash with corn and pumpkin-seed chile (awesome) and the mango-kumquat salad (mmmmmh). END
BEGIN NOW      Their drink and desert menu is on the short side but gosh, the food is good. END
BEGIN NOW     I've eaten at Cosecha twice, now, and this second dining experience has really confirmed for me that this place is committed to homey, artisan like food with seasonal and fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the Blue Plate Special- fish tacos with a huge, savory bowl of black beans. END
BEGIN NOW       The beans alone were so perfectly seasoned and warm and tender with a lovely gravy/like sauce -- almost a really thick black bean soup. END
BEGIN NOW     The fish tacos were composed of pieces of fried cod, a sour cream chipotle sauce, one slice of jalapeño, and some cabbage in a corn tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW       Beautifully fried fish that had a very delicate and light texture. END
BEGIN NOW       The service was super excellent and friendly and very respectful-- really top notch service. END
BEGIN NOW       Furthermore, the young man who served me recommended their house hot sauce-- which was bright with a great kick. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambience is of an open air market; very comfortable and pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW       I am so lucky this place is two blocks from my office, and it's just perfect for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW     I really like the ambiance of this place. END
BEGIN NOW       Well, depends, I would imagine you may run into the occasional individuals who think they own the place because of their privileged lives (but that's another story). END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the fish tacos here (comes with black beans and rice) along with the Chips and Guac. END
BEGIN NOW       For the beverage, I got the horchata latte which is pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       The fish tacos, beans, and rice were pretty good but for $13 bucks, I cannot say it's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW       I must say though that the chips, salsa, and guac were very very good and I would pay the same amount for that item. END
BEGIN NOW       My bill came out to be about $22 bucks. END
BEGIN NOW       Service: I would like to thank the employee who brought the food to the tables, and also took our dishes away later on. END
BEGIN NOW       Very nice and courteous. END
BEGIN NOW       5 stars for him!Would I come back?  Maybe under the right circumstances but would not go out of my way to. END
BEGIN NOW     Ok the huevos cuahutemoc are solid!. END
BEGIN NOW     Great authentic mexican food! Ran into this place, I had the quesadillas best ones I have ever had at a restaurant! Homemade fresh tortillas! I will be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was excellent, atmosphere is hip. END
BEGIN NOW       We ordered the yam and cheese quesadilla for the little ones and they enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered the pork mole. END
BEGIN NOW       It was extremely too spicy and the chef provided me with something less spicy that I could share with the kids. END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha = Delicious beyond words I can't have enough type of food !!! Cosecha  is home to me :) I worked at Cosecha for lil over two years. END
BEGIN NOW      Even thoe I no longer work there I still come back to enjoy the food with out the work lol everything is so delicious full of flavor I could eat any plate but I must have to say my all time faves would be them shrimp tacos follow by some pork belly tacos it literally melt in your mouth and I can't forget about my mushroom quesadilla with pork. END
BEGIN NOW      If we talking brunch CHILAQUILES VERDES POR FAVOR !! but no matter what I get here it always need to come with a side of beens. END
BEGIN NOW      Those beans OMG I remember taking my lunch break and asking for a plate of beens with chicken, sour cream, pico de gallo, Guac and salsa verde sooo simple yet so amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      (To bad this is not a menu item :( sorry non workers of Cosecha) my now husband (boyfriend when I work at Cosecha ) LOVES them and he not a beens fan, for him me going to cosecha with out him is the end of the world. END
BEGIN NOW      He would be like "but you know I love cosecha " Indeed we do and not only do we love Cosecha but do we love even more its owner and chef Dominica with out her we wouldn't have Cosecha !! She's just amazing I don't know who is happier us when we go or her when she see us. END
BEGIN NOW      I would always go back to Cosecha no other food can compare. END
BEGIN NOW      I love recommending Cosecha because I know I would get that "OMG the food is amazing I can't wait to go back thank you " hahaha never fails. END
BEGIN NOW      I would deff bring my future kids for a kids quesadilla while sipping on a HORCHATA LATTLE I sure gone need that caffeine but it would be a treat as well :). END
BEGIN NOW     Cosecha is a really casual spot- you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. END
BEGIN NOW      The shrimp tacos were great, and the breakfast torta was hearty and delicious!Come early if you want the horchata latte- they were already out by 1:30 :( Well, come early in general. END
BEGIN NOW      They ran out of chips before we got there too. END
BEGIN NOW     Locally sourced ingredients with a focus on social justice. END
BEGIN NOW      She trained at Chez Panisse. END
BEGIN NOW      He's a professor at Cal State East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW      How could you not support this fabulous restaurant?!. END
BEGIN NOW     Excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything I've tried has been absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I grew up in Santa Ana and have traveled extensively throughout Mexico and Latin America and can say that the food here is quite authentic and definitely flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW     The green mole is fantastic and the handmade tortillas are a treat. END
BEGIN NOW      I highly recommend the queso fundido. END
BEGIN NOW     Great Mexican joint. END
BEGIN NOW      However, the portions are very small for a high price. END
BEGIN NOW      I would suggest the tortas, over the the tiny tacos ($3. END
BEGIN NOW     65) and pork belly tacos ($4. END
BEGIN NOW     50). END
BEGIN NOW      If you want good tacos for a reasonble price, head over to Mi Rancho taco truck on 1st ave and 14th street. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was good, can taste the quality. END
BEGIN NOW      Pricing for a shop like this was way off. END
BEGIN NOW      15 bucks for two tacos. END
BEGIN NOW     So let me start with what is good: the food is decent and the seating area is nice and good for large groups as you can order at the counter, share large tables, etc. END
BEGIN NOW      Staff are also kind. END
BEGIN NOW      That said, the PRICE IS BEYOND the far reaches of reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      $15 for two tiny tacos and a bunch of white rice (and no chips included) is totally incommensurate with the prices and portions of other high end counter-order taquerias in the area like picante or tacubaya, even accounting for the cost of special ingredients like shrimp, etc. END
BEGIN NOW     original review, September 2014 (update below):WOW. END
BEGIN NOW      I was expecting over-priced and small portions, after reading the gourmet menu -- But I got decent portions of gourmet served in sustainable to-go containers (no petroleum products, no plastic -- all recycled and compostable packages), for a reasonable price and very quickly. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered tacos and bean soup to go, on my way to an evening job. END
BEGIN NOW      It was served with a side of beans, rice and tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW      I had enough for lunch the following day as well. END
BEGIN NOW      EVERY part of the order was outstanding -- The sauces, the garnish, the raw ingredients - all of the highest quality and absolutely delicious! Spicy enough to satisfy my preference for extra chili pepper. END
BEGIN NOW      I also appreciate the ambiance of the place -- I was expecting pretentious, but it's like an open cafeteria with several options and a communal eating area. END
BEGIN NOW      The server was quick and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW      I will be eating here regularly. END
BEGIN NOW       Genuine 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     ** UPDATE June 2015: I had to downgrade my initial 5-star rating to 4-star. END
BEGIN NOW      (See original review, above). END
BEGIN NOW      Unfortunately, the past several times I've visited Cosecha, the server has skimped on portions, with my containers of beans, rice, and guacamole only half-filled. END
BEGIN NOW      Come on, it's expensive enough with those little containers filled up. END
BEGIN NOW      I've noticed that I get more generous portions from certain servers, on certain days + times. END
BEGIN NOW      Less on others. END
BEGIN NOW      I wish it were consistent. END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW     This place is overpriced for the food that you get. END
BEGIN NOW       Seems to follow the food truck trend. END
BEGIN NOW       Not recommended. END
BEGIN NOW     I give this spot a 4 due to service being slow. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered and waited for my drink for some time and funnily asked for it. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe the drink with meal is the norm. END
BEGIN NOW      The vibe is casual and cool but you will hit business lunches as well in full dress. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is a farm-to-table concept. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos are tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      They use a single tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW      The braised beef has a dark, spiced sauce that was nice. END
BEGIN NOW      The chicken had great flavor as well. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't expect a massive menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Last time I was here, their special wasn't actually a deal, it was just an item from the menu that was featured and written on a board, but it wasn't cheaper or 'on special' in any way. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered it, and it said it came with cornbread, but it did not. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked and they said they were out of cornbread, although they did not offer to supplement with something else. END
BEGIN NOW      Small portions for a high price. END
BEGIN NOW     A really nice and open location, with ample seating and a friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried the crispy tacos special, which came with 2 crispy pork tacos (there's also a vegetarian option), pinto beans, and avocado salsa. END
BEGIN NOW      The tacos were actually pieces of pork wrapped in thick, fried taco shells. END
BEGIN NOW      I was disappointed that there wasn't any filling like lettuce or tomatoes, but the avocado salsa was so delicious I was fine just dipping my tacos in that. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely a new experience and fun to eat! The beans were very tasty as well. END
BEGIN NOW     Came back on a few other occasions and tried the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW      The shrimp are HUGE (since they're wild caught) and super juicy/flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW      The fish tacos were a bit of a let-down. END
BEGIN NOW      I feel like the fish alone isn't flavorful enough to warrant a lack of fillings. END
BEGIN NOW      (All the fish tacos had were cabbage, sauce, and a sprig of cilantro) Overall, it's pretty pricy for the amount of food you get. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely not one of the cheapest options around, but I guess you need to pay for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW      And the wait during the lunch rush can be pretty long. END
BEGIN NOW     Had really good lunch here. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices are reasonable, but the atmosphere is very casual. END
BEGIN NOW      You order at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW     We shared the posole. END
BEGIN NOW      it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of cilantro and it had some heat to it. END
BEGIN NOW      Might be too much for some people. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the crimini mushroom quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW      It was perfectly grilled. END
BEGIN NOW      The salsa that came with it was very good. END
BEGIN NOW      And the guacamole was right on. END
BEGIN NOW      Right amount of spice and lime. END
BEGIN NOW     My SO's wild shrimp tacos were good. END
BEGIN NOW      Two fried shrimps in each taco. END
BEGIN NOW       But the side of beans was little bland. END
BEGIN NOW     Oh and we had a choc chip cookie, free for asking. END
BEGIN NOW      It was on the counter. END
BEGIN NOW     I would be definitely back. END
BEGIN NOW     When this place first opened I had the same complaints as some other reviewers here - high prices, small portions, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW       Here's the thing though:  This place has seriously upped its game over the past few months, to the point it is now cranking out some of the best food in the bay area. END
BEGIN NOW       No joke, this place is worth a special pilgrimage, especially on mole Monday. END
BEGIN NOW       The mole verde is just OUT OF THIS WORLD good. END
BEGIN NOW     I almost always get the blue plate special. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a reasonable sized portion and the food is just exquisite. END
BEGIN NOW       Sure it's a little pricier than most east bay tacquerias (more at an SF level), but the quality and sophistication of the food more than merit the (still very reasonable) price. END
BEGIN NOW       They make their own tortillas and all the ingredients are absolutely top notch. END
BEGIN NOW       The presentation is also really well done. END
BEGIN NOW     I like the set-up, too. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a particularly nice place to eat on a sunny day, with the open air feel and outside tables. END
BEGIN NOW     Finally, the service has gotten noticeably friendlier over the past few months. END
BEGIN NOW       A trend I hope will continue. END
BEGIN NOW     It was definitely time to upgrade my review to five stars. END
BEGIN NOW      I come here multiple times a week. END
BEGIN NOW      This is my neighborhood spot and I always feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW      Love that the menu changes seasonally. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm not sure what happened to the people who got bad service because when I went the service was perfect and very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I had dinner here on a Saturday night with my wife and we loved it, the location is great and historic the food was very good, fresh, great quality ingredients and good sized portions. END
BEGIN NOW     The homemade chips are fresh crispy and really tasty, the tortillas are handmade warm tender and awesome, the beans are really good overall just super good mexican food, I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW     I am excited to see restaurants taking a chance with mexican food and not doing the same old taqueria thing. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is decent. END
BEGIN NOW      Pricing of the tacos is a bit expensive. END
BEGIN NOW      The customer service could use improvement. END
BEGIN NOW      I will most likely not return due to the manner in which I was spoken to when I wanted modifications to my meal. END
BEGIN NOW     Love their shrimp taco and posole soup, love the food, love the ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are looking for a good heavy meal and unique beer in Oakland, the Hog's Apothecary is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW       Its a small neighborhood restaurant, that has an industrial tap house feel. END
BEGIN NOW       The staff was friendly and service was great. END
BEGIN NOW       I would not say the service was particularly fast or slow, but servers were attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. END
BEGIN NOW      I really enjoyed the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW       It seemed to feature mostly small local breweries (many I had never even heard of). END
BEGIN NOW       The variety of the beer selection was great and everything we tried was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW       I love trying new beer, especially from small California breweries, and I loved that this restaurant offered a wide variety of choices. END
BEGIN NOW      The restaurant does take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW      They seem to be busy while we were there so if you can get a reservation I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW       However (according to the website, only some of the restaurant can be reserved, so they also take plenty of walk-ins). END
BEGIN NOW       There are two TVs above the bar area, so If you are hoping to catch a game on TV they have you covered. END
BEGIN NOW      Our food was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      All of the small bites were great. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel was my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW      That alone could have been my meal. END
BEGIN NOW       The spicy mustard was GREAT, but spicy!! If you love horseradish you will LOVE this mustard (and its perfect with the buttery flavor of the pretzel). END
BEGIN NOW       I had the Titanic salad. END
BEGIN NOW       It was great and plenty of food for a main meal. END
BEGIN NOW       My husband had half dozen oysters and ribs and he had nothing but positives to say about that. END
BEGIN NOW       My only criticism about the experience was that the restaurant was very warm inside. END
BEGIN NOW       The windows were open but it didn't seem to provide much airflow. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a small space, so with the kitchen cooking and a full restaurant it can become uncomfortably warm. END
BEGIN NOW       Overall, great beer, yummy food and nice people. END
BEGIN NOW       We will definitely go back. END
BEGIN NOW     Pros:  fast and friendly service           Food is hearty and good           Good beer selectionCons: food is very heavy . END
BEGIN NOW     but it's good. END
BEGIN NOW     First time dining here today. END
BEGIN NOW       Had reservations for Mother's Day. END
BEGIN NOW       We were seated quickly, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our waiter showed up. END
BEGIN NOW       I had been looking around, with pleading eyes, hoping maybe someone could take the time to get a mimosa started for a mom. END
BEGIN NOW       But no. END
BEGIN NOW       No water, nothing. END
BEGIN NOW       The place was still half empty. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was really good though. END
BEGIN NOW     My son ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits were kind of drowned in the gravy, so my son wasn't eating them. END
BEGIN NOW       I asked if he could have a dry biscuit and they said sure no problem. END
BEGIN NOW       Of course surprise when the bill came- they just had to charge us the $5 for the dry biscuit- which was about 15 cents of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       If they had warned us at the time they they weren't simply trying to help a customer be satisfied with their meal, and would be charging us, maybe I would not have been so annoyed. END
BEGIN NOW       But between the 20 minute wait for service and the nickel and diming, it left me not looking forward to a return. END
BEGIN NOW     If you care nothing about service, this place will be just fine. END
BEGIN NOW     Visited today 5. END
BEGIN NOW     4. END
BEGIN NOW     16 I was working from home today and my friend stopped by to visit me. END
BEGIN NOW      We got really hungry and decided to be adventurous and try a new place. END
BEGIN NOW      The hog's apothecary has been on my list for quite some time now. END
BEGIN NOW      I bookmarked it for their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW      It was pretty empty for a Wednesday at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess it's to be expected. END
BEGIN NOW      Sadly, they didn't have the corn dog offered today at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I decided to get the trail park boy. END
BEGIN NOW      Their bread is good! The mortadella was new to me. END
BEGIN NOW      I liked it, a bit too salty. END
BEGIN NOW      Actually salt was a big problem with our meal here. END
BEGIN NOW      We share the supernova appetizer/starter. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a mixed green beet salad with herb crème fraîche. END
BEGIN NOW      It was so incredibly SALTY. END
BEGIN NOW      We kind of forced ourselves to eat it when we honestly should've just sent it back or just stopped eating it. END
BEGIN NOW      The only thing good about the salad was the toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW      My side salad that came with my sandwich was also wayyyy to salty. END
BEGIN NOW      I didn't even try to eat it. END
BEGIN NOW      We drank two jugs of water while we were there. END
BEGIN NOW      This place was pretty disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW      /: I wouldn't come back here unless it was to try their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Excellent experience at this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Communal seating, sports TVs, great service, and gourmet artisan food. END
BEGIN NOW      Their products are quality, and so even though they're pricey, they are decently portioned. END
BEGIN NOW      They change their menu every day, so that's exciting. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun place in Oakland! I came here for dinner with friends after a day of drinking our way through Napa. END
BEGIN NOW     Outside, you'll be impressed with the big clean windows and inside, you'll find community tables and a menu with lots of beers. END
BEGIN NOW     and a surprising amount of hotdogs. END
BEGIN NOW      Most of my group went the hotdog route but I opted for the "Pride of Castroville" which was delicious with juicy artichokes. END
BEGIN NOW      Fun service, chill atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     Lively, quality gastropub that's helping to put the area around 40th Street and Broadway on the map as a new dining corridor in Oakland, with a feel and identity that's distinct from gentrified Piedmont Avenue not far away. END
BEGIN NOW     The first things you notice are the tremendous craft beer selection and the meat/pork-heavy menu. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the beer, the selection is quite extensive and although it features mostly craft brews, it looks like it's been curated to be very comprehensive across all major styles. END
BEGIN NOW      Moreover, if you have any questions about any single beer item, you could ask for a little taste, or you could ask for advice on what pairs well with certain dishes on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     And as for the menu, it is quite meat-heavy (although I assume some items may be vegetarian-friendly or can be made so). END
BEGIN NOW      While items like sausages might sound steep at around $13, the portion size is tremendous, and the case of the "Got Seoul" sausage that they offered recently, it comes topped uniquely with Asian ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      There are even meatier, more substantial entrees available too, all with whimsical names to them. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything is so meaty and delicious, you'll be "mmm"-ing with approval throughout the meal. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall atmosphere is quite friendly and festive, with lots of communal seating, and the place can be packed most of the time. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is also knowledgeable and friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Chalk up another win for the 40th Street area and for the Oakland dining scene. END
BEGIN NOW     Your typical hipster joint. END
BEGIN NOW      Bearded men, beer, beer snacks made in-house, pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW     Crater Lake Root Beer was delish. END
BEGIN NOW      Served in a metal cup with perfectly square ice cubes that don't get in the way, it has a refreshing but light sassafras taste. END
BEGIN NOW      It's $5 for about 10 oz. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretzel was pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW      The mustard was more like wasabi pretending to be mustard. END
BEGIN NOW      The malted mayo was brown mayo. END
BEGIN NOW     The space is pretty comfortable but service was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      No one came to our table for quite a while until we asked. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Hangar steak and eggs were perfectly rare and runny (respectively) and biscuits with friend chicken add-on was gooey and juicy (respectively)Draught iced coffee was strong without being overly bitter and creamy smooth cream. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was quick and attentive and just as hipster as one would expect. END
BEGIN NOW     A happy find in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       Interesting selection of beers and tasty food. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the New York Reuben sandwich and was very satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW       The pastrami is almost shredded, which worked fine, and the flavor was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW       Husband had the meatball sandwich and enjoyed it tremendously. END
BEGIN NOW       Freshly made potato chips were perfectly cooked. END
BEGIN NOW       We will happily go back anytime. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a very difficult place to decide whether it's a 3 or a 5 star. END
BEGIN NOW      I opted for 4 stars, and here's why. END
BEGIN NOW      The ambiance is beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW      The lighting is low and glowing, and extremely inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      The overall setup of this restaurant is well thought out. END
BEGIN NOW      And they have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap; different local breweries with brief descriptions. END
BEGIN NOW      Their food is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a bit pricey for my wallet, but that's with the understanding the local (sustainable) farmers provide produce and meat. END
BEGIN NOW      And it's good. END
BEGIN NOW      Just beyond my budget for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW      I have a pretty decent job and all, but this is Oakland after all, and $25 entrees, no matter how high the quality of food, is just not within my budget of reasonable spending for a single entree, not including drinks, not including  my partner  or her  choice of food and beverage. END
BEGIN NOW      I will probably just stick to going there for some booze. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders are great, the servers are somewhere between mediocre and great, and overall this business seems to have a lot of pride and it presents itself well. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely worth stopping by for a beer and scoping things out. END
BEGIN NOW      It's very inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     ** honorable mention, this is with respect to Jack R review. END
BEGIN NOW      Just wanted to make the argument that Jack's review is wildly inappropriate. END
BEGIN NOW      Not only is it borderline chauvinistic with his constant mention of how attractive the waitress was, but it's inappropriate with respect to how his failure to order left the waitress to awkwardly make suggestions and order food for him, that he later, somehow, "realized" he didn't know what she had ordered, and therefore he did not like it. END
BEGIN NOW      Went on to joke about how his friend nearly pushed the waitress into his lap, then complained about the food again. END
BEGIN NOW      You're a douche, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW      I think you should take your review down. END
BEGIN NOW      **. END
BEGIN NOW     My girlfriend and I went on a double date with two of our friends, and we had dinner at The Hog's Apothecary. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      This restaurant has communal tables which is something that I absolutely disdain. END
BEGIN NOW      As someone who has a busy schedule and is in a long distance relationship, my time with my girlfriend, my friends, and my family is precious to me. END
BEGIN NOW      When I finally get the time to spend with my self-selected company, I hate having to shout over strangers to avoid being drowned out by their own conversations. END
BEGIN NOW      That being said, the communal tables at Hog's were not nearly as cramped as the ones at Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW      You still have to do a lot of yelling though. END
BEGIN NOW      The hard wooden benches were pretty uncomfortable too. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything else about the restaurant was really great though. END
BEGIN NOW      They offer a preponderance of great local and semi-local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the Buddha's Hand IPA from Berryessa Brewing in Winters, CA, and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      It was not overly bitter and had a pleasant citrus taste from the Buddha's hand. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone else enjoyed their beers as well. END
BEGIN NOW     My girlfriend and I started our meal with a soft pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel had a rich, brown skin and was light and airy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I really enjoyed the spicy mustard dipping sauce that came with the pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The heat from the mustard hits you right in the sinuses (in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW     For our meal, we shared the corn dog and the Jamaican Me Crazy sausage. END
BEGIN NOW     Corn dog: Easily one of the best (non-State Fair) corn dogs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW      However, I feel like corn dogs are kind of like donuts. END
BEGIN NOW      Awful ones are still pretty good, and even the best version with the best possible ingredients is only a few times better than the average ones. END
BEGIN NOW      Jamaican Me Crazy: The sausage was tasty, although the jerk seasoning could have been a little more bold. END
BEGIN NOW      I only tasted faint traces of allspice. END
BEGIN NOW      The bun pillow-soft and provided a textural contrast to the pop I would get when biting into the casing of the sausage. END
BEGIN NOW      The potato chips were tasty too. END
BEGIN NOW      While both items were really good, they do seem a little overpriced for what they are. END
BEGIN NOW     Our service was good, although there was some redundancy between the servers. END
BEGIN NOW      Several different people came around to take our orders and this led to some confusion when my girlfriend ordered a second beer and two of the servers mistakenly thought that the other one would get the beer. END
BEGIN NOW      They got it right eventually though. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, I like The Hog's Apothecary and would come back another time for beer and a corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Every time I pass by Hog's Apothecary, it's filled to the brim with customers. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu is filled with (overpriced) sausage options. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess it's their specialty, but no way in hell I am buying into gourmet hotdogs prices anymore. END
BEGIN NOW      I already think Rosamunde and Wurstkuche in LA are overhyped and overpriced so $12+ for a dog? I really don't think so. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead, I tried out the brunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW      At first look, everything is pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW      The servers are nice, the interior is open with long communal tables, and they have an extensive "hipster" beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm on a Belgian kick lately for I get the two Belgian beers and they are both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      After we ordered the food, about 45 minutes have passed and we are already close to finishing our second beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The service is painfully slow. END
BEGIN NOW      In fact, I saw some other tables that came in after us getting their food first. END
BEGIN NOW      What's up with that?They see us get a bit antsy and assure us our food is coming out. END
BEGIN NOW      I receive my French Monsieur which is good, with a nice kick of Horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW      I also try the Apothecary Benedict and must admit, the house made ham is quite good. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything tastes pretty good but they are all pretty much heart attacks on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is definitely better than average but not enough to make me keep wanting to come back. END
BEGIN NOW      The problem with this place, and a bunch of other new hipster joints in Oakland, is that everything is "artisanal" but that doesn't mean it necessarily makes everything taste better nor does it justify the stiff prices. END
BEGIN NOW      There are too many places in Oakland which offers a good beer list and hipster food, but it's kind of getting out of hand. END
BEGIN NOW      What's next, $20 sausage made with baby dragon butt and foie gras? I digress but I didn't feel Hog's was a step above any other already existing places. END
BEGIN NOW      That's why I'll give it an A-OK. END
BEGIN NOW     We brought some of our fam here, because I mean it has hog in the name--- why wouldn't we? They only serve beer and wine, so don't expect a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW       The menu is a great mix of stuff to share and entrees. END
BEGIN NOW       We ordered a mix of bar snacks, appetizers and one entree to share. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything was super tasty! The staff was super awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       The one thing that I didn't like was the bench seating (I need a seat back when filling my belly) and there was no where to hang my jacket &amp; purse. END
BEGIN NOW       We will definitely go back here to try more of the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     My wife &amp; I decided to start out 2016 with brunch here today. END
BEGIN NOW       Brunch was quite busy today, so it was good that we made a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW       She started with a mimosa, while I had a pint of hefeweizen (a tough choice, as they have over 25 beers on draft). END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered the chicken and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW       You can get either maple syrup or gravy with this order, but I recommend the syrup. END
BEGIN NOW       The onion waffle and fried chicken are very savory, so the sweetness of the syrup brings a nice balance. END
BEGIN NOW       They use boneless chicken thighs, so you can forgo utensils and just dig in with your bare hands!My wife ordered a benedict, which comes with the house pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW       The egg was cooked perfectly, but the dish (along with the house potatoes) were a little on the salty side. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered a side of bacon to share, which could have been cooked a little longer. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was excellent:  attentive, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW       The place got pretty loud as it got crowded, but it was very festive for the holiday. END
BEGIN NOW     I was out Free Wheeling and I had a fresh Charge on my Ankle Bracelet . END
BEGIN NOW      Today was a good day to eliminate another Book Mark . END
BEGIN NOW     So I rolled to The Hogs Apothecary and Oaktown. END
BEGIN NOW     I rolled up and Parked right across the street . END
BEGIN NOW      No Parking Lot just Street Parking . END
BEGIN NOW     They also have Bike Parking right up front. END
BEGIN NOW      The Cool Thing is the Front Door Handles are Shaped like Giant Meat Cleavers. END
BEGIN NOW     I was Greeted upon Entering and  Grabbed  a Seat at the Bar. END
BEGIN NOW      The Furnishings are Very Sturdy and some of it is from Repurposed Materials very cool. END
BEGIN NOW      Their Bar Menu and Food Menu Change Daily . END
BEGIN NOW      They also Butcher a Whole Pig every Tuesday and they use every part in Meal preparation . END
BEGIN NOW     They have 2 LCD TVs for Sporting Events . END
BEGIN NOW     They also have a Nice Big Open Air Skylight . END
BEGIN NOW     Their Bartenders are a Wealth of Info . END
BEGIN NOW     They have several Micro Brews on Tap. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a Whippersnapper -Southern English Style Brown Mild Ale . END
BEGIN NOW      I Liked It. END
BEGIN NOW     I then ordered a Chocolypto - Imperial Stout with Oatmeal and Cacao . END
BEGIN NOW      I really like this one it was Rich and Robust . END
BEGIN NOW     My Final Beer was Framboos / Batch 28 -Belgian Style Ale with Raspberries . END
BEGIN NOW      This is a Must Order very Flavorful and Fruity . END
BEGIN NOW     For Dinner I Ordered The Belgian Braise - House Butchered Pork Shoulder braised in Societe ale , heirloom grits , charred radish rapini  braising  jus ,hard herb- bread crumb salsa . END
BEGIN NOW     This was very good the Pork was so Tender it melted in my Mouth . END
BEGIN NOW      Yummy I also ordered a Corn Dog and it Came with House rendered Lard Fried Kennebec Potato Chips and Mixed Pickles . END
BEGIN NOW      This was also good . END
BEGIN NOW     My Servers were Very Nice and Prompt . END
BEGIN NOW      I Paid By Discover Card and Rolled out. END
BEGIN NOW     The fried chicken was piled high and looked scrumptious, but it was raw. END
BEGIN NOW       Not under done, not pink. END
BEGIN NOW       Gelatinously raw. END
BEGIN NOW       I asked that it be removed from the bill which they did, but I was surprised our server didn't seem more alarmed by the fact that raw chicken made it onto the plate. END
BEGIN NOW      This is fine if you like communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW     It took me awhile, but I finally got to try Hog's and for brunch, nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW     I came on a Saturday and there was a good crowd and we got seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW      I had one of their many beers on tap, though I don't recall which one. END
BEGIN NOW      I went with the Belgian Waffles with Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffles were savory and the fried chicken was a must. END
BEGIN NOW      Otherwise, what's the point? The dish was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      Though the person I was with got the something else, it was very small for the price, even though my dish was a bit pricey as well. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't remember what he got, as it is not on the menu online. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is good and the service is good as well. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a place I would come to every once in a long awhile, but certainly worth a try. END
BEGIN NOW     I live down the street so I always end up here when I can't make a decision on what to eat. END
BEGIN NOW      Great beer selection and excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW      Menu is always changing, which is nice because I can always order something new. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender told us they base their menu off of what is available that day. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, service has always been super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I should have ordered the Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     As good as that dish looked though (and as much as I wanted to try it), I knew I had to order something pork related. END
BEGIN NOW       After all, between Hog's Apothecary's name and their giant pig statue that hovered behind me, it'd practically be sacrilegious not to!  And I am not one to mess with the pork/bacon/pork belly powers that may be (all hail, Bacon!). END
BEGIN NOW     With a menu that is constantly changing, Hog's Apothecary has a lot to offer, even if the day's menu isn't super extensive - roughly a dozen starters and sides, a handful of sausages, and a few different entrées. END
BEGIN NOW       What's more, there's beer and lots of it. END
BEGIN NOW       With over 25 varieties on tap (mostly craft brews), you could even forgo eating and just sample beers all night long. END
BEGIN NOW     -- SPICY PORK CRACKLIN'S. END
BEGIN NOW     $3(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…)These cracklin's are crackin'!  Not only are they borderline addictive, but they really do pack some heat, as every piece is coated with a spicy, mouth-watering seasoning (don't forget the lime!). END
BEGIN NOW       What's more, the portion is quite generous!  A great starter for groups to share. END
BEGIN NOW     -- BOURBON-CHICKEN LIVER PATE. END
BEGIN NOW     $6(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…)Although larger slices of bread would have been nice to spread out all that pate, I'm not definitely not complaining about those giant gobs either!  While every bite was rich and decadent, the taste was also nicely accentuated by the sea salt and the berries. END
BEGIN NOW       If this isn't the best one I've had, it wouldn't be far behind. END
BEGIN NOW     -- SUPERFECTA SAUSAGE SANDWICH - Pork, Rabbit, Chicken, Tim's Brown Ale, Basque Chili &amp; Mild Herbs, Fennel-Onion Braise, Dijon Mustard. END
BEGIN NOW     $14(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…)The only blemish, but it was a big one. END
BEGIN NOW       I was hopeful for trio of meats in the sausage, but it wasn't even juicy, let alone flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW       Ironically, the braise had the opposite effect, overpowering whatever flavor the meat had with fennel. END
BEGIN NOW       Sadly, besides the chips, the only other thing I enjoyed were the pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW     As underwhelming as my order was, it really was the only "bad" thing about my experience. END
BEGIN NOW       Great food otherwise, an awesome selection of beers, fantastic staff (they let our large party split our bill into smaller tabs), and (relatively) easy parking. END
BEGIN NOW       Plus, with several long tables, Hog's Apothecary is grew for groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, it's worth noting that the rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit (we all ordered different things), so it wouldn't surprise me if what I had just wasn't one of their better dishes. END
BEGIN NOW       Especially since the starters were really good. END
BEGIN NOW       Rounding up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I wonder what might have been if I had only ordered the fried chicken!. END
BEGIN NOW     4. END
BEGIN NOW     5 StarsProsA great variety of draft beers + a flight option Pretzel was easily shareable and well done Fun atmosphereChill staff ConsUmmmm can be pricey depending on your beer choice Overall ThoughtsWhile I enjoyed my experience with the beer I want to come back for the food to see if it can be bumped up that last half star!. END
BEGIN NOW     Order the meatballs (appetizer) and fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      They have tons of beer on tap!  I was in the mood for cider and they had 2 to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW     I can wait to come back here. END
BEGIN NOW       Such a gem!. END
BEGIN NOW     Will not be returning. END
BEGIN NOW      I give the ambiance, environment, resources (food and drink) a mediocre mark, nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW      It was the service I wasn't happy with. END
BEGIN NOW      I have not ever been talked to like that here in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW      I brought my service dog and two friends and was felt less than welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW      Although we did get to sit down for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW      Our waiter, the bartender, Josh H, near beginning of dinner, was kind of an asshole to my friends and I. END
BEGIN NOW      He immediately had a tone upon first approach like he wasn't going to like us, asking about my small dog. END
BEGIN NOW      I told him we had already talked to the manager and were welcomed to sit down. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt like he would have told us to leave. END
BEGIN NOW     Josh came over to my friends and I to get our drink order. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend had a question which left much to be interpreted. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead of helping my friend out he insulted her by remarking "how all over the place" her question was. END
BEGIN NOW      I was floored. END
BEGIN NOW      I later asked for a glass of water. END
BEGIN NOW      Of course I had my dog in my lap away from others, I gave him a chance to drink out of the glass. END
BEGIN NOW      Josh comes out of nowhere and immediately rips the glass out of my hand and scolds me. END
BEGIN NOW      Stroke two. END
BEGIN NOW      We were all ready to leave by this point. END
BEGIN NOW      He returned with a paper cup of water for my dog. END
BEGIN NOW      Sweet? Hardly. END
BEGIN NOW      He also assumed we wanted separate checks when we did not. END
BEGIN NOW      Perhaps he was having a bad day but a first impression is a first impression bud. END
BEGIN NOW      Terrible service. END
BEGIN NOW      Money is tight for most and I wouldn't waste a second try on somewhere that was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW      In order to harvest a community you should probably be more friendly to your locals and their pooches. END
BEGIN NOW      Word spreads fast. END
BEGIN NOW     It's currently SF Beer Week. END
BEGIN NOW       Like, I'm sad that I even had to work at all this week, but I need the money to taste the beer, so here we are. END
BEGIN NOW       Last night, the hubs and I met some good friends at the Hog's Apothecary as they were hosting brews from FiftyFifty Brewing. END
BEGIN NOW       I stalked the menu online, and many of their offerings are meat and pork and sausage and YES. END
BEGIN NOW       Our server was very friendly and very attentive. END
BEGIN NOW        A+Location - near (in?) Temescal in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       I hear this is a notorious hipsterville area. END
BEGIN NOW       No matter, this place is kinda by itself on a corner. END
BEGIN NOW       Walking in, there are picnic tables, so you sit community style with others. END
BEGIN NOW       There was a bar to my right, communal seating in the middle, and bar seating along the left edge. END
BEGIN NOW       I enjoyed the decor, but man, it's loud AF in there. END
BEGIN NOW       We were there in the evening, after 7pm and it wasn't super crowded, but it sounded like it. END
BEGIN NOW      We were fortunate enough to be able to move to a corner booth so we could hear our own conversation. END
BEGIN NOW      Beer - I sampled two beers and shite, I can't remember the name of the FiftyFifty beer. END
BEGIN NOW       It started with an M, if I remember correctly, and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       Winner winner!  The second beer was the German Table Beer, a dark German session with wheat. END
BEGIN NOW       Also delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       I wish it hadn't been a Wednesday night because I would've picked at LEAST three more to try. END
BEGIN NOW       The selection is superb. END
BEGIN NOW       Most of my stars are dedicated to this. END
BEGIN NOW     Food - We ordered the Snack Bar and split among us four. END
BEGIN NOW       I think it's a good bang for your buck. END
BEGIN NOW       You get a HUGE fresh soft pretzel, house made corn nuts, olives, and pork cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything on that platter was delicious, though I feel as though the cracklins were a little stale. END
BEGIN NOW       Could've just been me. END
BEGIN NOW       Hubs and I split the Steph Currywurst. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a good portion for one person. END
BEGIN NOW       That was my bad. END
BEGIN NOW       Not too overwhelming with the curry flavor, with nice pickled onions and chips on the side. END
BEGIN NOW       I left needing something else though. END
BEGIN NOW     I took away a star due to price. END
BEGIN NOW       Yes, the selection is great. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is well thought-out and complementary to the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW       It was pricey for me though (see 1st paragraph). END
BEGIN NOW       A sausage dog, although delicious was $14. END
BEGIN NOW       Overall, still a good place. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd come here again on a semi-full stomach to sample more beer. END
BEGIN NOW     Great brunch place! Friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      Sat at the bar and was served by a cool guy from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW      A wide variety of beer on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      The Royale with Cheese was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The oysters were sweet. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely return to try the pumpkin pie donut holes!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you want a sausage and beer, this is definitely the place to be! Also, if you're a giant hipster, go here:) the quality is excellent, the vibe is trendy (in all it's dark wood and metal accents, with some great pops of corrugated metal at the bar). END
BEGIN NOW     This place is a major thumbs up, bring your friends and it'll be a great time!. END
BEGIN NOW     I am glad I like this place because it's literally across the street from me. END
BEGIN NOW      Be aware it gets PACKED and it's really not the place to just drop in for a beer on the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      They are really particular where you sit too so aside from the bar you must check in with the host/hostess. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is good however a bit overpriced but the pretzel is huge and very reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW      But you're really coming her for the beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW      Let me say that again-- the beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW      A ton of time goes into crafting this and you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone working there knows a ton and will recommend and let you tastes everything first. END
BEGIN NOW      I miss the little shuffle board they used to have but they totally needed the space given how popular Hog's has become. END
BEGIN NOW      It's great for the neighborhood and I am a big fan. END
BEGIN NOW     Bacon. END
BEGIN NOW      Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      Fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      Millions of local brew on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      This man I know, who I call Lester, not his real name, of course, who is from the great state of Iowa, would have loved this place like hog in mud. END
BEGIN NOW      My pre-race meal. END
BEGIN NOW      It was very children friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I unfortunately was having a discussion with my dining partner about why men always cheat when a young couple with young children sat down. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes it was a communal table style. END
BEGIN NOW      So conversation of controversy could be overheard. END
BEGIN NOW      Though I should not apologize for we have freedom of speech here and plus I know I am right. END
BEGIN NOW      I am the confession chamber to many guy friends who cheat but feel guilty. END
BEGIN NOW     Social commentary aside, this is kind of restaurant that serves the food for the people. END
BEGIN NOW      Basic yet upscale. END
BEGIN NOW      Possibly the best fried chicken with collard greens I have ever eaten. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the pork shoulder with grits, delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Pretzel with two kinds of gourmet mustard, yum. END
BEGIN NOW      But, the most surprising thing was the apple and celery root soup called fruit and root soup. END
BEGIN NOW      Creamy, yes, but also very light and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW      Very girlie dish I think. END
BEGIN NOW      I think the sausages looked great. END
BEGIN NOW      I want to come back to try the local brew. END
BEGIN NOW      Very fashionable. END
BEGIN NOW      This place felt a bit Midwestern and a bit of the South, and slightly Brooklyn. END
BEGIN NOW      Oakland is having a moment. END
BEGIN NOW      I sort of kind of want to share my finds with everyone. END
BEGIN NOW      Time to make some new friends so I can show them how Oaklanders do food. END
BEGIN NOW     We arrived early for our reservation so sat at the bar where we enjoyed some of the amazing beers they have on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      The service and atmosphere was so great we decided to just fine at the bar and what a treat. END
BEGIN NOW      We had bar snacks of olives and spicy pork crackling - both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Next the chickfritz which made me wish I could cook so well. END
BEGIN NOW      For our main we shared the shrimp and grits - let's say I had to strongly resist licking the plate! Final course was the pumpkin and pretzel donuts with a custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll admit to drinking what was left of the custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      The donuts themselves were packed with flavor and delightfully moist. END
BEGIN NOW      Finally did I mention the beer selection? Great choice of local small brews, many of which I love so glad Hogs supports them. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Wasn't impressed with the food or service,but the place looks nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW     This area is infested with hipsters and there's nothing to complain about that. END
BEGIN NOW      This restaurant is exactly what this area needed! Craft beer galore. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a more intimate hipster place with cafeteria tables and a bar stools all around (they really want you to start talking to the strangers). END
BEGIN NOW      What I lovvvvveeee is the style and the Devore of this place. END
BEGIN NOW      The plentiful of windows and the high ceilings. END
BEGIN NOW      It really comfortable here. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a huge selection of craft beer all over the east Bay Area as well as out of town beers. END
BEGIN NOW     For now I only tried their hot dogs and pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel was good! Nice and soft and really big enough for two. END
BEGIN NOW      Just AVOID dipping a huge piece into their yellow home made mustard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      It taste like wasabi. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the hotdog, Jamaican Jerk Off. END
BEGIN NOW      It was ok. END
BEGIN NOW      The Bun broke off cause it was so soft. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausage was good. END
BEGIN NOW      The vegetable they added on top didn't chop off well with the bite. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean it's a hot dog, so simple but they made it so complex that it was hard to understand why. END
BEGIN NOW      I would come back again for the beer for sure. END
BEGIN NOW     Went there again recently and was actually amazed by the food. END
BEGIN NOW      Had mussels and some kind of fabulous salad and vegetable fritter thing. END
BEGIN NOW      It was so fresh, interesting and delicious! (Yes. END
BEGIN NOW      I licked the plate. END
BEGIN NOW     ) Sometimes it's just a matter of respecting your own culinary boundaries and finding the right thing to eat. END
BEGIN NOW      And of course, enjoying The Hog's creative and excellent execution. END
BEGIN NOW     Not sure what's going on but we have been sitting here for 30 minutes! We came in and the waitress took our beer order. END
BEGIN NOW      10 minutes later got our beers! She never came back walked around helping all 10 people in the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      Trying to flag her down no eye contact smh. END
BEGIN NOW      Well at least my dead canary is good. END
BEGIN NOW      oh boy she walked by again!! Check please I guess we can't try the food. END
BEGIN NOW      Let me change it to one star even ride when asking for the check!!. END
BEGIN NOW     I came here during restaurant week and it was pretty busy. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was great and the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW     Excellent beer selection Slowish service, only had maybe 1 or 2 waitstaff for a  busy Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW      I was going to order the corn app but thankfully I was told it was essentially corn nuts. END
BEGIN NOW     Pistachio mortadella was goodPork  crackling was deliciousShrimp grits were absolutely fantasticCorn dog was extremely dissapointing, the breading fell apart and wasn't crispy or thick enough and the sausage was bleh. END
BEGIN NOW     Sorry, but don't believe the hype. END
BEGIN NOW      Although Hog's is a guiding light for the Temescal gentrification movement, the service is kind of pretentious dudes old timey haircuts and ironic t-shirts, the food is meh, and the vibe is kind of wack. END
BEGIN NOW      Thanks for the $7. END
BEGIN NOW     50 beer and microwaved pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      Wah-wahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW     You know, I found the menu very hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe I went at the wrong time of the day? But we were only offered a bar menu and it was not straight forward. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt almost intimidated trying to figure out why we had to de-code it. END
BEGIN NOW      We had to ask the waitress a few times what is what and how we get what we want. END
BEGIN NOW      She seemed at awe why we would ask suchhhh questions but then she served us marinated olives from a MASON jar. END
BEGIN NOW      That was when I figured out we were going to be spending money on cool instead of food, so we nibbled and left. END
BEGIN NOW      I may or may not stick my head in another time, just to see if their regular dinner menu will not be served on burlap or a birds nest. END
BEGIN NOW      The restaurant itself is very pretty though!. END
BEGIN NOW     I went here with two of my friends for Oakland Restaurant Week; unfortunately, we came at dinner and the offer was not available! Bummer! You walk in, and there is a bar, benches (Biergarten status), and stools around the edges. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor was nice and even featured a giant hog. END
BEGIN NOW      FOOD: We got the meatball appetizer and I got the Extras sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW      My friends got the Area 51 and the Kielbasa. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      The food comes with freshly made chips and pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW      The chips were HEAVILY salted that I felt that it was just not good. END
BEGIN NOW      Please hold back on the salt. END
BEGIN NOW      Veggies were fine. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausage combo itself was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      DRINK:I got a double IPA. END
BEGIN NOW      The place has a lot of beer options and are constantly rotating with choices, so beer options are great here. END
BEGIN NOW      SERVICE: I was pleased with the service. END
BEGIN NOW      Our waitress was attentive, but nothing spectacular, but our food and drinks come out in within a reasonable amount of time. END
BEGIN NOW      Although, she took away our full water pitcher and gave it to another party. END
BEGIN NOW      I was confused, but mistakes like that happen. END
BEGIN NOW      OVERALL:To sum it up, very expensive, which probably is why it's 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      For what I ate, the quality, and all, I don't see how I can justify $14 for a "sandwich" (a hot dog). END
BEGIN NOW      We were content with the place at the end of the night, but believed the price and quality disparity was too big. END
BEGIN NOW     I changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW      (after my last visit)Smarmy host. END
BEGIN NOW      Over priced food. END
BEGIN NOW      Yacky, pretentious &amp; droning hipster wannabes. END
BEGIN NOW      It's downright annoying. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not going back. END
BEGIN NOW      'tis a shame. END
BEGIN NOW      Nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW      Great beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW       . END
BEGIN NOW     oh well. END
BEGIN NOW     Great place to get a drink, and the food (at least, our pretzels) is great! They have a large variety of beers. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the red flight, everyone else had lighter beers. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer and the pretzels were all amazing!. END
BEGIN NOW     Quick stop for a snack before heading out to a late dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selections were pretty impressive! Decided to try the Hock &amp; Trotter Terrine - could use a bit of seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW      The flavors didn't mix in together as well as we expected it to. END
BEGIN NOW      Still overall satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW     Despite passing by this place several times on my trek to Piedmont, I had never set foot in The Hog's Apothecary until this evening. END
BEGIN NOW      I had always felt a tad bit put off by the name, as I am a strict vee-gan. END
BEGIN NOW      Their menu didn't seem to be very veg-friendly (rather, not at all). END
BEGIN NOW      However, my friend Lindsey (also a veg) brought me here, and I thought it was pretty neat, as far as bars go. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried the Societe beer flight this evening ($10), which featured tantalizing names for each brew: The Harlot, The Debutante, and The Widow. END
BEGIN NOW      All three of the beers hailed from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was a touch unfriendly, but I've come to expect that same surliness with hipster locales in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW      The dining area and bar were both pretty jam-packed, so the host placed us, standing, at a counter by the window. END
BEGIN NOW      The server seemed to dislike this placement, but where else were we to go? I think I would have bumped this one up to a 5 if the staff had took initiative and found us a table. END
BEGIN NOW      Even so, at the end of the day, all of the beers I tasted were delicious, and I would definitely return to sample more of their cold beverages. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance here is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer is delicious and food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzels with wasabi mustard sauce really opens your airway and taste so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Been here for lunch and dinner now and it's been great!  The menu is limited but with enough choices and diversity for everyone to be able to find something. END
BEGIN NOW       Extensive beer menu but I dont think liquor. END
BEGIN NOW       Seating is communal on some tables to be ready to rub elbows with a stranger. END
BEGIN NOW       Looking forward to going back as they update their menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Loudest restaurant I've ever been in making the experience uncomfortable right as it began. END
BEGIN NOW       The cracklins were chewy, not really crunchy, and didn't have any pork flavor to it. END
BEGIN NOW       The terrine was too subtle and came on bread which tasted like it was a day old. END
BEGIN NOW       My Versace sausage was one of the better ones I've had, well seasoned and juicy with a good kick, served on a soft bun which tasted kind of like a Hawaiian roll. END
BEGIN NOW      The potato chips were fine but nothing special, reminds me of in-n-out fries which are "more fresh" but also just don't taste as good as other stuff you find. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall a pretty average meal in an unpleasant setting. END
BEGIN NOW     Wow! Literally the best benedict I ever had, and from a gastropub no less. END
BEGIN NOW       The meat was amazing and the egg was perfectly poached. END
BEGIN NOW       Excellent job! And I'm typically someone who is very particular with it comes to breakfast (I have a sous vide at home so it's hard to beat sous vide eggs). END
BEGIN NOW       Plus great beer selection on top of that!. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a nice lunch here with a mimosa and a "Vietnamese" sausage sandwich with an egg on it. END
BEGIN NOW      quite good. END
BEGIN NOW      You sit at communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe next time we come here for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     We came back for dinner to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (dropped in without a reservation) and in almost no time at all, we were seated in the exact same place as our first visit back in July. END
BEGIN NOW      We had the same server, AND she remembered us! Pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The blue cheese stuffed figs are not on the menu currently but they make some damn good steak (with blue cheese BUTTER!!! WOWWWW) and fries. END
BEGIN NOW      I loved looking around the restaurant while we were eating and seeing how the staff all interacted with each other - laughing, talking, and at one point I looked up in time to see someone down half a glass of beer. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't mean to imply they're unprofessional; rather I get the impression that people that work here love being around each other and working together in an environment that they enjoy, which definitely makes for a fun dining experience. END
BEGIN NOW      If we lived closer (and made a bit more money) I'd want to be regulars. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously guys, if you're ever in the area, skip the crowds waiting outside Homeroom (although I also love that place) and just go about a block up for some of the best dishes in the east bay. END
BEGIN NOW     Brunched here twice and the food has been delectable:Softshell crab Benedict - I snapped that up the moment I saw it, and so glad I did because it wasn't on the menu the next time I went here!  It was just as good I imagined it would be, plus the potatoes on the side were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Savory waffle + fried chicken - I had this with both gravy and syrup, and really it should be done no other way. END
BEGIN NOW       The fried chicken was boneless (all the easier to inhale you with, my dear), moist on the inside, crunchy but not greasy on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW       The waffles were cornmeal-y, also with the perfect amount of crispness most becoming of a waffle. END
BEGIN NOW       Have this dipped in syrup, and then the next bite smeared with gravy, then a bite of chicken, and so forth. END
BEGIN NOW       I can guarantee the couple next to you who hasn't gotten their entrees yet will be slightly uncomfortable at you and your spouse's eating moans. END
BEGIN NOW       Service was great. END
BEGIN NOW       I would say in the summer be prepared for a cold drink along with everything else. END
BEGIN NOW     Waltzed in here with a reservation for 2, just in case, on a Sunday morning for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Upon first observation, this place is bright, open and cute!! Community tables for the social people and a few private tables for people like me. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend opted for the Pastrami Benedict with Schmaltz Potatoes and I went for the Fried Chicken and Spring Onion Waffles with Huckleberry Jam. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's not forget the mimosas, a brunch requirement. END
BEGIN NOW      Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      That is all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW      Hands down best chicken and waffles I've had so far. END
BEGIN NOW      And I've had a lot. END
BEGIN NOW      No bones! I'm all about bones and meat handles but you know there be places that give you only skin and bones. END
BEGIN NOW      Just meat baby. END
BEGIN NOW      Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm salivating just thinking about it. END
BEGIN NOW      And those schmaltzy potatoes?! I stole them off my friends plate. END
BEGIN NOW      So damn good. END
BEGIN NOW      That flavor! I can't get over this place!. END
BEGIN NOW     This is one of our go-to brunch spots in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is great and we love the space with beautiful light big community tables. END
BEGIN NOW      Some of our favorites include the French Madame, the schmaltzy potatoes, the Royale with cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is always friendly, great customer service. END
BEGIN NOW     Hipster is probably the best way to describe this place. END
BEGIN NOW      The concept, the staff, the menu. END
BEGIN NOW      This is something that you would expect in Portland - but none of this is necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend up in Oakland had reached out to me, and while looking at reviews for the Trappist, a mention about the Hog's Apothecary caught my eye. END
BEGIN NOW      Fortunately the place was a few blocks from my friend and close to my sister. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend has wanted to try this place, and I was curious. END
BEGIN NOW     We showed up to standing room only - a good sign. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend put her name down with a 30 minute wait, and we found a space to look over the beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW      Really impressive, local menu. END
BEGIN NOW      Some things I've tried, but there was plenty that I had never even seen before. END
BEGIN NOW      Started with the 1903 Pre-Prohibition Style American Lager, which was delicious, and intelligently the beers got added to the menu tab for when we sat. END
BEGIN NOW     Not even 10 minutes later we got a seat. END
BEGIN NOW      Other than the bar, the place features long tables with benches. END
BEGIN NOW      Herein lies the one of problem I see with this place: getting in and up from these benches if you have a middle seat and they are already packed. END
BEGIN NOW      I eventually maneuvered in, but it wasn't easy. END
BEGIN NOW     The possibly daily-changing menu was confusing to say the least. END
BEGIN NOW      I still have no idea what Arlo Shirks or Olin Browns are. END
BEGIN NOW      I get it, hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      But don't make things difficult on your servers and the patrons - call shit out, like everything else on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Regardless, I went the sausage sandwich route that the person sitting next to me also did: a Darkwing (duck and pork sausage with some kind of delicious greens on top) and the fried grits side. END
BEGIN NOW      The Darkwing was delicious and hearty, the chips very flavorful, as were the white veggie side. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried grits were also delicious, but the sausage was big enough that I barely got a dent into the grits. END
BEGIN NOW     Before leaving my friend and I each ordered one of the daily flights: she went with wheat, I went with hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW      The Daphne was delicious, but definitely more on the crisp summer day variety of hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW     I could definitely see coming back, and if I lived in the area, the beers alone might make this a recurring stop. END
BEGIN NOW      Some of the entrees are a bit on the pricey side, but fortunately there are some cheap options so you don't break the bank. END
BEGIN NOW     Great food and rotating taps. END
BEGIN NOW       The staff is also wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW       I visit often and love their brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW     A certain someone wanted to try this place for over 4 months now. END
BEGIN NOW     Here we are at this place with all the open space in the world, but to only see two communal tables in the middle of the room and bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW       Trying to squeezed us into the edge of the communal table (H-E-L-L to the NO!). END
BEGIN NOW      We opted to wait for the bar stools instead. END
BEGIN NOW     With minimal selections, we nibble on some chickpea fritters and meatballs before scarfing down our Moroccan lambs sandwich and hot dogs. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing spectacular about the food when all you're given was some pickles and potato chips to go along with your meal. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm not looking to return to this place but maybe one day along the line. END
BEGIN NOW      In fairness, their service was on point and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Solid food, great atmosphere and interesting beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel is a must. END
BEGIN NOW      Sausages are good. END
BEGIN NOW      Fried chicken is good. END
BEGIN NOW      Totally worth while. END
BEGIN NOW      Though I dig it it's not a place that's like a total package for me meaning I would suggest it, but I wouldn't go outta my way to go there. END
BEGIN NOW      It is for sure one of the better spots in that few block radius - not that there are many. END
BEGIN NOW     Went "cheap" with the Corn Dog ($8) and asked for a recommendation for the 3 small Charcuterie items. END
BEGIN NOW      The waitress recommended the Pork Terrine ($6). END
BEGIN NOW     The terrine comes with toasted slices of Barkada baguette, whole grain mustard, pickle, and olive (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW      Despite having visible herbs it was pretty bland on it's own and definitely needed the mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW     The Corn Dog was superb. END
BEGIN NOW      It's huge and served with lard-y chips, pickles, ketchup and yellow mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW      Strong smokey flavor from the hot dog. END
BEGIN NOW      The chips were all crisp, an improvement from my last visit. END
BEGIN NOW     They need to beef up the little skewer you can see on the left side of my picture. END
BEGIN NOW      I first picked the corn dog up with that and it immediately bent and cracked under the weight of the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Went to check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was okay but service was bad. END
BEGIN NOW     Duck was dry. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing special about the fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      Meatballs were great!!But our server, maybe she was having a bad day, but really inattentive. END
BEGIN NOW       She never came and checked in if I wanted another beer. END
BEGIN NOW      When taking our order she literally left before my friend placed his order. END
BEGIN NOW      She took my order then turned around and left as he was about to place his order. END
BEGIN NOW      He had to track her down and give her his order. END
BEGIN NOW      And she never returned to check how our meals were. END
BEGIN NOW      It became comical but she was not a good server. END
BEGIN NOW      I wasn't impressed enough to return. END
BEGIN NOW      Think it's a lot of hype. END
BEGIN NOW     Here's the thing: the food is sadly only 2-2 and a half stars, but the excellent service bumps it up to three stars. END
BEGIN NOW      1) the fried chicken was covered in gravy. END
BEGIN NOW      Like too much and took away from the crispness. END
BEGIN NOW      No flavor to the batter really and kinda bland. END
BEGIN NOW      Meh. END
BEGIN NOW      2) the corn dog- gf got it and I tried. END
BEGIN NOW      Also just not as good as it looked. END
BEGIN NOW      3) fried pickle appetizers were solid though. END
BEGIN NOW      4) great beer selection I will confirm. END
BEGIN NOW     I was sooo excited to try HA. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm so disappointed that our experience left us irritated &amp; disgusted. END
BEGIN NOW      There was literally 4 other patrons there when we walked in at 5:25pm. END
BEGIN NOW     at 5:30 dinner started &amp; 5 more parties walked in. END
BEGIN NOW     we got outta there at 6pm with NO food order since EVERYONE got service before we did. END
BEGIN NOW      I was appalled no one even stopped by to check how we were doing with our beer that was ordered at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Funny enough there was a black guy at the bar that was there before we got there that no one was checking on either!!!! The food smelled so good but they weren't getting another cent from me. END
BEGIN NOW     they went outta their way to avoid making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW       Make sure you look hipster enough if you want any service from Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW     you just messed with the wrong ONE!. END
BEGIN NOW     Super yummi y'all! Best fired chicken I ever had (albeit probably the smallest portion). END
BEGIN NOW      Their Wiener schnitzel was incredible and I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW     This place has an incredible beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selector knows their stuff. END
BEGIN NOW      Always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I live fairly close to this spot so I frequent this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Hogs does not have anything I eat ( because I'm vegan) but the service, ant the staff are great, so I come anyways. END
BEGIN NOW      My man loves their sausages and I just like the place. END
BEGIN NOW      Good beer and great staff and I like the design of the place. END
BEGIN NOW     Was looking forward to trying this place as I like beer and pork, and it's within walking distance to my home. END
BEGIN NOW       Came with a small  group on a very quiet night (maybe 6 or 7 customers besides us), but was underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      Had a good beer and intended to eat, but was put off by the service. END
BEGIN NOW      Example: When I asked the guy behind the bar if a certain beer was good, rather than a friendly "Yes", and maybe describing it, he just dryly said "Define good". END
BEGIN NOW       Really? You're gonna just throw it back at the customer with two words to prove how cool and indifferent you are?More than one examples of dickish attitude meant we left after one beer each, and a tab that was less than 1/5 of what was likely as we intended to stay for more beers and dinner, but I guess they "won" because they seemed intent on not making us feel welcome and they achieved it. END
BEGIN NOW     In the Yelp listing, it says "Ambience: Hipster" and that's accurate. END
BEGIN NOW       Judging from the snarky/snotty service, it seems they Hog's Apothecary thinks that's a compliment. END
BEGIN NOW      In my experience, even hipsters don't like to think of themselves as such. END
BEGIN NOW      (Are there really people out there who say, "Hipster? I'm there!")This place needs to get over itself and act like they're happy you're there. END
BEGIN NOW       The fact that they don't bother to respond to their Yelp reviews seems to be another example of them thinking they're too cool to care. END
BEGIN NOW     When you see the word "apothecary" in their name, you just know it's gonna be hipster. END
BEGIN NOW       So much so, that I kept feeling like I was in a Portland joint. END
BEGIN NOW       Maybe it was the drizzle outside, maybe the multiple sightings of flannels and beards, whatever it may be, I was down with it. END
BEGIN NOW       This place is simple yet legit. END
BEGIN NOW       A new American Beer Hall is how they deem themselves and I like it. END
BEGIN NOW     Started with a black beer mixed with pinot noir from Moonlight in Santa Rosa and it was super unique. END
BEGIN NOW       Not bad but not something I would want multiples of. END
BEGIN NOW       You can definitely taste the wine. END
BEGIN NOW       Noshed on their bar ready *spicy* pork cracklings and they were incredibly light and sticky on the tooth. END
BEGIN NOW       And spicy was a bit of an understatement, it stung like a mutha. END
BEGIN NOW       I suppose they want you to order another beer. END
BEGIN NOW     A salad of tender butter lettuce, chopped beets, hipster rainbow radishes and a nice blue cheese dressing is a nice starter. END
BEGIN NOW       At $10 it is quite spittable. END
BEGIN NOW     Zsa Zsa $14 is an amazing sausage sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW       A Hungarian style which is like a kielbasa on steroids. END
BEGIN NOW       Don't know if they make their own sausage but this was one helluva meat specimen in tube form. END
BEGIN NOW       It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW       Unique toasted bread, a fresh herb/oil spread and thick cut potato chips. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh I'd grow a hipster beard for this if I could, but I can't, so darn it to hell. END
BEGIN NOW     Hanger Steak $26 was spot on bistro fare. END
BEGIN NOW       Tender bloody meat, blue cheese sauce, sautéed greens and potato gratin. END
BEGIN NOW       Very assertive flavors and if you love beef, this will not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW       Only thing was it came out lukewarm and within a minute it was basically cold. END
BEGIN NOW       But now with a dry hopped steam beer from Petaluma, all was good. END
BEGIN NOW     Like the hood, like the brews, like the staff and like the food. END
BEGIN NOW       What's not to like?!  This place is a total score. END
BEGIN NOW     I am adding an update because I received a note from one of the other bartenders that I have never experienced and he told me to come back when he was working and apologized for the bad experience I had. END
BEGIN NOW     I stopped in late for an after climbing beer and saw that he was behind the bar so I went in. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered a delicious beer, drank my beer and went on my way. END
BEGIN NOW     I was impressed and very pleased by his service and have gone back twice when I see he is working. END
BEGIN NOW      He is definitely the gem of that place and like going in for a late night beer when he is working!. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is excellent. END
BEGIN NOW       The food, unfortunately, is mediocre and overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd be there more often if the waiters weren't so snotty and on top of you. END
BEGIN NOW       They'll get very pissy if you don't order food, even if it's early evening and the place is barely half full. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I live a block away away and I want to come, all the time, and to love it. END
BEGIN NOW      However, due to the poor service I've received on more than one occasion and the clear lack of vegetarian/vegan options I feel forced to give a less than satisfactory review. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm usually fine with ordering the hot pretzel, which to be fair is awesome, and having one (or two or three) of the amazing beers available, and call it an excellent night. END
BEGIN NOW      However, on more than one occasion, I've experienced snobby and/or snarky service, which I find quite uncool (I've worked in customer service for over 20 years and know what it's like to give and receive genuinely warm, welcoming, and helpful service). END
BEGIN NOW     I'll start with the good-often times I've had great servers who were attentive, polite, and top-notch. END
BEGIN NOW      I've had numerous fantastic beers and beer suggestions and a handful of excellent salads and desserts. END
BEGIN NOW      However, more than once I've come across employees who were were way less than helpful, and at times, snarky. END
BEGIN NOW      Boo. END
BEGIN NOW     Me on a Friday night around 6pm: "Hi, I'd love to grab a quick drink"Hostess (with warmth of of a rock): "There's no room at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     "Me: "Oh, see there's a spot by the window, can I take that [which they let me have any other night of the week]?"Hostess: "Some people are waiting for those. END
BEGIN NOW     "Ok, I can't have a quick beer in the meantime? You can't say in a friendly tone, 'you're welcome to wait until something opens up. END
BEGIN NOW     ?'Frustrated, I left and decided to go across town where I felt more welcome. END
BEGIN NOW      I drove by about 15 minutes later (on my way to said place a cross town), and there was still no one in the seat I had asked for (I could see from the huge windows) Glad you keep it for them! (I would have been done, paid, and and out of the seat by then). END
BEGIN NOW     My next experience: on a Sunday night in which I sit at the bar then ask the bartender if any of the sides are vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW      His reply: "Have you seen the name of this place? We can always make you a vegetarian plate if you wish. END
BEGIN NOW     " Thanks, but why the need for a snarky opening? I could reply, and did: you are a business in vey hipster neighborhood full of vegans and vegetarians. END
BEGIN NOW      It's unfortunate that you're not more friendly to those diets. END
BEGIN NOW      He has the audacity to debate with me, which is when I start writing this review. END
BEGIN NOW     On a positive note, when I'm done with my beer the seemingly manager apologizes for any negativity and offers to pay for me beer. END
BEGIN NOW      Thanks buddy! You've kept the door open for another chance. END
BEGIN NOW     Give 'en a try if you're there for a full, non-vegetarian dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      You may really like it! And, if they shape up a bit and tune in to their local clientele and the general requests of their customers, I'll be back on a regular basis. END
BEGIN NOW     Great service and awesome food. END
BEGIN NOW      Have to admit that I was a bit weary going here with all the reviews about too cool for school hipster servers and I am happy to report that hipster is the only true adjective. END
BEGIN NOW     We were a group of five plus one baby and they were very accomodating, making sure that we had the right spot where the kiddo wouldn't be knocked over. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      We scarfed down the soft pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW       Fried chicken was good but not amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      True to the name, anything with a casing is worth ordering and order one of everything!. END
BEGIN NOW     I think the food is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW       I have been known to be a less than adventurous eater so i must point out that everything I have had has had me in awe. END
BEGIN NOW       Love love the always rotating, fresh craft brew selection and they have a couple wines that are de-lish as well as a sparkling for those not into beer. END
BEGIN NOW     I must comment on the 2 star review:  You went to an establishment practically named "pork incorporated" and were surprised at the lack of vegetarian options?  And they preceded to tell you they are always happy to make a vegetarian friendly dish on order (I've overheard them offer this to people and thought that was very accommodating!) and you are still less than thrilled with their service?  And if the local clientele is not being represented with such an establishment, then why are they packed regularly and why did another butchery restaurant open just up the block?. END
BEGIN NOW     Finally had a chance to try this place out as I don't live in the area. END
BEGIN NOW      What a gem! We tried several items on the menu and all to a dish were superbly thought out, created, plated and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       My favorite by far was the charcuterie . END
BEGIN NOW      all made in house of course. END
BEGIN NOW     Beyond the food, the beer list is extensive and eclectic. END
BEGIN NOW       From what the owners said, constantly rotating as well so I'd encourage frequent visits to sample them all of course. END
BEGIN NOW      They also work directly with breweries rather than through distributors when possible so you know care is taken regarding freshness. END
BEGIN NOW      If I lived closer, I'd own a "mug". END
BEGIN NOW     And the atmosphere! Warm. END
BEGIN NOW      Inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      Family friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Not too loud but still fun and great for groups. END
BEGIN NOW       The staff was very service oriented and the chef/owner is constantly circulating the room and ensuring everyone has a fantastic experience. END
BEGIN NOW     The rapini here is arugalized in-house, and their delicious pea tendrils are wilted to order. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't forget to slather the Yemeni skhug on your quatre epices for that extra kick of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Tl;dr: the menu is unrelentingly pretentious, and using inductive reasoning, my party determined all hot dogs are indistinguishable from one another. END
BEGIN NOW     The Hog's . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW     is a nice addition to the flourishing Beer Garden trend that is finally catching up to the rest of the USA. END
BEGIN NOW       Yet this one the lacks the actual outdoor experience one would expect of a traditional Beer Garden. END
BEGIN NOW       Nevertheless, there are many things to like about this one. END
BEGIN NOW       Well, of course the beer selections are very satisfactory ranging from imports and domestics on tap. END
BEGIN NOW       The food delights wells especially the Terrines or the Hogs Head Cheese and and the Charcuteries. END
BEGIN NOW       Nothing too extraordinary here, but the mains and started complement the beer selection nicely. END
BEGIN NOW       However, avoid the mostly unsparing sides like the Brussels sprouts,  etc. END
BEGIN NOW       More time was put into describing them than preparing them, so theylive on this menu as an afterthought. END
BEGIN NOW       The atmosphere is rustic, modern and pleasing ,but it hard to have a conversation here at the larger tables where you nearly have to yell to be hard. END
BEGIN NOW       So if you want something quieter and more chatty, sit by the windows. END
BEGIN NOW     Good food, great service, but this place is so incredibly overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW       $27 for two tiny pieces of fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW       $16 for a tiny salad?  Totally ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW       But delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm from San Diego and this is my second visit to the Hog. END
BEGIN NOW       Both times I have had an exceptional time!!  The customer service and beer selection are outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW       The first time I was there Nicole took great care of this out-of-towner and I knew I had to go back. END
BEGIN NOW       Megan in the bar was super awesome and she really knew her beer. END
BEGIN NOW       She paired me up with a great beer that I probably couldn't have picked of myself. END
BEGIN NOW       After that, Marie, Alice and Christy took over and things were consistently great from there. END
BEGIN NOW       The rainbow heirloom was too good to describe in words, so you might want to go down there in person and try it for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW       Every time I'm in Oakland Im stopping by for sure. END
BEGIN NOW       Thanks for the extra Burrata guys!!  Keep up the good work!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Returned for breakfast and was thrilled to see the Benedict back on the menu, this time with pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW      Combined with the schmaltzy potatoes it is just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      And as previously mentioned the iced coffee is delicious, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. END
BEGIN NOW     service was ridiculously slow! I swear there was one. END
BEGIN NOW      MAYBE two people working and the place was packed! I had the corn dog and I like mustard but that stuff was gross, wayy to spicyoverall just not my kind of restaurant i would recommend going just for a beer due to the large selection but the service would keep from going even for that. END
BEGIN NOW     This is my friend's favorite spot so we've eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks and a dozen, or more, times over the last 4 months. END
BEGIN NOW       The host and servers are always helpful, knowledgable and accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW       They make most everything in house, so they can tell you about all of the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW        This has been super helpful over the last few weeks because I'm doing the Whole30 diet that requires I not partake in a whole host of ingredients (including no added sugar to anything). END
BEGIN NOW       I've had the same super awesome server the last 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW       She knows what I need and has been incredibly accommodating and helpful in working with the kitchen to help me eat there. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend enjoys trying different beers and every server we've had has happily help him choose the best bear to go with his meal. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm don't drinker beer but they've even helped me find one or two that I like (before I was doing the Whole30). END
BEGIN NOW     If you're looking for friendly service, good solid food and a great beer selection this is a place you should try. END
BEGIN NOW     Beer selection can't be beat, and a knowledgeable staff to guide you thru it. END
BEGIN NOW       Menu is meat heavy as expected, and isn't approachable for everyone. END
BEGIN NOW       However the flavors are incredible and every meal I've had there has been delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       Great location for MacArthur BART and I'll be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      Large hearty portions, really tasty and comforting. END
BEGIN NOW      Great selection of beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The service however has room for improvement - can never seem to catch the eye of the one server on the floor at 7pm on a Sunday (who whisked away our water bottle in an attempt to refill it, then forgot to return it until we flagged her down to ask about the bottle's whereabouts). END
BEGIN NOW      The squirrely host is no help either - eyes only looking at the silverware he was setting down. END
BEGIN NOW     Have now been to Hog's 3 times, and I have been beyond impressed every time. END
BEGIN NOW      My fancy beer friends are always stoked with the selection of beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      Being more of a wine girl, I really like that selection is as well. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was DELISH! The summer gems salad was fresh and tasty time. END
BEGIN NOW      The heirloom tomatoes were also super tasty, and the Italian Sausage KILLED IT. END
BEGIN NOW      Go to Hogs, go now. END
BEGIN NOW     Got there for a reservation at 7:30 pm were seated at 8:20pCouldn't hear or think beyond the noise and music. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish dish was dry  and bland. END
BEGIN NOW     Man, this place is awesome!! I came here for the first time a couple days ago and just had to go back last night. END
BEGIN NOW      I found out about the Hog when I decided to Yelp for corn dog places around the bay. END
BEGIN NOW      When this place popped up, I bookmarked it and knew that this place was going to be a winner (have you SEEN the pictures of that sucker?!). END
BEGIN NOW      Located on the corner of Shafter and 40th about a block away from Homeroom, this place is a great location for a quick dinner or to catch up with some friends. END
BEGIN NOW      During the visits, my girlfriend and I got to try their kielbasa ("Who's your Basa?"), corn dog, roasted peppers, and delicious as all-hell potato chips (that are fried in their own pig lard! Yes!!). END
BEGIN NOW      The Hog has a hefty beer collection on tap with relatively lesser-known breweries. END
BEGIN NOW      We met up with a friend and all got to try an IPA with wild rice, imperial IPA, several saisons and a couple of stouts. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't recall the exact number of beers that they have on tap, but it's a very impressive number considering some places in the area only serve up about 10. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're coming here for dinner, make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to just sit at the bar, which really isn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW      The music here is BITCHIN, so prepare to eat good food, drink tasty beer, and groove to some dope music. END
BEGIN NOW     Look, I know that as a vegetarian in a place called "Hog's Apothecary" (or "Hog's" anything else for that matter), I have little right to complain about a lack of food options not made from a pig. END
BEGIN NOW       So I'll only note here that if you are a vegetarian (or keep Kosher or Halal), you are not going to find food here for you. END
BEGIN NOW     We only came here for beer anyway, so I'm not holding it against them. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance here is cool-- very Oakland hip. END
BEGIN NOW       Lots of beer options, so, there's that. END
BEGIN NOW       Greeter and server and person who finally brought our beers were very nice. END
BEGIN NOW     But I was not that impressed with the beer we had in 2 different flights (so that's 6 different beers--multiple opportunities for good beer), and it took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order once we had sat down. END
BEGIN NOW       We actually gave up we were sitting there so long and finally just went to the bar to order there. END
BEGIN NOW       The place isn't that big and didn't have that many people, but it seems like they didn't have enough servers for the space, and so our nice server lady badly neglected us. END
BEGIN NOW       It's two stars for me on this not because it's a bad place in and of itself but because for Oakland, it's a definite "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW      I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW     "  It definitely did not live up to the hype; neither, for me, did it live up to comparisons/experiences/and-mainly-the-beer of Beer Revolution or The Trappist. END
BEGIN NOW     But I'm going to guess that if you like pork with random potentially-not-great-beer that this place is going to be the bee's knees for you. END
BEGIN NOW       Or the pork knees, as it were. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are a beer lover and find yourself in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in here. END
BEGIN NOW      The extensive (mostly local) draft beer list is impressive and is varied enough to keep the whole group happy. END
BEGIN NOW      Our group of 4 started standing by the window while we waited for some seating to open up. END
BEGIN NOW      We then sat at one of the large shared tables in the middle of the restaurant, where we shared a couple bits/starters and two of the house sausages (which are huge). END
BEGIN NOW      Great/lively ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW     Sorry guys! Have always loved the food and amazing draft list but. END
BEGIN NOW      Chill out on the rules. END
BEGIN NOW      The last three times we've been there our experience has been soured by weird overstepping of bar/seating arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW      I've invited multiple guests who've felt snubbed by this. END
BEGIN NOW      I. END
BEGIN NOW     e. END
BEGIN NOW      tonight for my birthday after work our table was approached and I was told we were expected to spend more money on food not just drinks and would have been sat somewhere different. END
BEGIN NOW      This was an odd and somewhat rude admission in light of each person ordering over $30 in drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      I appreciate the attempt to keep the most efficient flow going through the restaurant but the second your patrons feel like pigs led through a feeding trough, you've lost an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't drink beer often but I had a fun time experimenting with the beer menu and having our waitress pick out drinks for me based on my preferences. END
BEGIN NOW       The Harlot (a Belgian pale ale) was my favorite, and given that I overheard a few other parties ordering it, my sense is that it's a pretty popular choice. END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed everything we ordered (pork cracklins, meatballs, summer bean ragout and mixed grill) except for the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW       The hot dog tasted overly smokey and burnt to the point where I couldn't really taste the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW       This was highly disappointing because I love corn dogs, but I still recommend coming here for the other dishes, beer selection and attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW     After a rocky first visit (nothing to do with the food), I'm now a HUGE HOG FAN. END
BEGIN NOW      The cod fritters were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried chicken rocked our world. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was charming and I really appreciated the owners reaching out. END
BEGIN NOW      They've totally solved any service problem they had. END
BEGIN NOW     Food:Spicy Pork Cracklin's - Don't get it, it's not very good. END
BEGIN NOW       It doesn't taste like "real" cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW     Belgian-Braised Pork Shoulder - This is a winner. END
BEGIN NOW       For $27, you make the value proposition on this one. END
BEGIN NOW     Choucroute Garnie - It's exactly what it is albeit I was expecting more meat. END
BEGIN NOW       I think there were 4 meat selections and more saurkraut. END
BEGIN NOW       A great plus is that one of the meats is their duck, which is DELISH!  If I compare it to others that I've tried, this lands on the bottom somewhere (That just means I've experienced tons of kick-ass Choucroute Garnie in my life). END
BEGIN NOW     Beer:Yeast and Hops Flights - All good. END
BEGIN NOW       This place has a great selection of beers and if they curate it as they described, extra kudos. END
BEGIN NOW     Lowdown:I'll probably go back for the beer and the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW       The food and area, not so much. END
BEGIN NOW       I would be here often if I lived in the neighborhood, that's how much I liked my experience. END
BEGIN NOW       Some people will say that the food is over-priced, I can see that argument. END
BEGIN NOW     Recommendation:MAKE A RESERVATION. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the ambience annnnd it's in my 'hood. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm going in a hike tomorrow so I wanted something hefty even though I am currently sans meat. END
BEGIN NOW      So I ordered the Gem &amp; Jewels salad along with the Soft Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      Sooooooo good. END
BEGIN NOW      Omg, this salad. END
BEGIN NOW      For reals. END
BEGIN NOW      Not playing. END
BEGIN NOW      The softness of gem lettuce, the sweetness of the persimmon, the tang of the pomegranate cut with the slight acidic tang of the crème fraiche dressing. END
BEGIN NOW      but y'all don't hear me though. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm sure many have waxed poetic about the pretzel so I'll just say, order it. END
BEGIN NOW      Their beer menu is extensive and the staff is very welcoming. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered one of the sausage combos and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausage was made and cooked perfectly, and the fixings, while not terribly appetizing to look at, were perfect along with the bun. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection is great and I can always find something new to try. END
BEGIN NOW      Despite being busy, service was quick on everything and the manager was also helping out and very responsive. END
BEGIN NOW     I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Their detail to their house made food,  fine local beers and wine is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The corn dog is the best you'll ever have. END
BEGIN NOW      It gets busy and some might say somewhat pricey, but well worth all of it! I've been here several times since they've opened and am always impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      Thank goodness for fine food in Oakland!PS- they just started doing take-out; I cannot wait to eat a corn dog in bed. END
BEGIN NOW      Yum. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a cool hipster place - love the vibe here. END
BEGIN NOW       If you like beer, it is a must. END
BEGIN NOW       I am not a drinker but friends enjoyed it here. END
BEGIN NOW       The hostess was very friendly to the wait staff. END
BEGIN NOW       This is a place to share food and chat with friends. END
BEGIN NOW       It does get kinda loud in here and you need to raise your voice to talk at times. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is good. END
BEGIN NOW     we shared 2 sampler appetizer plate and an entree. END
BEGIN NOW       It was a good taste of all kinds of pork. END
BEGIN NOW       The portions were good. END
BEGIN NOW     not too small and too overly large. END
BEGIN NOW     good size. END
BEGIN NOW       The prices are decent. END
BEGIN NOW       It is nice to have a gastropub in temescal area. END
BEGIN NOW       With home run down the block and blue bottle opening near by, I am glad this neighborhood is up and coming with great eats. END
BEGIN NOW     This is an awesome place for beer lovers - they just have an amazing selection of local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      They also have a selection of ciders, which I tend to order. END
BEGIN NOW      Usually you can grab a seat at the communal tables, but you can also make reservations if you have a bigger party. END
BEGIN NOW      I've found the food to be a little disappointing, with very few options for vegetarians be warned!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are driving to the neighborhood, do NOT leave anything in your car. END
BEGIN NOW      No bags, no cell phone chargers. END
BEGIN NOW       Your car WILL be broken into, and you will not get your stuff back. END
BEGIN NOW     Okay, I swear, it took me a while to choose between 3 or 4 stars - I've seriously been going back and forth for about 5 minutes now! We ordered the mixed grill - I believe it was a mix of 3 different meats (a piece of sausage, pork belly/thickest bacon slab I ever seeeen) and a half of a small tiny bird (I think Cornish game hen??). END
BEGIN NOW     anyways! 'twas delicious and utterly satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW      Full of flavor and goes so gooood with the beer!OH YEAH. END
BEGIN NOW     the beer. END
BEGIN NOW      that's a whole separate story guys. END
BEGIN NOW      this place has a FAT list of brewery-direct beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      they are hand-selected and have a variety from all over the west coast. END
BEGIN NOW      In addition, they're pretty knowledgeable on the beers they offer, so when in doubt, just ask for a suggestion. END
BEGIN NOW      Now. END
BEGIN NOW     the reason I gave 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     the pricing. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean. END
BEGIN NOW     really, for a small ramekin of basically what we Americans know as "Corn Nuts" you're gonna charge $3 for less than a handful? AND. END
BEGIN NOW     they're way too hard to chew, they might be better off sticking in a sling-shot and letting a kid have some fun. END
BEGIN NOW      $6 for a regular pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The plate we got, Mixed Grill. END
BEGIN NOW     small tiny portions. END
BEGIN NOW     was wrong for 2 of us to share, but THAT small plate was $28 :/  yikes. END
BEGIN NOW     Another reason for not giving 4 stars was the attitude of the staff - mostly the hostess, the guys at the tap, and our specific server. END
BEGIN NOW     so I guess that's the majority. END
BEGIN NOW      they had this attitude that came off as if they were "too cool" or "too hipster" to help out and serve normal people coming from work that just want a good bite and beer. END
BEGIN NOW      definitely felt like they're only welcoming to a certain and specific type of crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     guess you need tats, an old leather jacket and a septum piercing to get the thumbs up for them. END
BEGIN NOW      it's a shame, because I would've gone back for their food and beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW     probably on a pay day since its kinda pricey , HAH!. END
BEGIN NOW     Went by again for an early dinner on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW      No wait right at 5pm, but it seemed to get crowded around 5:45pm. END
BEGIN NOW     This time we had a chance to sample more of the menu and I have to say that I was actually really surprised at how good the food was! I was prepared to support this place based on the fact that it serves good beer and is within walking distance of where I live, but now I can legit say it is worth seeking out. END
BEGIN NOW     We had:- charcuterie sampler of pork rillettes, liver mousse, trotter terrine ($13 for the sampler of three). END
BEGIN NOW      Quality: B+, Adesso is way better. END
BEGIN NOW      Quantity: B, too much of the sides, not quite enough of the main bits, but for $13, it was alright- frisee and arugula salad with grilled peaches and humboldt fog toast ($8 I think?). END
BEGIN NOW      Quality: A+, this was perfectly balanced and well-seasoned and the peaches were ripe and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW      Quantity: B, the toast was kinda ridiculously thinly spread with cheese- rabbit &amp; pork belly salad with onion stuff and herb stuff on it, it came with chips and pickles ($14). END
BEGIN NOW      Quality: A+++++ the sausage was incredible. END
BEGIN NOW      I was really blown away by how good it was. END
BEGIN NOW      Served on a nice soft roll that seemed a bit pretzel-like. END
BEGIN NOW      I've eaten at Rosamunde countless times and I have to say, this sausage blows theirs out of the park. END
BEGIN NOW      Seems like maybe they've addressed the "okra slime" issue for the pickled veggie side because I saw no okra and no slime. END
BEGIN NOW      Quantity: B+ the sausage was decently sized but still for the price. END
BEGIN NOW      B+- side of cheddar grits ($6) Quality: A+ hi I love butter cream and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      yummmmmm Quantity: B. END
BEGIN NOW      come on. END
BEGIN NOW      it's grits. END
BEGIN NOW      you could give us more than 1. END
BEGIN NOW     25 cups for $6. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here three times. END
BEGIN NOW      Loved it the first two, really disliked it the last. END
BEGIN NOW       They've changed the menu: they used to have a great salad ("visions of spring") which still shows up on their online menu but was no longer on offer last Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW       The salad I had (which was basically the only option) called the "green machine" was a salty, gloppy mess. END
BEGIN NOW       And worst of all, they "ran out" of the soft pretzels, which was 90 percent of our reason for being there. END
BEGIN NOW      At 8 p. END
BEGIN NOW     m. END
BEGIN NOW      on a Saturday night - really??? Our less than helpful server offered us nothing as substitute (some of the potato chips that came with the dinner the people next to us had would have been good to satisfy the salty craving, but we didn't know about them). END
BEGIN NOW       And our platter of three different salumi only had two. END
BEGIN NOW       I guess they "ran out" of the third variety. END
BEGIN NOW       Finally, our "medium rare" ribeye was raw: presumably they "ran out" of time to cook it properly. END
BEGIN NOW     We love Hog's Apothecary- relaxed local vibe- great beer and cider selection - I LOVE the Graviva personally - their albeit more limited wine selection works even with their focus on draft and craft beer- food is sophisticated, interesting and the menu is always changing- service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable - they now have added brunch which is awesome :)- to date we have always been able to walk in and get seated - we make reservations about 50% of the time as it can get busy for dinner even early in the dining hour. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is great and fairly priced but the food selection is not. END
BEGIN NOW      Well developed flavor with tragically pretentious ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      It is exactly what you should expect from a hipster joint in piedmont, $23 for a pork chop. END
BEGIN NOW      The meatballs were the best thing on the table. END
BEGIN NOW      Bring your horn rimmed glasses. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is very knowledgeable and all I need to tell them is a type of beer I like and they find the perfect match for me. END
BEGIN NOW       Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I have not tried the food yet. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried Hog's Apothecary for the second time. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is very good but the service just horrible. END
BEGIN NOW       I arrive famished on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW       Ordered the Clubber. END
BEGIN NOW       Food arrived about 30 minutes later and the waitress once again quickly disappeared after dropping off the food. END
BEGIN NOW        No apology or acknowledgment on the long time to deliver the food. END
BEGIN NOW       No, "Can I get you anything else?"  No follow up with, "Is everything ok?"   Poof - gone. END
BEGIN NOW       She delivered the wrong sandwich to me, though my partner's was correct. END
BEGIN NOW       Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW       It's such a shame since the food and beer is pretty good here, but not good enough to overshadow the down right poor, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW       Sorry, not going back. END
BEGIN NOW     When going to the restaurant of a friend for the first time, one prepares themselves to be polite, offering words of praise out of the sense of duty that comes with being friends. END
BEGIN NOW       We caution ourselves not to be harsh or critical and generally keep any negatives quiet. END
BEGIN NOW       After all, they are our friends and we'd expect the same. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank goodness I don't have to keep the negatives to myself. END
BEGIN NOW       as I couldn't find any. END
BEGIN NOW       In fact, to say I was impressed would be an understatement. END
BEGIN NOW     Brad and John have taken what once was a dilapidated laundromat with a seedy past and created a neighborhood gathering spot that is open, airy and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW       I was at first slightly put off by the long tables and benches, as I generally prefer not to share my table with people I don't know, but I came to realize that it promotes conversation between strangers and contributes to the neighborhood feel. END
BEGIN NOW       While the dining area is not huge, the high ceiling with exposed beams and open air skylight make it feel much larger. END
BEGIN NOW       "Hog's" boasts more taps than I could get through in a week. END
BEGIN NOW       They have beers on tap to appeal to any beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW       They also cycle beers in and out to keep the selections new and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW       Now. END
BEGIN NOW      on to the food itself. END
BEGIN NOW       We started out with the warm pretzel for two with cheese sauce and mustard. END
BEGIN NOW      ( One thing you must know before I go further. END
BEGIN NOW       Nearly everything you eat is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW       The mustard, the cheese, the sausage, the kraut. END
BEGIN NOW       the exceptions being the buns and, if memory serves, the pretzel itself. END
BEGIN NOW      )  The pretzel was hot and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       The house made mustard and cheese sauce were the perfect compliment. END
BEGIN NOW       There's just no comparison between jar mustard and mustard made fresh that day. END
BEGIN NOW       For my entree I ordered the schnitzel. END
BEGIN NOW       It's really easy to overcook pork and make it dry. END
BEGIN NOW       Not the case here. END
BEGIN NOW       The breading was light, the pork juicy and while I used my knife at first, I ended up using just my fork as it was so tender. END
BEGIN NOW       The arugula and warm potato salad only served to enhance the succulent pork. END
BEGIN NOW       My dining companions ordered the 'Basa' with kraut and the Devil Bird fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW       I was raised by a German mother who made ( and at 70 still makes ) her own kraut. END
BEGIN NOW      As much as I cannot believe I am saying this, ( Sorry, Mom ) the kraut at Hog's is better. END
BEGIN NOW       especially thrown on top of a juicy and savory sausage with just the right pop from the casing. END
BEGIN NOW       ( Sorry, Mom ) The chicken was juicy and full of flavor, but it's the breading that really takes it over the top. END
BEGIN NOW       It's hard to describe, but there's a slight sweetness to it that, to me, was reminiscent of that first bite of a churro or a Krispy Kreme that immediately makes you want another bite. END
BEGIN NOW       It's difficult NOT to want to clean your plate. END
BEGIN NOW     I do have one regret. END
BEGIN NOW       Only one. END
BEGIN NOW       I didn't try dessert. END
BEGIN NOW       We all surveyed the dessert menu, but after a great beer and amazing food there was just no room. END
BEGIN NOW     I know I am a friend and friends tend to be biased so I encourage you to read other reviews. END
BEGIN NOW       Aside from the small contingent of nay-sayers you will find that the overall rating of 4/5 stars is well earned and well deserved. END
BEGIN NOW       It's worth checking out. END
BEGIN NOW     A little spendy for what you get, but everything we had was great and the atmosphere and service was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW     We've visited Hog's a few times now. END
BEGIN NOW       Every single time, we've received amazing food and exceptional service. END
BEGIN NOW       We've left with happy bellies and smiles on our faces. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was great, as were the beers. END
BEGIN NOW       Unfortunately, the service was slow. END
BEGIN NOW       Our server was new, and not super attentive or knowledgeable about the menu. END
BEGIN NOW       Hopefully she'll hit her stride. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess my main issue with this place is that it is not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW       They bill themselves as an "American Beer Hall", which to me means:- A large craft beer selection (check)- A good, informal place to gather with friends (nope-though the potential is there)- Maybe some inexpensive pub style food. END
BEGIN NOW       However, when you walk inside, you are greeted by a hostess and added to the list for a seat at one of their community tables or bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is VERY EXPENSIVE for what it is, and the staff projects a major restaurant vibe, but the atmosphere is that of a bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm really not sure what is going on here but its not at all what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW     For about a year I anticipated their opening and ended up there on the first night they were open to the public. END
BEGIN NOW       I've been back a few times, and it only seems to have become more restaurant-y. END
BEGIN NOW       One positive thing to say, the beer selection is excellent and the price is right for draft beers. END
BEGIN NOW       That said, It's not easy to get in for just a few beers (especially for more than 1-3 people), so I have ended up passing it up when going out with friends even though I live 3 blocks away. END
BEGIN NOW     I really hope that Hog's will make up its mind, are you an up-scale restaurant or are you a beer hall? Right now you are somewhere in-between and it just isn't working for my demographic at all. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're looking for a spot with tons of (mostly) local beers on tap, this is a great spot to visit. END
BEGIN NOW      Death and Taxes is my favorite beer they have. END
BEGIN NOW      They also have a small selection of wines if beer isn't your thing. END
BEGIN NOW      The Grilled Greens starter I had there was meh. END
BEGIN NOW      It was way too salty for me. END
BEGIN NOW      I wouldn't recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW      However, I heard the corn dog is amazing, i will have to try it next time I'm there. END
BEGIN NOW      The Devilbird (fried chicken on top of some spicy garbanzo beans with chili oil) OMG. END
BEGIN NOW      So delicious and perfectly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW      So buttermilky and crispy! I love the fried chicken there. END
BEGIN NOW      It never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is great there, I've never had any issues with the staff whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW      They're always nice and prompt! Also: be prepared to get a little cozy with other patrons, the seating is picnic table style. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer selection, corn dog and hot dog were ok but made in house. END
BEGIN NOW      pate, rillette were on point. END
BEGIN NOW      would def come back for some beer and pate. END
BEGIN NOW     Kinda shocking to read reviews about how snobby the wait staff was, I found the service to be very friendly and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the food and beer - YUM. END
BEGIN NOW      The food was so flavorful, with fresh herbs and the sauce on the pork chops was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW      Loved it so much, we asked the waitress if we could have some bread so we could sop up every ounce, because yes, we are hogs. END
BEGIN NOW      The kitchen specially prepared some toast for us so we could lick the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection was good, the menu described the brews well and I was pleased with my selection. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior is pretty cool, but can get loud. END
BEGIN NOW      Looking forward to returning. END
BEGIN NOW     If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! There food and beer is fantastic! They have an industrial feel to them and sure its a hipster joint but that doesn't detract from the delicious food and beer!Recommendations: 1. END
BEGIN NOW      Butchers coffer. END
BEGIN NOW      Get all three, every time. END
BEGIN NOW      Its worth it2. END
BEGIN NOW      Lil Salty3. END
BEGIN NOW      Any of their sausagesBeer: 1. END
BEGIN NOW      The Butcher 2. END
BEGIN NOW      Tunnel VisionGreat Job guys. END
BEGIN NOW     Only tried the beers here so I can't comment on food. END
BEGIN NOW      There was a great variety of drinks and the bartender was so nice to let me try several until I found a beer I was satisfied with. END
BEGIN NOW      Sucks that its so hard to find a seat here, it seems like they could better maximize their space. END
BEGIN NOW      Also the lighting in here was so dark. END
BEGIN NOW      But overall, another trendy restaurant to hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm a little biased since it's right up my street, but Hog's is a pretty special place. END
BEGIN NOW      The rotating taps, solid food, and ambiance are great. END
BEGIN NOW      Tried their brunch for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. END
BEGIN NOW      Had the pork belly/beef burger and apothecary benedict at our table and both were very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      They also were open to showing the football game our group wanted to watch. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, a solid four stars, and my go-to neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Much, much better reason to come to 40th Street than Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Hot damn. END
BEGIN NOW       We came here for their soft opening, and we've been coming here regularly ever since. END
BEGIN NOW       The food: fantastic, inventive, and there's always something new. END
BEGIN NOW       It tends to be heavy fare (even the vegetable sides and salads, which will frequently have an egg or lardons), but it's always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       We've tried things from every section of their menu and have never been disappointed (well, I didn't like their collards, but I'm from Kentucky. END
BEGIN NOW       The kale, on the other hand, is always amazing). END
BEGIN NOW     The beer: excellent selection of mostly local breweries. END
BEGIN NOW       They generally have good prices ($5-$6, though watch out for the expensive Rare Barrel offerings), as well as a nice balance of beer styles, ranging from pilsners to Belgian Quadrupels, and thankfully not too many IPAs. END
BEGIN NOW     The service: we've had one or two servers who weren't on the ball, but the regular staff is fabulous, friendly, and knowledgeable about their beers. END
BEGIN NOW       I love that the owners are typically around, pitching in. END
BEGIN NOW       They're really friendly if you get the chance to talk to them. END
BEGIN NOW     The cons?  It can get loud at times, but that shouldn't be an issue if you go earlier in the evening. END
BEGIN NOW       But that's a pretty minor drawback when everything else is so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Just. END
BEGIN NOW      meh. END
BEGIN NOW      Pros: Big beer selectionInteresting menuCool vibeDecent foodCons:HORRIBLE service (waited 2 hours)Overpriced for what you getLoudI wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW      It definitely wasn't worth the $90+ dollars my husband I spent on a few drinks, an appetizer, and one entree. END
BEGIN NOW     I LOVE the food and the beer list at Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW      The service has always been good to above average in terms of speed, attentiveness and product knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW      The house made sausages are great, the schnitzel great, the fried chicken so plump and juicy. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer list has many styles from many great big and small California craft breweries. END
BEGIN NOW      I would say there beer list rivals any beer hall in Oakland including the Good Hop, Beer Rev and Cato's. END
BEGIN NOW      HOWEVER, they were spendy, $14 for a bratwurst, when I first started going there 1 year ago and now they are $17. END
BEGIN NOW      They are served with  some homemade chips and a small pile of pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW      Hog's like everything else in "up and coming" Oakland is darned expensive for modest portions. END
BEGIN NOW      Beers have gone up $2/pint as well. END
BEGIN NOW       I get they have high rent, need to pay employees a living wage and nothing is getting cheaper but my sense is these trendy dining houses are going for it because their clientele will pay whatever they try to charge at a cool place. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll miss you, Hogs, but $17 bucks for a fancy hot dog and $7. END
BEGIN NOW     50 for a pint of IPA isn't a good value. END
BEGIN NOW      4 stars for beer and food, 4 stars for service and atmosphere, 2 stars for value. END
BEGIN NOW      Average 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Hip neighborhood joint, with the usual trendy, expensive spin. END
BEGIN NOW      I did enjoy the food, (yum!), and the beer, (good beer menu selection). END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give the place 4 stars, but the value is lacking. END
BEGIN NOW      $23. END
BEGIN NOW     47 for a beer ($5. END
BEGIN NOW     50), a side of bacon ($6?!) and a Brussel Sprout salad with bacon bits &amp; one egg ($10?!). END
BEGIN NOW      It's too expensive to make it a regular stop. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends and I had a good time. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd go back. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome if you like beer, which we do. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, beer + meat = amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      Get the meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW      Nice atmosphere, a beer hall, kinda romantical, actually. END
BEGIN NOW      Bummer? The service. END
BEGIN NOW      Awkward, lackluster. END
BEGIN NOW       Although the server didn't really eat meat, they also didn't seem interested in the food or beer. END
BEGIN NOW      No recommendations or knowledge about either. END
BEGIN NOW      Which is fine - I believe I was far more excited, and we can both ride that wave. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, the hostess was strange. END
BEGIN NOW      If I worked there I'd own it  - its easy to make service industry customers who came to get drunk and spend money happy. END
BEGIN NOW       At least at my job it is. END
BEGIN NOW      This place has so much potential - can you imagine if the service was at the very least  - engaging? It has a casual vibe, but once you see the prices you'll be looking for some engagement, I promise you. END
BEGIN NOW      Some other random cute staff would come by and be nice and fill water and I was grateful. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer float is small, but very good. END
BEGIN NOW     super excited about this addition to the 40th/broadway area. END
BEGIN NOW      the service, the foods, the beer selection(!), the ambiance, the space, everything gets an A+!we got sat along the bar that is built around the perimeter of the pub, facing out onto 40th, and we had no complaints. END
BEGIN NOW      our server was so on top of it, it actually took me by surprise. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm just not used to someone checking in every 10 minutes, but this is what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW      we were not of want of anything. END
BEGIN NOW      from water to new beers, she was there to make sure we had what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW      and the place was packed. END
BEGIN NOW      other highlights - the house made pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW      GET ONE. END
BEGIN NOW      the music was perfect, not too loud, but just loud enough that I picked up on one of my fave bands of all time - pavement, then some sonic youth, plus some other 90's-ish indie rock that I was definitely digging. END
BEGIN NOW      parking as others have mentioned is a breeze. END
BEGIN NOW      and it's also just a block or two down from the local record shop (1,2,3,4 go records), the cool mens shop - Pine &amp; Elder, etc. END
BEGIN NOW      so you can get your shop on beforehand if you so choose. END
BEGIN NOW      finally, I just need to add that I was more than just a little excited about their beer offerings. END
BEGIN NOW      and I'm not even a huge beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW      the two that I tried - a dark chocolatey number  (coffee &amp; cigarettes by CellarMaker) and a local herbal beer that came recommended (a style I never even knew existed but one that I'm kinda dying to sample again!) completely blew me away. END
BEGIN NOW      this is the stuff I expect from a beer institution like Trappist but not from the new neighborhood pub. END
BEGIN NOW      yet, hog's is the spot I have a hankering to return to. END
BEGIN NOW      asap. END
BEGIN NOW      stop by before there's a line out the door. END
BEGIN NOW      it's only a matter of time!. END
BEGIN NOW     It was really tasty! I was very impressed with the beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW      If I wasn't the one that drove I swear I would have tried at least 5 on the list. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend and I split two of the sausage sandwiches and both were very good. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is very hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a shuffleboard in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      The seating is bench style where you'll be seated at a long table, possibly next to really obnoxious people that you have to just try to ignore and talk over and try not to look at and throw death stares over. END
BEGIN NOW      (If I had that 5th beer I'm sure I would have become best friends with them. END
BEGIN NOW     ). END
BEGIN NOW     We feel happy to report we live only ten minutes away and can return repeatedly with no effort. END
BEGIN NOW      A creative menu with fabulous execution, we have enjoyed everything we have ordered. END
BEGIN NOW       The salads and starters are great. END
BEGIN NOW      We loved their version of a Caesar salad. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausages are fabulous with homemade chips and slaw, yummy. END
BEGIN NOW      Their skirt steak and pork chops are incredible. END
BEGIN NOW       Let's not forget a large on tap beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW        Marvelous find. END
BEGIN NOW     First met Tim as he was sourcing his ingredients from local farmers markets, a year ago. END
BEGIN NOW       I still see him there today. END
BEGIN NOW          Tonight was my first night to visit and eat, and I was not disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW       I tried two starters, a salad and two of the sausage sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW       I could go on and on to say how the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sausages burst with complex but not overwhelming flavors, and lard fried chips were crisp and light. END
BEGIN NOW        But I won't, and just say that they have a large array of detailed local beers, and they craft their food with thought, care and precision from farm to fork. END
BEGIN NOW         Yum!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are looking for a good heavy meal and unique beer in Oakland, the Hog's Apothecary is the place to be. END
BEGIN NOW       Its a small neighborhood restaurant, that has an industrial tap house feel. END
BEGIN NOW       The staff was friendly and service was great. END
BEGIN NOW       I would not say the service was particularly fast or slow, but servers were attentive despite how busy the restaurant was. END
BEGIN NOW      I really enjoyed the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW       It seemed to feature mostly small local breweries (many I had never even heard of). END
BEGIN NOW       The variety of the beer selection was great and everything we tried was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW       I love trying new beer, especially from small California breweries, and I loved that this restaurant offered a wide variety of choices. END
BEGIN NOW      The restaurant does take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW      They seem to be busy while we were there so if you can get a reservation I recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW       However (according to the website, only some of the restaurant can be reserved, so they also take plenty of walk-ins). END
BEGIN NOW       There are two TVs above the bar area, so If you are hoping to catch a game on TV they have you covered. END
BEGIN NOW      Our food was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      All of the small bites were great. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel was my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW      That alone could have been my meal. END
BEGIN NOW       The spicy mustard was GREAT, but spicy!! If you love horseradish you will LOVE this mustard (and its perfect with the buttery flavor of the pretzel). END
BEGIN NOW       I had the Titanic salad. END
BEGIN NOW       It was great and plenty of food for a main meal. END
BEGIN NOW       My husband had half dozen oysters and ribs and he had nothing but positives to say about that. END
BEGIN NOW       My only criticism about the experience was that the restaurant was very warm inside. END
BEGIN NOW       The windows were open but it didn't seem to provide much airflow. END
BEGIN NOW      Its a small space, so with the kitchen cooking and a full restaurant it can become uncomfortably warm. END
BEGIN NOW       Overall, great beer, yummy food and nice people. END
BEGIN NOW       We will definitely go back. END
BEGIN NOW     Pros:  fast and friendly service           Food is hearty and good           Good beer selectionCons: food is very heavy . END
BEGIN NOW     but it's good. END
BEGIN NOW     First time dining here today. END
BEGIN NOW       Had reservations for Mother's Day. END
BEGIN NOW       We were seated quickly, and then it was almost 20 minutes before our waiter showed up. END
BEGIN NOW       I had been looking around, with pleading eyes, hoping maybe someone could take the time to get a mimosa started for a mom. END
BEGIN NOW       But no. END
BEGIN NOW       No water, nothing. END
BEGIN NOW       The place was still half empty. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was really good though. END
BEGIN NOW     My son ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits were kind of drowned in the gravy, so my son wasn't eating them. END
BEGIN NOW       I asked if he could have a dry biscuit and they said sure no problem. END
BEGIN NOW       Of course surprise when the bill came- they just had to charge us the $5 for the dry biscuit- which was about 15 cents of ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW       If they had warned us at the time they they weren't simply trying to help a customer be satisfied with their meal, and would be charging us, maybe I would not have been so annoyed. END
BEGIN NOW       But between the 20 minute wait for service and the nickel and diming, it left me not looking forward to a return. END
BEGIN NOW     If you care nothing about service, this place will be just fine. END
BEGIN NOW     Visited today 5. END
BEGIN NOW     4. END
BEGIN NOW     16 I was working from home today and my friend stopped by to visit me. END
BEGIN NOW      We got really hungry and decided to be adventurous and try a new place. END
BEGIN NOW      The hog's apothecary has been on my list for quite some time now. END
BEGIN NOW      I bookmarked it for their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW      It was pretty empty for a Wednesday at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess it's to be expected. END
BEGIN NOW      Sadly, they didn't have the corn dog offered today at lunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I decided to get the trail park boy. END
BEGIN NOW      Their bread is good! The mortadella was new to me. END
BEGIN NOW      I liked it, a bit too salty. END
BEGIN NOW      Actually salt was a big problem with our meal here. END
BEGIN NOW      We share the supernova appetizer/starter. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a mixed green beet salad with herb crème fraîche. END
BEGIN NOW      It was so incredibly SALTY. END
BEGIN NOW      We kind of forced ourselves to eat it when we honestly should've just sent it back or just stopped eating it. END
BEGIN NOW      The only thing good about the salad was the toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW      My side salad that came with my sandwich was also wayyyy to salty. END
BEGIN NOW      I didn't even try to eat it. END
BEGIN NOW      We drank two jugs of water while we were there. END
BEGIN NOW      This place was pretty disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW      /: I wouldn't come back here unless it was to try their corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Excellent experience at this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Communal seating, sports TVs, great service, and gourmet artisan food. END
BEGIN NOW      Their products are quality, and so even though they're pricey, they are decently portioned. END
BEGIN NOW      They change their menu every day, so that's exciting. END
BEGIN NOW     Fun place in Oakland! I came here for dinner with friends after a day of drinking our way through Napa. END
BEGIN NOW     Outside, you'll be impressed with the big clean windows and inside, you'll find community tables and a menu with lots of beers. END
BEGIN NOW     and a surprising amount of hotdogs. END
BEGIN NOW      Most of my group went the hotdog route but I opted for the "Pride of Castroville" which was delicious with juicy artichokes. END
BEGIN NOW      Fun service, chill atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW     Lively, quality gastropub that's helping to put the area around 40th Street and Broadway on the map as a new dining corridor in Oakland, with a feel and identity that's distinct from gentrified Piedmont Avenue not far away. END
BEGIN NOW     The first things you notice are the tremendous craft beer selection and the meat/pork-heavy menu. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the beer, the selection is quite extensive and although it features mostly craft brews, it looks like it's been curated to be very comprehensive across all major styles. END
BEGIN NOW      Moreover, if you have any questions about any single beer item, you could ask for a little taste, or you could ask for advice on what pairs well with certain dishes on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     And as for the menu, it is quite meat-heavy (although I assume some items may be vegetarian-friendly or can be made so). END
BEGIN NOW      While items like sausages might sound steep at around $13, the portion size is tremendous, and the case of the "Got Seoul" sausage that they offered recently, it comes topped uniquely with Asian ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      There are even meatier, more substantial entrees available too, all with whimsical names to them. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything is so meaty and delicious, you'll be "mmm"-ing with approval throughout the meal. END
BEGIN NOW     The overall atmosphere is quite friendly and festive, with lots of communal seating, and the place can be packed most of the time. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is also knowledgeable and friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      Chalk up another win for the 40th Street area and for the Oakland dining scene. END
BEGIN NOW     Your typical hipster joint. END
BEGIN NOW      Bearded men, beer, beer snacks made in-house, pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW     Crater Lake Root Beer was delish. END
BEGIN NOW      Served in a metal cup with perfectly square ice cubes that don't get in the way, it has a refreshing but light sassafras taste. END
BEGIN NOW      It's $5 for about 10 oz. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretzel was pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW      The mustard was more like wasabi pretending to be mustard. END
BEGIN NOW      The malted mayo was brown mayo. END
BEGIN NOW     The space is pretty comfortable but service was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      No one came to our table for quite a while until we asked. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Hangar steak and eggs were perfectly rare and runny (respectively) and biscuits with friend chicken add-on was gooey and juicy (respectively)Draught iced coffee was strong without being overly bitter and creamy smooth cream. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was quick and attentive and just as hipster as one would expect. END
BEGIN NOW     A happy find in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       Interesting selection of beers and tasty food. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the New York Reuben sandwich and was very satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW       The pastrami is almost shredded, which worked fine, and the flavor was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW       Husband had the meatball sandwich and enjoyed it tremendously. END
BEGIN NOW       Freshly made potato chips were perfectly cooked. END
BEGIN NOW       We will happily go back anytime. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a very difficult place to decide whether it's a 3 or a 5 star. END
BEGIN NOW      I opted for 4 stars, and here's why. END
BEGIN NOW      The ambiance is beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW      The lighting is low and glowing, and extremely inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      The overall setup of this restaurant is well thought out. END
BEGIN NOW      And they have a pretty decent selection of beer on tap; different local breweries with brief descriptions. END
BEGIN NOW      Their food is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a bit pricey for my wallet, but that's with the understanding the local (sustainable) farmers provide produce and meat. END
BEGIN NOW      And it's good. END
BEGIN NOW      Just beyond my budget for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW      I have a pretty decent job and all, but this is Oakland after all, and $25 entrees, no matter how high the quality of food, is just not within my budget of reasonable spending for a single entree, not including drinks, not including  my partner  or her  choice of food and beverage. END
BEGIN NOW      I will probably just stick to going there for some booze. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartenders are great, the servers are somewhere between mediocre and great, and overall this business seems to have a lot of pride and it presents itself well. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely worth stopping by for a beer and scoping things out. END
BEGIN NOW      It's very inviting. END
BEGIN NOW     ** honorable mention, this is with respect to Jack R review. END
BEGIN NOW      Just wanted to make the argument that Jack's review is wildly inappropriate. END
BEGIN NOW      Not only is it borderline chauvinistic with his constant mention of how attractive the waitress was, but it's inappropriate with respect to how his failure to order left the waitress to awkwardly make suggestions and order food for him, that he later, somehow, "realized" he didn't know what she had ordered, and therefore he did not like it. END
BEGIN NOW      Went on to joke about how his friend nearly pushed the waitress into his lap, then complained about the food again. END
BEGIN NOW      You're a douche, Jack. END
BEGIN NOW      I think you should take your review down. END
BEGIN NOW      **. END
BEGIN NOW     My girlfriend and I went on a double date with two of our friends, and we had dinner at The Hog's Apothecary. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd. END
BEGIN NOW      This restaurant has communal tables which is something that I absolutely disdain. END
BEGIN NOW      As someone who has a busy schedule and is in a long distance relationship, my time with my girlfriend, my friends, and my family is precious to me. END
BEGIN NOW      When I finally get the time to spend with my self-selected company, I hate having to shout over strangers to avoid being drowned out by their own conversations. END
BEGIN NOW      That being said, the communal tables at Hog's were not nearly as cramped as the ones at Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW      You still have to do a lot of yelling though. END
BEGIN NOW      The hard wooden benches were pretty uncomfortable too. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything else about the restaurant was really great though. END
BEGIN NOW      They offer a preponderance of great local and semi-local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the Buddha's Hand IPA from Berryessa Brewing in Winters, CA, and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      It was not overly bitter and had a pleasant citrus taste from the Buddha's hand. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone else enjoyed their beers as well. END
BEGIN NOW     My girlfriend and I started our meal with a soft pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel had a rich, brown skin and was light and airy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I really enjoyed the spicy mustard dipping sauce that came with the pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The heat from the mustard hits you right in the sinuses (in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW     For our meal, we shared the corn dog and the Jamaican Me Crazy sausage. END
BEGIN NOW     Corn dog: Easily one of the best (non-State Fair) corn dogs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW      However, I feel like corn dogs are kind of like donuts. END
BEGIN NOW      Awful ones are still pretty good, and even the best version with the best possible ingredients is only a few times better than the average ones. END
BEGIN NOW      Jamaican Me Crazy: The sausage was tasty, although the jerk seasoning could have been a little more bold. END
BEGIN NOW      I only tasted faint traces of allspice. END
BEGIN NOW      The bun pillow-soft and provided a textural contrast to the pop I would get when biting into the casing of the sausage. END
BEGIN NOW      The potato chips were tasty too. END
BEGIN NOW      While both items were really good, they do seem a little overpriced for what they are. END
BEGIN NOW     Our service was good, although there was some redundancy between the servers. END
BEGIN NOW      Several different people came around to take our orders and this led to some confusion when my girlfriend ordered a second beer and two of the servers mistakenly thought that the other one would get the beer. END
BEGIN NOW      They got it right eventually though. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall, I like The Hog's Apothecary and would come back another time for beer and a corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Every time I pass by Hog's Apothecary, it's filled to the brim with customers. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu is filled with (overpriced) sausage options. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess it's their specialty, but no way in hell I am buying into gourmet hotdogs prices anymore. END
BEGIN NOW      I already think Rosamunde and Wurstkuche in LA are overhyped and overpriced so $12+ for a dog? I really don't think so. END
BEGIN NOW     Instead, I tried out the brunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW      At first look, everything is pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW      The servers are nice, the interior is open with long communal tables, and they have an extensive "hipster" beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm on a Belgian kick lately for I get the two Belgian beers and they are both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      After we ordered the food, about 45 minutes have passed and we are already close to finishing our second beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The service is painfully slow. END
BEGIN NOW      In fact, I saw some other tables that came in after us getting their food first. END
BEGIN NOW      What's up with that?They see us get a bit antsy and assure us our food is coming out. END
BEGIN NOW      I receive my French Monsieur which is good, with a nice kick of Horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW      I also try the Apothecary Benedict and must admit, the house made ham is quite good. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything tastes pretty good but they are all pretty much heart attacks on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is definitely better than average but not enough to make me keep wanting to come back. END
BEGIN NOW      The problem with this place, and a bunch of other new hipster joints in Oakland, is that everything is "artisanal" but that doesn't mean it necessarily makes everything taste better nor does it justify the stiff prices. END
BEGIN NOW      There are too many places in Oakland which offers a good beer list and hipster food, but it's kind of getting out of hand. END
BEGIN NOW      What's next, $20 sausage made with baby dragon butt and foie gras? I digress but I didn't feel Hog's was a step above any other already existing places. END
BEGIN NOW      That's why I'll give it an A-OK. END
BEGIN NOW     We brought some of our fam here, because I mean it has hog in the name--- why wouldn't we? They only serve beer and wine, so don't expect a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW       The menu is a great mix of stuff to share and entrees. END
BEGIN NOW       We ordered a mix of bar snacks, appetizers and one entree to share. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything was super tasty! The staff was super awesome. END
BEGIN NOW       The one thing that I didn't like was the bench seating (I need a seat back when filling my belly) and there was no where to hang my jacket &amp; purse. END
BEGIN NOW       We will definitely go back here to try more of the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     My wife &amp; I decided to start out 2016 with brunch here today. END
BEGIN NOW       Brunch was quite busy today, so it was good that we made a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW       She started with a mimosa, while I had a pint of hefeweizen (a tough choice, as they have over 25 beers on draft). END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered the chicken and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW       You can get either maple syrup or gravy with this order, but I recommend the syrup. END
BEGIN NOW       The onion waffle and fried chicken are very savory, so the sweetness of the syrup brings a nice balance. END
BEGIN NOW       They use boneless chicken thighs, so you can forgo utensils and just dig in with your bare hands!My wife ordered a benedict, which comes with the house pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW       The egg was cooked perfectly, but the dish (along with the house potatoes) were a little on the salty side. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered a side of bacon to share, which could have been cooked a little longer. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was excellent:  attentive, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW       The place got pretty loud as it got crowded, but it was very festive for the holiday. END
BEGIN NOW     I was out Free Wheeling and I had a fresh Charge on my Ankle Bracelet . END
BEGIN NOW      Today was a good day to eliminate another Book Mark . END
BEGIN NOW     So I rolled to The Hogs Apothecary and Oaktown. END
BEGIN NOW     I rolled up and Parked right across the street . END
BEGIN NOW      No Parking Lot just Street Parking . END
BEGIN NOW     They also have Bike Parking right up front. END
BEGIN NOW      The Cool Thing is the Front Door Handles are Shaped like Giant Meat Cleavers. END
BEGIN NOW     I was Greeted upon Entering and  Grabbed  a Seat at the Bar. END
BEGIN NOW      The Furnishings are Very Sturdy and some of it is from Repurposed Materials very cool. END
BEGIN NOW      Their Bar Menu and Food Menu Change Daily . END
BEGIN NOW      They also Butcher a Whole Pig every Tuesday and they use every part in Meal preparation . END
BEGIN NOW     They have 2 LCD TVs for Sporting Events . END
BEGIN NOW     They also have a Nice Big Open Air Skylight . END
BEGIN NOW     Their Bartenders are a Wealth of Info . END
BEGIN NOW     They have several Micro Brews on Tap. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered a Whippersnapper -Southern English Style Brown Mild Ale . END
BEGIN NOW      I Liked It. END
BEGIN NOW     I then ordered a Chocolypto - Imperial Stout with Oatmeal and Cacao . END
BEGIN NOW      I really like this one it was Rich and Robust . END
BEGIN NOW     My Final Beer was Framboos / Batch 28 -Belgian Style Ale with Raspberries . END
BEGIN NOW      This is a Must Order very Flavorful and Fruity . END
BEGIN NOW     For Dinner I Ordered The Belgian Braise - House Butchered Pork Shoulder braised in Societe ale , heirloom grits , charred radish rapini  braising  jus ,hard herb- bread crumb salsa . END
BEGIN NOW     This was very good the Pork was so Tender it melted in my Mouth . END
BEGIN NOW      Yummy I also ordered a Corn Dog and it Came with House rendered Lard Fried Kennebec Potato Chips and Mixed Pickles . END
BEGIN NOW      This was also good . END
BEGIN NOW     My Servers were Very Nice and Prompt . END
BEGIN NOW      I Paid By Discover Card and Rolled out. END
BEGIN NOW     The fried chicken was piled high and looked scrumptious, but it was raw. END
BEGIN NOW       Not under done, not pink. END
BEGIN NOW       Gelatinously raw. END
BEGIN NOW       I asked that it be removed from the bill which they did, but I was surprised our server didn't seem more alarmed by the fact that raw chicken made it onto the plate. END
BEGIN NOW      This is fine if you like communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW     It took me awhile, but I finally got to try Hog's and for brunch, nonetheless. END
BEGIN NOW     I came on a Saturday and there was a good crowd and we got seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW      I had one of their many beers on tap, though I don't recall which one. END
BEGIN NOW      I went with the Belgian Waffles with Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffles were savory and the fried chicken was a must. END
BEGIN NOW      Otherwise, what's the point? The dish was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      Though the person I was with got the something else, it was very small for the price, even though my dish was a bit pricey as well. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't remember what he got, as it is not on the menu online. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is good and the service is good as well. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a place I would come to every once in a long awhile, but certainly worth a try. END
BEGIN NOW     I live down the street so I always end up here when I can't make a decision on what to eat. END
BEGIN NOW      Great beer selection and excellent food. END
BEGIN NOW      Menu is always changing, which is nice because I can always order something new. END
BEGIN NOW      The bartender told us they base their menu off of what is available that day. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, service has always been super friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I should have ordered the Fried Chicken. END
BEGIN NOW     As good as that dish looked though (and as much as I wanted to try it), I knew I had to order something pork related. END
BEGIN NOW       After all, between Hog's Apothecary's name and their giant pig statue that hovered behind me, it'd practically be sacrilegious not to!  And I am not one to mess with the pork/bacon/pork belly powers that may be (all hail, Bacon!). END
BEGIN NOW     With a menu that is constantly changing, Hog's Apothecary has a lot to offer, even if the day's menu isn't super extensive - roughly a dozen starters and sides, a handful of sausages, and a few different entrées. END
BEGIN NOW       What's more, there's beer and lots of it. END
BEGIN NOW       With over 25 varieties on tap (mostly craft brews), you could even forgo eating and just sample beers all night long. END
BEGIN NOW     -- SPICY PORK CRACKLIN'S. END
BEGIN NOW     $3(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…)These cracklin's are crackin'!  Not only are they borderline addictive, but they really do pack some heat, as every piece is coated with a spicy, mouth-watering seasoning (don't forget the lime!). END
BEGIN NOW       What's more, the portion is quite generous!  A great starter for groups to share. END
BEGIN NOW     -- BOURBON-CHICKEN LIVER PATE. END
BEGIN NOW     $6(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…)Although larger slices of bread would have been nice to spread out all that pate, I'm not definitely not complaining about those giant gobs either!  While every bite was rich and decadent, the taste was also nicely accentuated by the sea salt and the berries. END
BEGIN NOW       If this isn't the best one I've had, it wouldn't be far behind. END
BEGIN NOW     -- SUPERFECTA SAUSAGE SANDWICH - Pork, Rabbit, Chicken, Tim's Brown Ale, Basque Chili &amp; Mild Herbs, Fennel-Onion Braise, Dijon Mustard. END
BEGIN NOW     $14(yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…)The only blemish, but it was a big one. END
BEGIN NOW       I was hopeful for trio of meats in the sausage, but it wasn't even juicy, let alone flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW       Ironically, the braise had the opposite effect, overpowering whatever flavor the meat had with fennel. END
BEGIN NOW       Sadly, besides the chips, the only other thing I enjoyed were the pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW     As underwhelming as my order was, it really was the only "bad" thing about my experience. END
BEGIN NOW       Great food otherwise, an awesome selection of beers, fantastic staff (they let our large party split our bill into smaller tabs), and (relatively) easy parking. END
BEGIN NOW       Plus, with several long tables, Hog's Apothecary is grew for groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW     Also, it's worth noting that the rest of my friends seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit (we all ordered different things), so it wouldn't surprise me if what I had just wasn't one of their better dishes. END
BEGIN NOW       Especially since the starters were really good. END
BEGIN NOW       Rounding up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, but I wonder what might have been if I had only ordered the fried chicken!. END
BEGIN NOW     4. END
BEGIN NOW     5 StarsProsA great variety of draft beers + a flight option Pretzel was easily shareable and well done Fun atmosphereChill staff ConsUmmmm can be pricey depending on your beer choice Overall ThoughtsWhile I enjoyed my experience with the beer I want to come back for the food to see if it can be bumped up that last half star!. END
BEGIN NOW     Order the meatballs (appetizer) and fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      They have tons of beer on tap!  I was in the mood for cider and they had 2 to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW     I can wait to come back here. END
BEGIN NOW       Such a gem!. END
BEGIN NOW     Will not be returning. END
BEGIN NOW      I give the ambiance, environment, resources (food and drink) a mediocre mark, nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW      It was the service I wasn't happy with. END
BEGIN NOW      I have not ever been talked to like that here in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW      I brought my service dog and two friends and was felt less than welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW      Although we did get to sit down for a beer. END
BEGIN NOW      Our waiter, the bartender, Josh H, near beginning of dinner, was kind of an asshole to my friends and I. END
BEGIN NOW      He immediately had a tone upon first approach like he wasn't going to like us, asking about my small dog. END
BEGIN NOW      I told him we had already talked to the manager and were welcomed to sit down. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt like he would have told us to leave. END
BEGIN NOW     Josh came over to my friends and I to get our drink order. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend had a question which left much to be interpreted. END
BEGIN NOW      Instead of helping my friend out he insulted her by remarking "how all over the place" her question was. END
BEGIN NOW      I was floored. END
BEGIN NOW      I later asked for a glass of water. END
BEGIN NOW      Of course I had my dog in my lap away from others, I gave him a chance to drink out of the glass. END
BEGIN NOW      Josh comes out of nowhere and immediately rips the glass out of my hand and scolds me. END
BEGIN NOW      Stroke two. END
BEGIN NOW      We were all ready to leave by this point. END
BEGIN NOW      He returned with a paper cup of water for my dog. END
BEGIN NOW      Sweet? Hardly. END
BEGIN NOW      He also assumed we wanted separate checks when we did not. END
BEGIN NOW      Perhaps he was having a bad day but a first impression is a first impression bud. END
BEGIN NOW      Terrible service. END
BEGIN NOW      Money is tight for most and I wouldn't waste a second try on somewhere that was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW      In order to harvest a community you should probably be more friendly to your locals and their pooches. END
BEGIN NOW      Word spreads fast. END
BEGIN NOW     It's currently SF Beer Week. END
BEGIN NOW       Like, I'm sad that I even had to work at all this week, but I need the money to taste the beer, so here we are. END
BEGIN NOW       Last night, the hubs and I met some good friends at the Hog's Apothecary as they were hosting brews from FiftyFifty Brewing. END
BEGIN NOW       I stalked the menu online, and many of their offerings are meat and pork and sausage and YES. END
BEGIN NOW       Our server was very friendly and very attentive. END
BEGIN NOW        A+Location - near (in?) Temescal in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       I hear this is a notorious hipsterville area. END
BEGIN NOW       No matter, this place is kinda by itself on a corner. END
BEGIN NOW       Walking in, there are picnic tables, so you sit community style with others. END
BEGIN NOW       There was a bar to my right, communal seating in the middle, and bar seating along the left edge. END
BEGIN NOW       I enjoyed the decor, but man, it's loud AF in there. END
BEGIN NOW       We were there in the evening, after 7pm and it wasn't super crowded, but it sounded like it. END
BEGIN NOW      We were fortunate enough to be able to move to a corner booth so we could hear our own conversation. END
BEGIN NOW      Beer - I sampled two beers and shite, I can't remember the name of the FiftyFifty beer. END
BEGIN NOW       It started with an M, if I remember correctly, and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       Winner winner!  The second beer was the German Table Beer, a dark German session with wheat. END
BEGIN NOW       Also delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       I wish it hadn't been a Wednesday night because I would've picked at LEAST three more to try. END
BEGIN NOW       The selection is superb. END
BEGIN NOW       Most of my stars are dedicated to this. END
BEGIN NOW     Food - We ordered the Snack Bar and split among us four. END
BEGIN NOW       I think it's a good bang for your buck. END
BEGIN NOW       You get a HUGE fresh soft pretzel, house made corn nuts, olives, and pork cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything on that platter was delicious, though I feel as though the cracklins were a little stale. END
BEGIN NOW       Could've just been me. END
BEGIN NOW       Hubs and I split the Steph Currywurst. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a good portion for one person. END
BEGIN NOW       That was my bad. END
BEGIN NOW       Not too overwhelming with the curry flavor, with nice pickled onions and chips on the side. END
BEGIN NOW       I left needing something else though. END
BEGIN NOW     I took away a star due to price. END
BEGIN NOW       Yes, the selection is great. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is well thought-out and complementary to the beer list. END
BEGIN NOW       It was pricey for me though (see 1st paragraph). END
BEGIN NOW       A sausage dog, although delicious was $14. END
BEGIN NOW       Overall, still a good place. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd come here again on a semi-full stomach to sample more beer. END
BEGIN NOW     Great brunch place! Friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      Sat at the bar and was served by a cool guy from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW      A wide variety of beer on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      The Royale with Cheese was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The oysters were sweet. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely return to try the pumpkin pie donut holes!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you want a sausage and beer, this is definitely the place to be! Also, if you're a giant hipster, go here:) the quality is excellent, the vibe is trendy (in all it's dark wood and metal accents, with some great pops of corrugated metal at the bar). END
BEGIN NOW     This place is a major thumbs up, bring your friends and it'll be a great time!. END
BEGIN NOW     I am glad I like this place because it's literally across the street from me. END
BEGIN NOW      Be aware it gets PACKED and it's really not the place to just drop in for a beer on the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW      They are really particular where you sit too so aside from the bar you must check in with the host/hostess. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is good however a bit overpriced but the pretzel is huge and very reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW      But you're really coming her for the beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW      Let me say that again-- the beer list is great. END
BEGIN NOW      A ton of time goes into crafting this and you can tell. END
BEGIN NOW      Everyone working there knows a ton and will recommend and let you tastes everything first. END
BEGIN NOW      I miss the little shuffle board they used to have but they totally needed the space given how popular Hog's has become. END
BEGIN NOW      It's great for the neighborhood and I am a big fan. END
BEGIN NOW     Bacon. END
BEGIN NOW      Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      Fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      Millions of local brew on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      This man I know, who I call Lester, not his real name, of course, who is from the great state of Iowa, would have loved this place like hog in mud. END
BEGIN NOW      My pre-race meal. END
BEGIN NOW      It was very children friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I unfortunately was having a discussion with my dining partner about why men always cheat when a young couple with young children sat down. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes it was a communal table style. END
BEGIN NOW      So conversation of controversy could be overheard. END
BEGIN NOW      Though I should not apologize for we have freedom of speech here and plus I know I am right. END
BEGIN NOW      I am the confession chamber to many guy friends who cheat but feel guilty. END
BEGIN NOW     Social commentary aside, this is kind of restaurant that serves the food for the people. END
BEGIN NOW      Basic yet upscale. END
BEGIN NOW      Possibly the best fried chicken with collard greens I have ever eaten. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the pork shoulder with grits, delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Pretzel with two kinds of gourmet mustard, yum. END
BEGIN NOW      But, the most surprising thing was the apple and celery root soup called fruit and root soup. END
BEGIN NOW      Creamy, yes, but also very light and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW      Very girlie dish I think. END
BEGIN NOW      I think the sausages looked great. END
BEGIN NOW      I want to come back to try the local brew. END
BEGIN NOW      Very fashionable. END
BEGIN NOW      This place felt a bit Midwestern and a bit of the South, and slightly Brooklyn. END
BEGIN NOW      Oakland is having a moment. END
BEGIN NOW      I sort of kind of want to share my finds with everyone. END
BEGIN NOW      Time to make some new friends so I can show them how Oaklanders do food. END
BEGIN NOW     We arrived early for our reservation so sat at the bar where we enjoyed some of the amazing beers they have on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      The service and atmosphere was so great we decided to just fine at the bar and what a treat. END
BEGIN NOW      We had bar snacks of olives and spicy pork crackling - both delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Next the chickfritz which made me wish I could cook so well. END
BEGIN NOW      For our main we shared the shrimp and grits - let's say I had to strongly resist licking the plate! Final course was the pumpkin and pretzel donuts with a custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll admit to drinking what was left of the custard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      The donuts themselves were packed with flavor and delightfully moist. END
BEGIN NOW      Finally did I mention the beer selection? Great choice of local small brews, many of which I love so glad Hogs supports them. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Wasn't impressed with the food or service,but the place looks nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW     This area is infested with hipsters and there's nothing to complain about that. END
BEGIN NOW      This restaurant is exactly what this area needed! Craft beer galore. END
BEGIN NOW      This is a more intimate hipster place with cafeteria tables and a bar stools all around (they really want you to start talking to the strangers). END
BEGIN NOW      What I lovvvvveeee is the style and the Devore of this place. END
BEGIN NOW      The plentiful of windows and the high ceilings. END
BEGIN NOW      It really comfortable here. END
BEGIN NOW     They have a huge selection of craft beer all over the east Bay Area as well as out of town beers. END
BEGIN NOW     For now I only tried their hot dogs and pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel was good! Nice and soft and really big enough for two. END
BEGIN NOW      Just AVOID dipping a huge piece into their yellow home made mustard sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      It taste like wasabi. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the hotdog, Jamaican Jerk Off. END
BEGIN NOW      It was ok. END
BEGIN NOW      The Bun broke off cause it was so soft. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausage was good. END
BEGIN NOW      The vegetable they added on top didn't chop off well with the bite. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean it's a hot dog, so simple but they made it so complex that it was hard to understand why. END
BEGIN NOW      I would come back again for the beer for sure. END
BEGIN NOW     Went there again recently and was actually amazed by the food. END
BEGIN NOW      Had mussels and some kind of fabulous salad and vegetable fritter thing. END
BEGIN NOW      It was so fresh, interesting and delicious! (Yes. END
BEGIN NOW      I licked the plate. END
BEGIN NOW     ) Sometimes it's just a matter of respecting your own culinary boundaries and finding the right thing to eat. END
BEGIN NOW      And of course, enjoying The Hog's creative and excellent execution. END
BEGIN NOW     Not sure what's going on but we have been sitting here for 30 minutes! We came in and the waitress took our beer order. END
BEGIN NOW      10 minutes later got our beers! She never came back walked around helping all 10 people in the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      Trying to flag her down no eye contact smh. END
BEGIN NOW      Well at least my dead canary is good. END
BEGIN NOW      oh boy she walked by again!! Check please I guess we can't try the food. END
BEGIN NOW      Let me change it to one star even ride when asking for the check!!. END
BEGIN NOW     I came here during restaurant week and it was pretty busy. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was great and the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW     Excellent beer selection Slowish service, only had maybe 1 or 2 waitstaff for a  busy Saturday night. END
BEGIN NOW      I was going to order the corn app but thankfully I was told it was essentially corn nuts. END
BEGIN NOW     Pistachio mortadella was goodPork  crackling was deliciousShrimp grits were absolutely fantasticCorn dog was extremely dissapointing, the breading fell apart and wasn't crispy or thick enough and the sausage was bleh. END
BEGIN NOW     Sorry, but don't believe the hype. END
BEGIN NOW      Although Hog's is a guiding light for the Temescal gentrification movement, the service is kind of pretentious dudes old timey haircuts and ironic t-shirts, the food is meh, and the vibe is kind of wack. END
BEGIN NOW      Thanks for the $7. END
BEGIN NOW     50 beer and microwaved pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      Wah-wahhhhhh. END
BEGIN NOW     You know, I found the menu very hard to navigate. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe I went at the wrong time of the day? But we were only offered a bar menu and it was not straight forward. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt almost intimidated trying to figure out why we had to de-code it. END
BEGIN NOW      We had to ask the waitress a few times what is what and how we get what we want. END
BEGIN NOW      She seemed at awe why we would ask suchhhh questions but then she served us marinated olives from a MASON jar. END
BEGIN NOW      That was when I figured out we were going to be spending money on cool instead of food, so we nibbled and left. END
BEGIN NOW      I may or may not stick my head in another time, just to see if their regular dinner menu will not be served on burlap or a birds nest. END
BEGIN NOW      The restaurant itself is very pretty though!. END
BEGIN NOW     I went here with two of my friends for Oakland Restaurant Week; unfortunately, we came at dinner and the offer was not available! Bummer! You walk in, and there is a bar, benches (Biergarten status), and stools around the edges. END
BEGIN NOW      The decor was nice and even featured a giant hog. END
BEGIN NOW      FOOD: We got the meatball appetizer and I got the Extras sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW      My friends got the Area 51 and the Kielbasa. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      The food comes with freshly made chips and pickled vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW      The chips were HEAVILY salted that I felt that it was just not good. END
BEGIN NOW      Please hold back on the salt. END
BEGIN NOW      Veggies were fine. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausage combo itself was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW      DRINK:I got a double IPA. END
BEGIN NOW      The place has a lot of beer options and are constantly rotating with choices, so beer options are great here. END
BEGIN NOW      SERVICE: I was pleased with the service. END
BEGIN NOW      Our waitress was attentive, but nothing spectacular, but our food and drinks come out in within a reasonable amount of time. END
BEGIN NOW      Although, she took away our full water pitcher and gave it to another party. END
BEGIN NOW      I was confused, but mistakes like that happen. END
BEGIN NOW      OVERALL:To sum it up, very expensive, which probably is why it's 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      For what I ate, the quality, and all, I don't see how I can justify $14 for a "sandwich" (a hot dog). END
BEGIN NOW      We were content with the place at the end of the night, but believed the price and quality disparity was too big. END
BEGIN NOW     I changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW      (after my last visit)Smarmy host. END
BEGIN NOW      Over priced food. END
BEGIN NOW      Yacky, pretentious &amp; droning hipster wannabes. END
BEGIN NOW      It's downright annoying. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not going back. END
BEGIN NOW      'tis a shame. END
BEGIN NOW      Nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW      Great beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW       . END
BEGIN NOW     oh well. END
BEGIN NOW     Great place to get a drink, and the food (at least, our pretzels) is great! They have a large variety of beers. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the red flight, everyone else had lighter beers. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer and the pretzels were all amazing!. END
BEGIN NOW     Quick stop for a snack before heading out to a late dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selections were pretty impressive! Decided to try the Hock &amp; Trotter Terrine - could use a bit of seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW      The flavors didn't mix in together as well as we expected it to. END
BEGIN NOW      Still overall satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW     Despite passing by this place several times on my trek to Piedmont, I had never set foot in The Hog's Apothecary until this evening. END
BEGIN NOW      I had always felt a tad bit put off by the name, as I am a strict vee-gan. END
BEGIN NOW      Their menu didn't seem to be very veg-friendly (rather, not at all). END
BEGIN NOW      However, my friend Lindsey (also a veg) brought me here, and I thought it was pretty neat, as far as bars go. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried the Societe beer flight this evening ($10), which featured tantalizing names for each brew: The Harlot, The Debutante, and The Widow. END
BEGIN NOW      All three of the beers hailed from San Diego. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was a touch unfriendly, but I've come to expect that same surliness with hipster locales in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW      The dining area and bar were both pretty jam-packed, so the host placed us, standing, at a counter by the window. END
BEGIN NOW      The server seemed to dislike this placement, but where else were we to go? I think I would have bumped this one up to a 5 if the staff had took initiative and found us a table. END
BEGIN NOW      Even so, at the end of the day, all of the beers I tasted were delicious, and I would definitely return to sample more of their cold beverages. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance here is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer is delicious and food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzels with wasabi mustard sauce really opens your airway and taste so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Been here for lunch and dinner now and it's been great!  The menu is limited but with enough choices and diversity for everyone to be able to find something. END
BEGIN NOW       Extensive beer menu but I dont think liquor. END
BEGIN NOW       Seating is communal on some tables to be ready to rub elbows with a stranger. END
BEGIN NOW       Looking forward to going back as they update their menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Loudest restaurant I've ever been in making the experience uncomfortable right as it began. END
BEGIN NOW       The cracklins were chewy, not really crunchy, and didn't have any pork flavor to it. END
BEGIN NOW       The terrine was too subtle and came on bread which tasted like it was a day old. END
BEGIN NOW       My Versace sausage was one of the better ones I've had, well seasoned and juicy with a good kick, served on a soft bun which tasted kind of like a Hawaiian roll. END
BEGIN NOW      The potato chips were fine but nothing special, reminds me of in-n-out fries which are "more fresh" but also just don't taste as good as other stuff you find. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall a pretty average meal in an unpleasant setting. END
BEGIN NOW     Wow! Literally the best benedict I ever had, and from a gastropub no less. END
BEGIN NOW       The meat was amazing and the egg was perfectly poached. END
BEGIN NOW       Excellent job! And I'm typically someone who is very particular with it comes to breakfast (I have a sous vide at home so it's hard to beat sous vide eggs). END
BEGIN NOW       Plus great beer selection on top of that!. END
BEGIN NOW     Had a nice lunch here with a mimosa and a "Vietnamese" sausage sandwich with an egg on it. END
BEGIN NOW      quite good. END
BEGIN NOW      You sit at communal tables. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe next time we come here for happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW     We came back for dinner to celebrate our 1-year wedding anniversary (dropped in without a reservation) and in almost no time at all, we were seated in the exact same place as our first visit back in July. END
BEGIN NOW      We had the same server, AND she remembered us! Pretty awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The blue cheese stuffed figs are not on the menu currently but they make some damn good steak (with blue cheese BUTTER!!! WOWWWW) and fries. END
BEGIN NOW      I loved looking around the restaurant while we were eating and seeing how the staff all interacted with each other - laughing, talking, and at one point I looked up in time to see someone down half a glass of beer. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't mean to imply they're unprofessional; rather I get the impression that people that work here love being around each other and working together in an environment that they enjoy, which definitely makes for a fun dining experience. END
BEGIN NOW      If we lived closer (and made a bit more money) I'd want to be regulars. END
BEGIN NOW     Seriously guys, if you're ever in the area, skip the crowds waiting outside Homeroom (although I also love that place) and just go about a block up for some of the best dishes in the east bay. END
BEGIN NOW     Brunched here twice and the food has been delectable:Softshell crab Benedict - I snapped that up the moment I saw it, and so glad I did because it wasn't on the menu the next time I went here!  It was just as good I imagined it would be, plus the potatoes on the side were amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     Savory waffle + fried chicken - I had this with both gravy and syrup, and really it should be done no other way. END
BEGIN NOW       The fried chicken was boneless (all the easier to inhale you with, my dear), moist on the inside, crunchy but not greasy on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW       The waffles were cornmeal-y, also with the perfect amount of crispness most becoming of a waffle. END
BEGIN NOW       Have this dipped in syrup, and then the next bite smeared with gravy, then a bite of chicken, and so forth. END
BEGIN NOW       I can guarantee the couple next to you who hasn't gotten their entrees yet will be slightly uncomfortable at you and your spouse's eating moans. END
BEGIN NOW       Service was great. END
BEGIN NOW       I would say in the summer be prepared for a cold drink along with everything else. END
BEGIN NOW     Waltzed in here with a reservation for 2, just in case, on a Sunday morning for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Upon first observation, this place is bright, open and cute!! Community tables for the social people and a few private tables for people like me. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend opted for the Pastrami Benedict with Schmaltz Potatoes and I went for the Fried Chicken and Spring Onion Waffles with Huckleberry Jam. END
BEGIN NOW      Let's not forget the mimosas, a brunch requirement. END
BEGIN NOW      Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      That is all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW      Hands down best chicken and waffles I've had so far. END
BEGIN NOW      And I've had a lot. END
BEGIN NOW      No bones! I'm all about bones and meat handles but you know there be places that give you only skin and bones. END
BEGIN NOW      Just meat baby. END
BEGIN NOW      Crispy on the outside and tender, juicy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm salivating just thinking about it. END
BEGIN NOW      And those schmaltzy potatoes?! I stole them off my friends plate. END
BEGIN NOW      So damn good. END
BEGIN NOW      That flavor! I can't get over this place!. END
BEGIN NOW     This is one of our go-to brunch spots in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection is phenomenal, the food is great and we love the space with beautiful light big community tables. END
BEGIN NOW      Some of our favorites include the French Madame, the schmaltzy potatoes, the Royale with cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is always friendly, great customer service. END
BEGIN NOW     Hipster is probably the best way to describe this place. END
BEGIN NOW      The concept, the staff, the menu. END
BEGIN NOW      This is something that you would expect in Portland - but none of this is necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW     My friend up in Oakland had reached out to me, and while looking at reviews for the Trappist, a mention about the Hog's Apothecary caught my eye. END
BEGIN NOW      Fortunately the place was a few blocks from my friend and close to my sister. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend has wanted to try this place, and I was curious. END
BEGIN NOW     We showed up to standing room only - a good sign. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend put her name down with a 30 minute wait, and we found a space to look over the beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW      Really impressive, local menu. END
BEGIN NOW      Some things I've tried, but there was plenty that I had never even seen before. END
BEGIN NOW      Started with the 1903 Pre-Prohibition Style American Lager, which was delicious, and intelligently the beers got added to the menu tab for when we sat. END
BEGIN NOW     Not even 10 minutes later we got a seat. END
BEGIN NOW      Other than the bar, the place features long tables with benches. END
BEGIN NOW      Herein lies the one of problem I see with this place: getting in and up from these benches if you have a middle seat and they are already packed. END
BEGIN NOW      I eventually maneuvered in, but it wasn't easy. END
BEGIN NOW     The possibly daily-changing menu was confusing to say the least. END
BEGIN NOW      I still have no idea what Arlo Shirks or Olin Browns are. END
BEGIN NOW      I get it, hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      But don't make things difficult on your servers and the patrons - call shit out, like everything else on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Regardless, I went the sausage sandwich route that the person sitting next to me also did: a Darkwing (duck and pork sausage with some kind of delicious greens on top) and the fried grits side. END
BEGIN NOW      The Darkwing was delicious and hearty, the chips very flavorful, as were the white veggie side. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried grits were also delicious, but the sausage was big enough that I barely got a dent into the grits. END
BEGIN NOW     Before leaving my friend and I each ordered one of the daily flights: she went with wheat, I went with hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW      The Daphne was delicious, but definitely more on the crisp summer day variety of hoppy. END
BEGIN NOW     I could definitely see coming back, and if I lived in the area, the beers alone might make this a recurring stop. END
BEGIN NOW      Some of the entrees are a bit on the pricey side, but fortunately there are some cheap options so you don't break the bank. END
BEGIN NOW     Great food and rotating taps. END
BEGIN NOW       The staff is also wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW       I visit often and love their brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW     A certain someone wanted to try this place for over 4 months now. END
BEGIN NOW     Here we are at this place with all the open space in the world, but to only see two communal tables in the middle of the room and bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW       Trying to squeezed us into the edge of the communal table (H-E-L-L to the NO!). END
BEGIN NOW      We opted to wait for the bar stools instead. END
BEGIN NOW     With minimal selections, we nibble on some chickpea fritters and meatballs before scarfing down our Moroccan lambs sandwich and hot dogs. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing spectacular about the food when all you're given was some pickles and potato chips to go along with your meal. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm not looking to return to this place but maybe one day along the line. END
BEGIN NOW      In fairness, their service was on point and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     Solid food, great atmosphere and interesting beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      The pretzel is a must. END
BEGIN NOW      Sausages are good. END
BEGIN NOW      Fried chicken is good. END
BEGIN NOW      Totally worth while. END
BEGIN NOW      Though I dig it it's not a place that's like a total package for me meaning I would suggest it, but I wouldn't go outta my way to go there. END
BEGIN NOW      It is for sure one of the better spots in that few block radius - not that there are many. END
BEGIN NOW     Went "cheap" with the Corn Dog ($8) and asked for a recommendation for the 3 small Charcuterie items. END
BEGIN NOW      The waitress recommended the Pork Terrine ($6). END
BEGIN NOW     The terrine comes with toasted slices of Barkada baguette, whole grain mustard, pickle, and olive (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW      Despite having visible herbs it was pretty bland on it's own and definitely needed the mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW     The Corn Dog was superb. END
BEGIN NOW      It's huge and served with lard-y chips, pickles, ketchup and yellow mustard (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     com/biz_photos/the-…). END
BEGIN NOW      Strong smokey flavor from the hot dog. END
BEGIN NOW      The chips were all crisp, an improvement from my last visit. END
BEGIN NOW     They need to beef up the little skewer you can see on the left side of my picture. END
BEGIN NOW      I first picked the corn dog up with that and it immediately bent and cracked under the weight of the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW     Went to check this place out. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was okay but service was bad. END
BEGIN NOW     Duck was dry. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing special about the fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW      Meatballs were great!!But our server, maybe she was having a bad day, but really inattentive. END
BEGIN NOW       She never came and checked in if I wanted another beer. END
BEGIN NOW      When taking our order she literally left before my friend placed his order. END
BEGIN NOW      She took my order then turned around and left as he was about to place his order. END
BEGIN NOW      He had to track her down and give her his order. END
BEGIN NOW      And she never returned to check how our meals were. END
BEGIN NOW      It became comical but she was not a good server. END
BEGIN NOW      I wasn't impressed enough to return. END
BEGIN NOW      Think it's a lot of hype. END
BEGIN NOW     Here's the thing: the food is sadly only 2-2 and a half stars, but the excellent service bumps it up to three stars. END
BEGIN NOW      1) the fried chicken was covered in gravy. END
BEGIN NOW      Like too much and took away from the crispness. END
BEGIN NOW      No flavor to the batter really and kinda bland. END
BEGIN NOW      Meh. END
BEGIN NOW      2) the corn dog- gf got it and I tried. END
BEGIN NOW      Also just not as good as it looked. END
BEGIN NOW      3) fried pickle appetizers were solid though. END
BEGIN NOW      4) great beer selection I will confirm. END
BEGIN NOW     I was sooo excited to try HA. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm so disappointed that our experience left us irritated &amp; disgusted. END
BEGIN NOW      There was literally 4 other patrons there when we walked in at 5:25pm. END
BEGIN NOW     at 5:30 dinner started &amp; 5 more parties walked in. END
BEGIN NOW     we got outta there at 6pm with NO food order since EVERYONE got service before we did. END
BEGIN NOW      I was appalled no one even stopped by to check how we were doing with our beer that was ordered at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW       Funny enough there was a black guy at the bar that was there before we got there that no one was checking on either!!!! The food smelled so good but they weren't getting another cent from me. END
BEGIN NOW     they went outta their way to avoid making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW       Make sure you look hipster enough if you want any service from Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW     you just messed with the wrong ONE!. END
BEGIN NOW     Super yummi y'all! Best fired chicken I ever had (albeit probably the smallest portion). END
BEGIN NOW      Their Wiener schnitzel was incredible and I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW     This place has an incredible beer list. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selector knows their stuff. END
BEGIN NOW      Always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I live fairly close to this spot so I frequent this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Hogs does not have anything I eat ( because I'm vegan) but the service, ant the staff are great, so I come anyways. END
BEGIN NOW      My man loves their sausages and I just like the place. END
BEGIN NOW      Good beer and great staff and I like the design of the place. END
BEGIN NOW     Was looking forward to trying this place as I like beer and pork, and it's within walking distance to my home. END
BEGIN NOW       Came with a small  group on a very quiet night (maybe 6 or 7 customers besides us), but was underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW      Had a good beer and intended to eat, but was put off by the service. END
BEGIN NOW      Example: When I asked the guy behind the bar if a certain beer was good, rather than a friendly "Yes", and maybe describing it, he just dryly said "Define good". END
BEGIN NOW       Really? You're gonna just throw it back at the customer with two words to prove how cool and indifferent you are?More than one examples of dickish attitude meant we left after one beer each, and a tab that was less than 1/5 of what was likely as we intended to stay for more beers and dinner, but I guess they "won" because they seemed intent on not making us feel welcome and they achieved it. END
BEGIN NOW     In the Yelp listing, it says "Ambience: Hipster" and that's accurate. END
BEGIN NOW       Judging from the snarky/snotty service, it seems they Hog's Apothecary thinks that's a compliment. END
BEGIN NOW      In my experience, even hipsters don't like to think of themselves as such. END
BEGIN NOW      (Are there really people out there who say, "Hipster? I'm there!")This place needs to get over itself and act like they're happy you're there. END
BEGIN NOW       The fact that they don't bother to respond to their Yelp reviews seems to be another example of them thinking they're too cool to care. END
BEGIN NOW     When you see the word "apothecary" in their name, you just know it's gonna be hipster. END
BEGIN NOW       So much so, that I kept feeling like I was in a Portland joint. END
BEGIN NOW       Maybe it was the drizzle outside, maybe the multiple sightings of flannels and beards, whatever it may be, I was down with it. END
BEGIN NOW       This place is simple yet legit. END
BEGIN NOW       A new American Beer Hall is how they deem themselves and I like it. END
BEGIN NOW     Started with a black beer mixed with pinot noir from Moonlight in Santa Rosa and it was super unique. END
BEGIN NOW       Not bad but not something I would want multiples of. END
BEGIN NOW       You can definitely taste the wine. END
BEGIN NOW       Noshed on their bar ready *spicy* pork cracklings and they were incredibly light and sticky on the tooth. END
BEGIN NOW       And spicy was a bit of an understatement, it stung like a mutha. END
BEGIN NOW       I suppose they want you to order another beer. END
BEGIN NOW     A salad of tender butter lettuce, chopped beets, hipster rainbow radishes and a nice blue cheese dressing is a nice starter. END
BEGIN NOW       At $10 it is quite spittable. END
BEGIN NOW     Zsa Zsa $14 is an amazing sausage sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW       A Hungarian style which is like a kielbasa on steroids. END
BEGIN NOW       Don't know if they make their own sausage but this was one helluva meat specimen in tube form. END
BEGIN NOW       It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW       Unique toasted bread, a fresh herb/oil spread and thick cut potato chips. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh I'd grow a hipster beard for this if I could, but I can't, so darn it to hell. END
BEGIN NOW     Hanger Steak $26 was spot on bistro fare. END
BEGIN NOW       Tender bloody meat, blue cheese sauce, sautéed greens and potato gratin. END
BEGIN NOW       Very assertive flavors and if you love beef, this will not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW       Only thing was it came out lukewarm and within a minute it was basically cold. END
BEGIN NOW       But now with a dry hopped steam beer from Petaluma, all was good. END
BEGIN NOW     Like the hood, like the brews, like the staff and like the food. END
BEGIN NOW       What's not to like?!  This place is a total score. END
BEGIN NOW     I am adding an update because I received a note from one of the other bartenders that I have never experienced and he told me to come back when he was working and apologized for the bad experience I had. END
BEGIN NOW     I stopped in late for an after climbing beer and saw that he was behind the bar so I went in. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered a delicious beer, drank my beer and went on my way. END
BEGIN NOW     I was impressed and very pleased by his service and have gone back twice when I see he is working. END
BEGIN NOW      He is definitely the gem of that place and like going in for a late night beer when he is working!. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is excellent. END
BEGIN NOW       The food, unfortunately, is mediocre and overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW       I'd be there more often if the waiters weren't so snotty and on top of you. END
BEGIN NOW       They'll get very pissy if you don't order food, even if it's early evening and the place is barely half full. END
BEGIN NOW     I want to love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I live a block away away and I want to come, all the time, and to love it. END
BEGIN NOW      However, due to the poor service I've received on more than one occasion and the clear lack of vegetarian/vegan options I feel forced to give a less than satisfactory review. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm usually fine with ordering the hot pretzel, which to be fair is awesome, and having one (or two or three) of the amazing beers available, and call it an excellent night. END
BEGIN NOW      However, on more than one occasion, I've experienced snobby and/or snarky service, which I find quite uncool (I've worked in customer service for over 20 years and know what it's like to give and receive genuinely warm, welcoming, and helpful service). END
BEGIN NOW     I'll start with the good-often times I've had great servers who were attentive, polite, and top-notch. END
BEGIN NOW      I've had numerous fantastic beers and beer suggestions and a handful of excellent salads and desserts. END
BEGIN NOW      However, more than once I've come across employees who were were way less than helpful, and at times, snarky. END
BEGIN NOW      Boo. END
BEGIN NOW     Me on a Friday night around 6pm: "Hi, I'd love to grab a quick drink"Hostess (with warmth of of a rock): "There's no room at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW     "Me: "Oh, see there's a spot by the window, can I take that [which they let me have any other night of the week]?"Hostess: "Some people are waiting for those. END
BEGIN NOW     "Ok, I can't have a quick beer in the meantime? You can't say in a friendly tone, 'you're welcome to wait until something opens up. END
BEGIN NOW     ?'Frustrated, I left and decided to go across town where I felt more welcome. END
BEGIN NOW      I drove by about 15 minutes later (on my way to said place a cross town), and there was still no one in the seat I had asked for (I could see from the huge windows) Glad you keep it for them! (I would have been done, paid, and and out of the seat by then). END
BEGIN NOW     My next experience: on a Sunday night in which I sit at the bar then ask the bartender if any of the sides are vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW      His reply: "Have you seen the name of this place? We can always make you a vegetarian plate if you wish. END
BEGIN NOW     " Thanks, but why the need for a snarky opening? I could reply, and did: you are a business in vey hipster neighborhood full of vegans and vegetarians. END
BEGIN NOW      It's unfortunate that you're not more friendly to those diets. END
BEGIN NOW      He has the audacity to debate with me, which is when I start writing this review. END
BEGIN NOW     On a positive note, when I'm done with my beer the seemingly manager apologizes for any negativity and offers to pay for me beer. END
BEGIN NOW      Thanks buddy! You've kept the door open for another chance. END
BEGIN NOW     Give 'en a try if you're there for a full, non-vegetarian dinner. END
BEGIN NOW      You may really like it! And, if they shape up a bit and tune in to their local clientele and the general requests of their customers, I'll be back on a regular basis. END
BEGIN NOW     Great service and awesome food. END
BEGIN NOW      Have to admit that I was a bit weary going here with all the reviews about too cool for school hipster servers and I am happy to report that hipster is the only true adjective. END
BEGIN NOW     We were a group of five plus one baby and they were very accomodating, making sure that we had the right spot where the kiddo wouldn't be knocked over. END
BEGIN NOW     Food was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      We scarfed down the soft pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW       Fried chicken was good but not amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      True to the name, anything with a casing is worth ordering and order one of everything!. END
BEGIN NOW     I think the food is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW       I have been known to be a less than adventurous eater so i must point out that everything I have had has had me in awe. END
BEGIN NOW       Love love the always rotating, fresh craft brew selection and they have a couple wines that are de-lish as well as a sparkling for those not into beer. END
BEGIN NOW     I must comment on the 2 star review:  You went to an establishment practically named "pork incorporated" and were surprised at the lack of vegetarian options?  And they preceded to tell you they are always happy to make a vegetarian friendly dish on order (I've overheard them offer this to people and thought that was very accommodating!) and you are still less than thrilled with their service?  And if the local clientele is not being represented with such an establishment, then why are they packed regularly and why did another butchery restaurant open just up the block?. END
BEGIN NOW     Finally had a chance to try this place out as I don't live in the area. END
BEGIN NOW      What a gem! We tried several items on the menu and all to a dish were superbly thought out, created, plated and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       My favorite by far was the charcuterie . END
BEGIN NOW      all made in house of course. END
BEGIN NOW     Beyond the food, the beer list is extensive and eclectic. END
BEGIN NOW       From what the owners said, constantly rotating as well so I'd encourage frequent visits to sample them all of course. END
BEGIN NOW      They also work directly with breweries rather than through distributors when possible so you know care is taken regarding freshness. END
BEGIN NOW      If I lived closer, I'd own a "mug". END
BEGIN NOW     And the atmosphere! Warm. END
BEGIN NOW      Inviting. END
BEGIN NOW      Family friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Not too loud but still fun and great for groups. END
BEGIN NOW       The staff was very service oriented and the chef/owner is constantly circulating the room and ensuring everyone has a fantastic experience. END
BEGIN NOW     The rapini here is arugalized in-house, and their delicious pea tendrils are wilted to order. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't forget to slather the Yemeni skhug on your quatre epices for that extra kick of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Tl;dr: the menu is unrelentingly pretentious, and using inductive reasoning, my party determined all hot dogs are indistinguishable from one another. END
BEGIN NOW     The Hog's . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW      . END
BEGIN NOW     is a nice addition to the flourishing Beer Garden trend that is finally catching up to the rest of the USA. END
BEGIN NOW       Yet this one the lacks the actual outdoor experience one would expect of a traditional Beer Garden. END
BEGIN NOW       Nevertheless, there are many things to like about this one. END
BEGIN NOW       Well, of course the beer selections are very satisfactory ranging from imports and domestics on tap. END
BEGIN NOW       The food delights wells especially the Terrines or the Hogs Head Cheese and and the Charcuteries. END
BEGIN NOW       Nothing too extraordinary here, but the mains and started complement the beer selection nicely. END
BEGIN NOW       However, avoid the mostly unsparing sides like the Brussels sprouts,  etc. END
BEGIN NOW       More time was put into describing them than preparing them, so theylive on this menu as an afterthought. END
BEGIN NOW       The atmosphere is rustic, modern and pleasing ,but it hard to have a conversation here at the larger tables where you nearly have to yell to be hard. END
BEGIN NOW       So if you want something quieter and more chatty, sit by the windows. END
BEGIN NOW     Good food, great service, but this place is so incredibly overpriced. END
BEGIN NOW       $27 for two tiny pieces of fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW       $16 for a tiny salad?  Totally ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW       But delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm from San Diego and this is my second visit to the Hog. END
BEGIN NOW       Both times I have had an exceptional time!!  The customer service and beer selection are outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW       The first time I was there Nicole took great care of this out-of-towner and I knew I had to go back. END
BEGIN NOW       Megan in the bar was super awesome and she really knew her beer. END
BEGIN NOW       She paired me up with a great beer that I probably couldn't have picked of myself. END
BEGIN NOW       After that, Marie, Alice and Christy took over and things were consistently great from there. END
BEGIN NOW       The rainbow heirloom was too good to describe in words, so you might want to go down there in person and try it for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW       Every time I'm in Oakland Im stopping by for sure. END
BEGIN NOW       Thanks for the extra Burrata guys!!  Keep up the good work!!. END
BEGIN NOW     Returned for breakfast and was thrilled to see the Benedict back on the menu, this time with pastrami. END
BEGIN NOW      Combined with the schmaltzy potatoes it is just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      And as previously mentioned the iced coffee is delicious, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. END
BEGIN NOW     service was ridiculously slow! I swear there was one. END
BEGIN NOW      MAYBE two people working and the place was packed! I had the corn dog and I like mustard but that stuff was gross, wayy to spicyoverall just not my kind of restaurant i would recommend going just for a beer due to the large selection but the service would keep from going even for that. END
BEGIN NOW     This is my friend's favorite spot so we've eaten here 3 times in the last two weeks and a dozen, or more, times over the last 4 months. END
BEGIN NOW       The host and servers are always helpful, knowledgable and accommodating. END
BEGIN NOW       They make most everything in house, so they can tell you about all of the ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW        This has been super helpful over the last few weeks because I'm doing the Whole30 diet that requires I not partake in a whole host of ingredients (including no added sugar to anything). END
BEGIN NOW       I've had the same super awesome server the last 3 times. END
BEGIN NOW       She knows what I need and has been incredibly accommodating and helpful in working with the kitchen to help me eat there. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend enjoys trying different beers and every server we've had has happily help him choose the best bear to go with his meal. END
BEGIN NOW       I'm don't drinker beer but they've even helped me find one or two that I like (before I was doing the Whole30). END
BEGIN NOW     If you're looking for friendly service, good solid food and a great beer selection this is a place you should try. END
BEGIN NOW     Beer selection can't be beat, and a knowledgeable staff to guide you thru it. END
BEGIN NOW       Menu is meat heavy as expected, and isn't approachable for everyone. END
BEGIN NOW       However the flavors are incredible and every meal I've had there has been delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       Great location for MacArthur BART and I'll be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW     The food is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      Large hearty portions, really tasty and comforting. END
BEGIN NOW      Great selection of beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The service however has room for improvement - can never seem to catch the eye of the one server on the floor at 7pm on a Sunday (who whisked away our water bottle in an attempt to refill it, then forgot to return it until we flagged her down to ask about the bottle's whereabouts). END
BEGIN NOW      The squirrely host is no help either - eyes only looking at the silverware he was setting down. END
BEGIN NOW     Have now been to Hog's 3 times, and I have been beyond impressed every time. END
BEGIN NOW      My fancy beer friends are always stoked with the selection of beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      Being more of a wine girl, I really like that selection is as well. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was DELISH! The summer gems salad was fresh and tasty time. END
BEGIN NOW      The heirloom tomatoes were also super tasty, and the Italian Sausage KILLED IT. END
BEGIN NOW      Go to Hogs, go now. END
BEGIN NOW     Got there for a reservation at 7:30 pm were seated at 8:20pCouldn't hear or think beyond the noise and music. END
BEGIN NOW     Fish dish was dry  and bland. END
BEGIN NOW     Man, this place is awesome!! I came here for the first time a couple days ago and just had to go back last night. END
BEGIN NOW      I found out about the Hog when I decided to Yelp for corn dog places around the bay. END
BEGIN NOW      When this place popped up, I bookmarked it and knew that this place was going to be a winner (have you SEEN the pictures of that sucker?!). END
BEGIN NOW      Located on the corner of Shafter and 40th about a block away from Homeroom, this place is a great location for a quick dinner or to catch up with some friends. END
BEGIN NOW      During the visits, my girlfriend and I got to try their kielbasa ("Who's your Basa?"), corn dog, roasted peppers, and delicious as all-hell potato chips (that are fried in their own pig lard! Yes!!). END
BEGIN NOW      The Hog has a hefty beer collection on tap with relatively lesser-known breweries. END
BEGIN NOW      We met up with a friend and all got to try an IPA with wild rice, imperial IPA, several saisons and a couple of stouts. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't recall the exact number of beers that they have on tap, but it's a very impressive number considering some places in the area only serve up about 10. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're coming here for dinner, make sure to either make reservations or be prepared to just sit at the bar, which really isn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW      The music here is BITCHIN, so prepare to eat good food, drink tasty beer, and groove to some dope music. END
BEGIN NOW     Look, I know that as a vegetarian in a place called "Hog's Apothecary" (or "Hog's" anything else for that matter), I have little right to complain about a lack of food options not made from a pig. END
BEGIN NOW       So I'll only note here that if you are a vegetarian (or keep Kosher or Halal), you are not going to find food here for you. END
BEGIN NOW     We only came here for beer anyway, so I'm not holding it against them. END
BEGIN NOW     The ambiance here is cool-- very Oakland hip. END
BEGIN NOW       Lots of beer options, so, there's that. END
BEGIN NOW       Greeter and server and person who finally brought our beers were very nice. END
BEGIN NOW     But I was not that impressed with the beer we had in 2 different flights (so that's 6 different beers--multiple opportunities for good beer), and it took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order once we had sat down. END
BEGIN NOW       We actually gave up we were sitting there so long and finally just went to the bar to order there. END
BEGIN NOW       The place isn't that big and didn't have that many people, but it seems like they didn't have enough servers for the space, and so our nice server lady badly neglected us. END
BEGIN NOW       It's two stars for me on this not because it's a bad place in and of itself but because for Oakland, it's a definite "Meh. END
BEGIN NOW      I've experienced better. END
BEGIN NOW     "  It definitely did not live up to the hype; neither, for me, did it live up to comparisons/experiences/and-mainly-the-beer of Beer Revolution or The Trappist. END
BEGIN NOW     But I'm going to guess that if you like pork with random potentially-not-great-beer that this place is going to be the bee's knees for you. END
BEGIN NOW       Or the pork knees, as it were. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are a beer lover and find yourself in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in here. END
BEGIN NOW      The extensive (mostly local) draft beer list is impressive and is varied enough to keep the whole group happy. END
BEGIN NOW      Our group of 4 started standing by the window while we waited for some seating to open up. END
BEGIN NOW      We then sat at one of the large shared tables in the middle of the restaurant, where we shared a couple bits/starters and two of the house sausages (which are huge). END
BEGIN NOW      Great/lively ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW     Sorry guys! Have always loved the food and amazing draft list but. END
BEGIN NOW      Chill out on the rules. END
BEGIN NOW      The last three times we've been there our experience has been soured by weird overstepping of bar/seating arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW      I've invited multiple guests who've felt snubbed by this. END
BEGIN NOW      I. END
BEGIN NOW     e. END
BEGIN NOW      tonight for my birthday after work our table was approached and I was told we were expected to spend more money on food not just drinks and would have been sat somewhere different. END
BEGIN NOW      This was an odd and somewhat rude admission in light of each person ordering over $30 in drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      I appreciate the attempt to keep the most efficient flow going through the restaurant but the second your patrons feel like pigs led through a feeding trough, you've lost an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't drink beer often but I had a fun time experimenting with the beer menu and having our waitress pick out drinks for me based on my preferences. END
BEGIN NOW       The Harlot (a Belgian pale ale) was my favorite, and given that I overheard a few other parties ordering it, my sense is that it's a pretty popular choice. END
BEGIN NOW     I enjoyed everything we ordered (pork cracklins, meatballs, summer bean ragout and mixed grill) except for the corn dog. END
BEGIN NOW       The hot dog tasted overly smokey and burnt to the point where I couldn't really taste the cornbread. END
BEGIN NOW       This was highly disappointing because I love corn dogs, but I still recommend coming here for the other dishes, beer selection and attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW     After a rocky first visit (nothing to do with the food), I'm now a HUGE HOG FAN. END
BEGIN NOW      The cod fritters were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      The fried chicken rocked our world. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was charming and I really appreciated the owners reaching out. END
BEGIN NOW      They've totally solved any service problem they had. END
BEGIN NOW     Food:Spicy Pork Cracklin's - Don't get it, it's not very good. END
BEGIN NOW       It doesn't taste like "real" cracklins. END
BEGIN NOW     Belgian-Braised Pork Shoulder - This is a winner. END
BEGIN NOW       For $27, you make the value proposition on this one. END
BEGIN NOW     Choucroute Garnie - It's exactly what it is albeit I was expecting more meat. END
BEGIN NOW       I think there were 4 meat selections and more saurkraut. END
BEGIN NOW       A great plus is that one of the meats is their duck, which is DELISH!  If I compare it to others that I've tried, this lands on the bottom somewhere (That just means I've experienced tons of kick-ass Choucroute Garnie in my life). END
BEGIN NOW     Beer:Yeast and Hops Flights - All good. END
BEGIN NOW       This place has a great selection of beers and if they curate it as they described, extra kudos. END
BEGIN NOW     Lowdown:I'll probably go back for the beer and the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW       The food and area, not so much. END
BEGIN NOW       I would be here often if I lived in the neighborhood, that's how much I liked my experience. END
BEGIN NOW       Some people will say that the food is over-priced, I can see that argument. END
BEGIN NOW     Recommendation:MAKE A RESERVATION. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the ambience annnnd it's in my 'hood. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm going in a hike tomorrow so I wanted something hefty even though I am currently sans meat. END
BEGIN NOW      So I ordered the Gem &amp; Jewels salad along with the Soft Pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      Sooooooo good. END
BEGIN NOW      Omg, this salad. END
BEGIN NOW      For reals. END
BEGIN NOW      Not playing. END
BEGIN NOW      The softness of gem lettuce, the sweetness of the persimmon, the tang of the pomegranate cut with the slight acidic tang of the crème fraiche dressing. END
BEGIN NOW      but y'all don't hear me though. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm sure many have waxed poetic about the pretzel so I'll just say, order it. END
BEGIN NOW      Their beer menu is extensive and the staff is very welcoming. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered one of the sausage combos and it was awesome. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausage was made and cooked perfectly, and the fixings, while not terribly appetizing to look at, were perfect along with the bun. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection is great and I can always find something new to try. END
BEGIN NOW      Despite being busy, service was quick on everything and the manager was also helping out and very responsive. END
BEGIN NOW     I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Their detail to their house made food,  fine local beers and wine is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      The corn dog is the best you'll ever have. END
BEGIN NOW      It gets busy and some might say somewhat pricey, but well worth all of it! I've been here several times since they've opened and am always impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      Thank goodness for fine food in Oakland!PS- they just started doing take-out; I cannot wait to eat a corn dog in bed. END
BEGIN NOW      Yum. END
BEGIN NOW     This is a cool hipster place - love the vibe here. END
BEGIN NOW       If you like beer, it is a must. END
BEGIN NOW       I am not a drinker but friends enjoyed it here. END
BEGIN NOW       The hostess was very friendly to the wait staff. END
BEGIN NOW       This is a place to share food and chat with friends. END
BEGIN NOW       It does get kinda loud in here and you need to raise your voice to talk at times. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is good. END
BEGIN NOW     we shared 2 sampler appetizer plate and an entree. END
BEGIN NOW       It was a good taste of all kinds of pork. END
BEGIN NOW       The portions were good. END
BEGIN NOW     not too small and too overly large. END
BEGIN NOW     good size. END
BEGIN NOW       The prices are decent. END
BEGIN NOW       It is nice to have a gastropub in temescal area. END
BEGIN NOW       With home run down the block and blue bottle opening near by, I am glad this neighborhood is up and coming with great eats. END
BEGIN NOW     This is an awesome place for beer lovers - they just have an amazing selection of local beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      They also have a selection of ciders, which I tend to order. END
BEGIN NOW      Usually you can grab a seat at the communal tables, but you can also make reservations if you have a bigger party. END
BEGIN NOW      I've found the food to be a little disappointing, with very few options for vegetarians be warned!. END
BEGIN NOW     If you are driving to the neighborhood, do NOT leave anything in your car. END
BEGIN NOW      No bags, no cell phone chargers. END
BEGIN NOW       Your car WILL be broken into, and you will not get your stuff back. END
BEGIN NOW     Okay, I swear, it took me a while to choose between 3 or 4 stars - I've seriously been going back and forth for about 5 minutes now! We ordered the mixed grill - I believe it was a mix of 3 different meats (a piece of sausage, pork belly/thickest bacon slab I ever seeeen) and a half of a small tiny bird (I think Cornish game hen??). END
BEGIN NOW     anyways! 'twas delicious and utterly satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW      Full of flavor and goes so gooood with the beer!OH YEAH. END
BEGIN NOW     the beer. END
BEGIN NOW      that's a whole separate story guys. END
BEGIN NOW      this place has a FAT list of brewery-direct beers on tap. END
BEGIN NOW      they are hand-selected and have a variety from all over the west coast. END
BEGIN NOW      In addition, they're pretty knowledgeable on the beers they offer, so when in doubt, just ask for a suggestion. END
BEGIN NOW      Now. END
BEGIN NOW     the reason I gave 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     the pricing. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean. END
BEGIN NOW     really, for a small ramekin of basically what we Americans know as "Corn Nuts" you're gonna charge $3 for less than a handful? AND. END
BEGIN NOW     they're way too hard to chew, they might be better off sticking in a sling-shot and letting a kid have some fun. END
BEGIN NOW      $6 for a regular pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW      The plate we got, Mixed Grill. END
BEGIN NOW     small tiny portions. END
BEGIN NOW     was wrong for 2 of us to share, but THAT small plate was $28 :/  yikes. END
BEGIN NOW     Another reason for not giving 4 stars was the attitude of the staff - mostly the hostess, the guys at the tap, and our specific server. END
BEGIN NOW     so I guess that's the majority. END
BEGIN NOW      they had this attitude that came off as if they were "too cool" or "too hipster" to help out and serve normal people coming from work that just want a good bite and beer. END
BEGIN NOW      definitely felt like they're only welcoming to a certain and specific type of crowd. END
BEGIN NOW     guess you need tats, an old leather jacket and a septum piercing to get the thumbs up for them. END
BEGIN NOW      it's a shame, because I would've gone back for their food and beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW     probably on a pay day since its kinda pricey , HAH!. END
BEGIN NOW     Went by again for an early dinner on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW      No wait right at 5pm, but it seemed to get crowded around 5:45pm. END
BEGIN NOW     This time we had a chance to sample more of the menu and I have to say that I was actually really surprised at how good the food was! I was prepared to support this place based on the fact that it serves good beer and is within walking distance of where I live, but now I can legit say it is worth seeking out. END
BEGIN NOW     We had:- charcuterie sampler of pork rillettes, liver mousse, trotter terrine ($13 for the sampler of three). END
BEGIN NOW      Quality: B+, Adesso is way better. END
BEGIN NOW      Quantity: B, too much of the sides, not quite enough of the main bits, but for $13, it was alright- frisee and arugula salad with grilled peaches and humboldt fog toast ($8 I think?). END
BEGIN NOW      Quality: A+, this was perfectly balanced and well-seasoned and the peaches were ripe and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW      Quantity: B, the toast was kinda ridiculously thinly spread with cheese- rabbit &amp; pork belly salad with onion stuff and herb stuff on it, it came with chips and pickles ($14). END
BEGIN NOW      Quality: A+++++ the sausage was incredible. END
BEGIN NOW      I was really blown away by how good it was. END
BEGIN NOW      Served on a nice soft roll that seemed a bit pretzel-like. END
BEGIN NOW      I've eaten at Rosamunde countless times and I have to say, this sausage blows theirs out of the park. END
BEGIN NOW      Seems like maybe they've addressed the "okra slime" issue for the pickled veggie side because I saw no okra and no slime. END
BEGIN NOW      Quantity: B+ the sausage was decently sized but still for the price. END
BEGIN NOW      B+- side of cheddar grits ($6) Quality: A+ hi I love butter cream and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      yummmmmm Quantity: B. END
BEGIN NOW      come on. END
BEGIN NOW      it's grits. END
BEGIN NOW      you could give us more than 1. END
BEGIN NOW     25 cups for $6. END
BEGIN NOW     I've been here three times. END
BEGIN NOW      Loved it the first two, really disliked it the last. END
BEGIN NOW       They've changed the menu: they used to have a great salad ("visions of spring") which still shows up on their online menu but was no longer on offer last Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW       The salad I had (which was basically the only option) called the "green machine" was a salty, gloppy mess. END
BEGIN NOW       And worst of all, they "ran out" of the soft pretzels, which was 90 percent of our reason for being there. END
BEGIN NOW      At 8 p. END
BEGIN NOW     m. END
BEGIN NOW      on a Saturday night - really??? Our less than helpful server offered us nothing as substitute (some of the potato chips that came with the dinner the people next to us had would have been good to satisfy the salty craving, but we didn't know about them). END
BEGIN NOW       And our platter of three different salumi only had two. END
BEGIN NOW       I guess they "ran out" of the third variety. END
BEGIN NOW       Finally, our "medium rare" ribeye was raw: presumably they "ran out" of time to cook it properly. END
BEGIN NOW     We love Hog's Apothecary- relaxed local vibe- great beer and cider selection - I LOVE the Graviva personally - their albeit more limited wine selection works even with their focus on draft and craft beer- food is sophisticated, interesting and the menu is always changing- service is always top notch - friendly and knowledgeable - they now have added brunch which is awesome :)- to date we have always been able to walk in and get seated - we make reservations about 50% of the time as it can get busy for dinner even early in the dining hour. END
BEGIN NOW     The beer selection is great and fairly priced but the food selection is not. END
BEGIN NOW      Well developed flavor with tragically pretentious ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      It is exactly what you should expect from a hipster joint in piedmont, $23 for a pork chop. END
BEGIN NOW      The meatballs were the best thing on the table. END
BEGIN NOW      Bring your horn rimmed glasses. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff is very knowledgeable and all I need to tell them is a type of beer I like and they find the perfect match for me. END
BEGIN NOW       Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I have not tried the food yet. END
BEGIN NOW     I tried Hog's Apothecary for the second time. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is very good but the service just horrible. END
BEGIN NOW       I arrive famished on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW       Ordered the Clubber. END
BEGIN NOW       Food arrived about 30 minutes later and the waitress once again quickly disappeared after dropping off the food. END
BEGIN NOW        No apology or acknowledgment on the long time to deliver the food. END
BEGIN NOW       No, "Can I get you anything else?"  No follow up with, "Is everything ok?"   Poof - gone. END
BEGIN NOW       She delivered the wrong sandwich to me, though my partner's was correct. END
BEGIN NOW       Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW       It's such a shame since the food and beer is pretty good here, but not good enough to overshadow the down right poor, indifferent service. END
BEGIN NOW       Sorry, not going back. END
BEGIN NOW     When going to the restaurant of a friend for the first time, one prepares themselves to be polite, offering words of praise out of the sense of duty that comes with being friends. END
BEGIN NOW       We caution ourselves not to be harsh or critical and generally keep any negatives quiet. END
BEGIN NOW       After all, they are our friends and we'd expect the same. END
BEGIN NOW     Thank goodness I don't have to keep the negatives to myself. END
BEGIN NOW       as I couldn't find any. END
BEGIN NOW       In fact, to say I was impressed would be an understatement. END
BEGIN NOW     Brad and John have taken what once was a dilapidated laundromat with a seedy past and created a neighborhood gathering spot that is open, airy and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW       I was at first slightly put off by the long tables and benches, as I generally prefer not to share my table with people I don't know, but I came to realize that it promotes conversation between strangers and contributes to the neighborhood feel. END
BEGIN NOW       While the dining area is not huge, the high ceiling with exposed beams and open air skylight make it feel much larger. END
BEGIN NOW       "Hog's" boasts more taps than I could get through in a week. END
BEGIN NOW       They have beers on tap to appeal to any beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW       They also cycle beers in and out to keep the selections new and inviting. END
BEGIN NOW       Now. END
BEGIN NOW      on to the food itself. END
BEGIN NOW       We started out with the warm pretzel for two with cheese sauce and mustard. END
BEGIN NOW      ( One thing you must know before I go further. END
BEGIN NOW       Nearly everything you eat is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW       The mustard, the cheese, the sausage, the kraut. END
BEGIN NOW       the exceptions being the buns and, if memory serves, the pretzel itself. END
BEGIN NOW      )  The pretzel was hot and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       The house made mustard and cheese sauce were the perfect compliment. END
BEGIN NOW       There's just no comparison between jar mustard and mustard made fresh that day. END
BEGIN NOW       For my entree I ordered the schnitzel. END
BEGIN NOW       It's really easy to overcook pork and make it dry. END
BEGIN NOW       Not the case here. END
BEGIN NOW       The breading was light, the pork juicy and while I used my knife at first, I ended up using just my fork as it was so tender. END
BEGIN NOW       The arugula and warm potato salad only served to enhance the succulent pork. END
BEGIN NOW       My dining companions ordered the 'Basa' with kraut and the Devil Bird fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW       I was raised by a German mother who made ( and at 70 still makes ) her own kraut. END
BEGIN NOW      As much as I cannot believe I am saying this, ( Sorry, Mom ) the kraut at Hog's is better. END
BEGIN NOW       especially thrown on top of a juicy and savory sausage with just the right pop from the casing. END
BEGIN NOW       ( Sorry, Mom ) The chicken was juicy and full of flavor, but it's the breading that really takes it over the top. END
BEGIN NOW       It's hard to describe, but there's a slight sweetness to it that, to me, was reminiscent of that first bite of a churro or a Krispy Kreme that immediately makes you want another bite. END
BEGIN NOW       It's difficult NOT to want to clean your plate. END
BEGIN NOW     I do have one regret. END
BEGIN NOW       Only one. END
BEGIN NOW       I didn't try dessert. END
BEGIN NOW       We all surveyed the dessert menu, but after a great beer and amazing food there was just no room. END
BEGIN NOW     I know I am a friend and friends tend to be biased so I encourage you to read other reviews. END
BEGIN NOW       Aside from the small contingent of nay-sayers you will find that the overall rating of 4/5 stars is well earned and well deserved. END
BEGIN NOW       It's worth checking out. END
BEGIN NOW     A little spendy for what you get, but everything we had was great and the atmosphere and service was wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW     We've visited Hog's a few times now. END
BEGIN NOW       Every single time, we've received amazing food and exceptional service. END
BEGIN NOW       We've left with happy bellies and smiles on our faces. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was great, as were the beers. END
BEGIN NOW       Unfortunately, the service was slow. END
BEGIN NOW       Our server was new, and not super attentive or knowledgeable about the menu. END
BEGIN NOW       Hopefully she'll hit her stride. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess my main issue with this place is that it is not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW       They bill themselves as an "American Beer Hall", which to me means:- A large craft beer selection (check)- A good, informal place to gather with friends (nope-though the potential is there)- Maybe some inexpensive pub style food. END
BEGIN NOW       However, when you walk inside, you are greeted by a hostess and added to the list for a seat at one of their community tables or bar stools along the window counters. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is VERY EXPENSIVE for what it is, and the staff projects a major restaurant vibe, but the atmosphere is that of a bar. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm really not sure what is going on here but its not at all what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW     For about a year I anticipated their opening and ended up there on the first night they were open to the public. END
BEGIN NOW       I've been back a few times, and it only seems to have become more restaurant-y. END
BEGIN NOW       One positive thing to say, the beer selection is excellent and the price is right for draft beers. END
BEGIN NOW       That said, It's not easy to get in for just a few beers (especially for more than 1-3 people), so I have ended up passing it up when going out with friends even though I live 3 blocks away. END
BEGIN NOW     I really hope that Hog's will make up its mind, are you an up-scale restaurant or are you a beer hall? Right now you are somewhere in-between and it just isn't working for my demographic at all. END
BEGIN NOW     If you're looking for a spot with tons of (mostly) local beers on tap, this is a great spot to visit. END
BEGIN NOW      Death and Taxes is my favorite beer they have. END
BEGIN NOW      They also have a small selection of wines if beer isn't your thing. END
BEGIN NOW      The Grilled Greens starter I had there was meh. END
BEGIN NOW      It was way too salty for me. END
BEGIN NOW      I wouldn't recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW      However, I heard the corn dog is amazing, i will have to try it next time I'm there. END
BEGIN NOW      The Devilbird (fried chicken on top of some spicy garbanzo beans with chili oil) OMG. END
BEGIN NOW      So delicious and perfectly spicy. END
BEGIN NOW      So buttermilky and crispy! I love the fried chicken there. END
BEGIN NOW      It never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is great there, I've never had any issues with the staff whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW      They're always nice and prompt! Also: be prepared to get a little cozy with other patrons, the seating is picnic table style. END
BEGIN NOW     Great beer selection, corn dog and hot dog were ok but made in house. END
BEGIN NOW      pate, rillette were on point. END
BEGIN NOW      would def come back for some beer and pate. END
BEGIN NOW     Kinda shocking to read reviews about how snobby the wait staff was, I found the service to be very friendly and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the food and beer - YUM. END
BEGIN NOW      The food was so flavorful, with fresh herbs and the sauce on the pork chops was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW      Loved it so much, we asked the waitress if we could have some bread so we could sop up every ounce, because yes, we are hogs. END
BEGIN NOW      The kitchen specially prepared some toast for us so we could lick the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection was good, the menu described the brews well and I was pleased with my selection. END
BEGIN NOW      The interior is pretty cool, but can get loud. END
BEGIN NOW      Looking forward to returning. END
BEGIN NOW     If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would! There food and beer is fantastic! They have an industrial feel to them and sure its a hipster joint but that doesn't detract from the delicious food and beer!Recommendations: 1. END
BEGIN NOW      Butchers coffer. END
BEGIN NOW      Get all three, every time. END
BEGIN NOW      Its worth it2. END
BEGIN NOW      Lil Salty3. END
BEGIN NOW      Any of their sausagesBeer: 1. END
BEGIN NOW      The Butcher 2. END
BEGIN NOW      Tunnel VisionGreat Job guys. END
BEGIN NOW     Only tried the beers here so I can't comment on food. END
BEGIN NOW      There was a great variety of drinks and the bartender was so nice to let me try several until I found a beer I was satisfied with. END
BEGIN NOW      Sucks that its so hard to find a seat here, it seems like they could better maximize their space. END
BEGIN NOW      Also the lighting in here was so dark. END
BEGIN NOW      But overall, another trendy restaurant to hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm a little biased since it's right up my street, but Hog's is a pretty special place. END
BEGIN NOW      The rotating taps, solid food, and ambiance are great. END
BEGIN NOW      Tried their brunch for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. END
BEGIN NOW      Had the pork belly/beef burger and apothecary benedict at our table and both were very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW      They also were open to showing the football game our group wanted to watch. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, a solid four stars, and my go-to neighborhood bar. END
BEGIN NOW      Much, much better reason to come to 40th Street than Homeroom. END
BEGIN NOW     Hot damn. END
BEGIN NOW       We came here for their soft opening, and we've been coming here regularly ever since. END
BEGIN NOW       The food: fantastic, inventive, and there's always something new. END
BEGIN NOW       It tends to be heavy fare (even the vegetable sides and salads, which will frequently have an egg or lardons), but it's always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       We've tried things from every section of their menu and have never been disappointed (well, I didn't like their collards, but I'm from Kentucky. END
BEGIN NOW       The kale, on the other hand, is always amazing). END
BEGIN NOW     The beer: excellent selection of mostly local breweries. END
BEGIN NOW       They generally have good prices ($5-$6, though watch out for the expensive Rare Barrel offerings), as well as a nice balance of beer styles, ranging from pilsners to Belgian Quadrupels, and thankfully not too many IPAs. END
BEGIN NOW     The service: we've had one or two servers who weren't on the ball, but the regular staff is fabulous, friendly, and knowledgeable about their beers. END
BEGIN NOW       I love that the owners are typically around, pitching in. END
BEGIN NOW       They're really friendly if you get the chance to talk to them. END
BEGIN NOW     The cons?  It can get loud at times, but that shouldn't be an issue if you go earlier in the evening. END
BEGIN NOW       But that's a pretty minor drawback when everything else is so good. END
BEGIN NOW     Just. END
BEGIN NOW      meh. END
BEGIN NOW      Pros: Big beer selectionInteresting menuCool vibeDecent foodCons:HORRIBLE service (waited 2 hours)Overpriced for what you getLoudI wouldn't go back. END
BEGIN NOW      It definitely wasn't worth the $90+ dollars my husband I spent on a few drinks, an appetizer, and one entree. END
BEGIN NOW     I LOVE the food and the beer list at Hog's. END
BEGIN NOW      The service has always been good to above average in terms of speed, attentiveness and product knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW      The house made sausages are great, the schnitzel great, the fried chicken so plump and juicy. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer list has many styles from many great big and small California craft breweries. END
BEGIN NOW      I would say there beer list rivals any beer hall in Oakland including the Good Hop, Beer Rev and Cato's. END
BEGIN NOW      HOWEVER, they were spendy, $14 for a bratwurst, when I first started going there 1 year ago and now they are $17. END
BEGIN NOW      They are served with  some homemade chips and a small pile of pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW      Hog's like everything else in "up and coming" Oakland is darned expensive for modest portions. END
BEGIN NOW      Beers have gone up $2/pint as well. END
BEGIN NOW       I get they have high rent, need to pay employees a living wage and nothing is getting cheaper but my sense is these trendy dining houses are going for it because their clientele will pay whatever they try to charge at a cool place. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll miss you, Hogs, but $17 bucks for a fancy hot dog and $7. END
BEGIN NOW     50 for a pint of IPA isn't a good value. END
BEGIN NOW      4 stars for beer and food, 4 stars for service and atmosphere, 2 stars for value. END
BEGIN NOW      Average 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Hip neighborhood joint, with the usual trendy, expensive spin. END
BEGIN NOW      I did enjoy the food, (yum!), and the beer, (good beer menu selection). END
BEGIN NOW      I'd give the place 4 stars, but the value is lacking. END
BEGIN NOW      $23. END
BEGIN NOW     47 for a beer ($5. END
BEGIN NOW     50), a side of bacon ($6?!) and a Brussel Sprout salad with bacon bits &amp; one egg ($10?!). END
BEGIN NOW      It's too expensive to make it a regular stop. END
BEGIN NOW     My friends and I had a good time. END
BEGIN NOW      I'd go back. END
BEGIN NOW     Awesome if you like beer, which we do. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, beer + meat = amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      Get the meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW      Nice atmosphere, a beer hall, kinda romantical, actually. END
BEGIN NOW      Bummer? The service. END
BEGIN NOW      Awkward, lackluster. END
BEGIN NOW       Although the server didn't really eat meat, they also didn't seem interested in the food or beer. END
BEGIN NOW      No recommendations or knowledge about either. END
BEGIN NOW      Which is fine - I believe I was far more excited, and we can both ride that wave. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, the hostess was strange. END
BEGIN NOW      If I worked there I'd own it  - its easy to make service industry customers who came to get drunk and spend money happy. END
BEGIN NOW       At least at my job it is. END
BEGIN NOW      This place has so much potential - can you imagine if the service was at the very least  - engaging? It has a casual vibe, but once you see the prices you'll be looking for some engagement, I promise you. END
BEGIN NOW      Some other random cute staff would come by and be nice and fill water and I was grateful. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer float is small, but very good. END
BEGIN NOW     super excited about this addition to the 40th/broadway area. END
BEGIN NOW      the service, the foods, the beer selection(!), the ambiance, the space, everything gets an A+!we got sat along the bar that is built around the perimeter of the pub, facing out onto 40th, and we had no complaints. END
BEGIN NOW      our server was so on top of it, it actually took me by surprise. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm just not used to someone checking in every 10 minutes, but this is what we experienced. END
BEGIN NOW      we were not of want of anything. END
BEGIN NOW      from water to new beers, she was there to make sure we had what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW      and the place was packed. END
BEGIN NOW      other highlights - the house made pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW      GET ONE. END
BEGIN NOW      the music was perfect, not too loud, but just loud enough that I picked up on one of my fave bands of all time - pavement, then some sonic youth, plus some other 90's-ish indie rock that I was definitely digging. END
BEGIN NOW      parking as others have mentioned is a breeze. END
BEGIN NOW      and it's also just a block or two down from the local record shop (1,2,3,4 go records), the cool mens shop - Pine &amp; Elder, etc. END
BEGIN NOW      so you can get your shop on beforehand if you so choose. END
BEGIN NOW      finally, I just need to add that I was more than just a little excited about their beer offerings. END
BEGIN NOW      and I'm not even a huge beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW      the two that I tried - a dark chocolatey number  (coffee &amp; cigarettes by CellarMaker) and a local herbal beer that came recommended (a style I never even knew existed but one that I'm kinda dying to sample again!) completely blew me away. END
BEGIN NOW      this is the stuff I expect from a beer institution like Trappist but not from the new neighborhood pub. END
BEGIN NOW      yet, hog's is the spot I have a hankering to return to. END
BEGIN NOW      asap. END
BEGIN NOW      stop by before there's a line out the door. END
BEGIN NOW      it's only a matter of time!. END
BEGIN NOW     It was really tasty! I was very impressed with the beer selection. END
BEGIN NOW      If I wasn't the one that drove I swear I would have tried at least 5 on the list. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend and I split two of the sausage sandwiches and both were very good. END
BEGIN NOW      The atmosphere is very hipster. END
BEGIN NOW      They have a shuffleboard in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      The seating is bench style where you'll be seated at a long table, possibly next to really obnoxious people that you have to just try to ignore and talk over and try not to look at and throw death stares over. END
BEGIN NOW      (If I had that 5th beer I'm sure I would have become best friends with them. END
BEGIN NOW     ). END
BEGIN NOW     We feel happy to report we live only ten minutes away and can return repeatedly with no effort. END
BEGIN NOW      A creative menu with fabulous execution, we have enjoyed everything we have ordered. END
BEGIN NOW       The salads and starters are great. END
BEGIN NOW      We loved their version of a Caesar salad. END
BEGIN NOW      The sausages are fabulous with homemade chips and slaw, yummy. END
BEGIN NOW      Their skirt steak and pork chops are incredible. END
BEGIN NOW       Let's not forget a large on tap beer menu. END
BEGIN NOW        Marvelous find. END
BEGIN NOW     First met Tim as he was sourcing his ingredients from local farmers markets, a year ago. END
BEGIN NOW       I still see him there today. END
BEGIN NOW          Tonight was my first night to visit and eat, and I was not disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW       I tried two starters, a salad and two of the sausage sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW       I could go on and on to say how the asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sausages burst with complex but not overwhelming flavors, and lard fried chips were crisp and light. END
BEGIN NOW        But I won't, and just say that they have a large array of detailed local beers, and they craft their food with thought, care and precision from farm to fork. END
BEGIN NOW         Yum!. END
BEGIN NOW     Yummy breakfast food and great atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW       We called ahead of time to see if the back area was open so we could bring our dogs. END
BEGIN NOW       They said yes, but when we got there it was already full. END
BEGIN NOW       We sat in the front with our dogs instead and had a great time. END
BEGIN NOW       They brought out a little bowl of water for them and were unbothered when my dog sniffed her shoe and leg!  I got the waffle with 2 eggs and bacon and thought it was just perfect. END
BEGIN NOW       Go for a relaxed nice breakfast -- can bring your pups!. END
BEGIN NOW     This place seemed like a cool little spot, in a great area too, but I will never return. END
BEGIN NOW      First, the service was terrible! There was only 4 of us, but they acted as though we were a large party. END
BEGIN NOW      Trying to ask for something as simple as a fork was like pulling teeth. END
BEGIN NOW      Once we were finally seated, two of us ordered a coffee drink off the menu, called a Black and White: espresso with vanilla ice cream. END
BEGIN NOW      After asking about coffee drinks multiple times, they were finally brought out as we were finishing our food. END
BEGIN NOW      They were made with really old vanilla ice cream so neither of us could even finish them. END
BEGIN NOW      As far as my food: my eggs were funny (even though I ordered scrambled) and I ended up only eating the potatoes off my plate. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm only giving a star because that's the lowest I can give. END
BEGIN NOW     Had to try the legendary oatmeal pancake here. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, it was huge when it arrived. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes, it tasted SUPER healthy. END
BEGIN NOW      It was like they made some hot oatmeal and then straight fried it. END
BEGIN NOW      I mean, it wasn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW      I finished mine without the blueberry sauce, but my family really didn't like the poor pancake, even with the blueberry sauce ):The other items we ordered were good, but nothing really stood out to us. END
BEGIN NOW     Except for the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW      I love the restroom. END
BEGIN NOW      The sign above the toilet made me really happy I breakfasted here. END
BEGIN NOW     What keeps me coming back you ask? The amazing customer service and how fast the food is served. END
BEGIN NOW      LITERALLY!!I came for weekend brunch with a friend and found this wonderful find on Yelp! We walked in and noticed that the café spot was packed house! Luckily I went to the counter and asked how long the wait was and she assisted me upstairs where there was upstairs seating outside. END
BEGIN NOW      I would have never known they had an outside back area but it's so cute and intimate! (I definitely recommend seating outside). END
BEGIN NOW     Menus are already located on the table so by the time our server came I was ready to order. END
BEGIN NOW      we ordered the:~Eggs A La Justin- Consisted of two medium eggs, avocado, tomato, English muffin and homemade hollandaise sauce $10~Two eggs-Consisted of any style with bacon, grilled potatoes and toast $9Once we ordered the food we literally waited less than 10minutes and we were being served. END
BEGIN NOW      I swear I heard my friend say, "Damn, did the cooks hear our order from the kitchen? This food came out FAST!" haha. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything tasted delicious and the food was VERY filling. END
BEGIN NOW      I was feeling like a stuffed muffin leaving the restaurant! HA! I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a great weekend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      Its small and I am sure it gets busy very quickly so might want to call in to see how long the wait is but however long it is. END
BEGIN NOW     its truly worth it!ENJOY!. END
BEGIN NOW     I work fairly close and thought I would give them a try BC some of my coworkers like their food. END
BEGIN NOW      Ehh not the best, had eggs Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW      Eggs were over cook as was the hollandaise sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      Clumpy, cold on the side in a little container thankfully BC it was completely inedible. END
BEGIN NOW      This would not have been a huge issue for me if there was a large amount of people waiting. END
BEGIN NOW      But there was not, I went in during a really slow time. END
BEGIN NOW      Sad. END
BEGIN NOW      Don't much feel like going back to pay $10 for inedible ,  over cooked cold food. END
BEGIN NOW     My official go to brunch place! Don't let the small space and old decor fool you. END
BEGIN NOW      They do brunch here fast, simple, and most importantly, delicious! I ordered a Blackstone Benedict which came with thick and crispy bacon, a slice of tomato, and of course a perfectly poached egg and a light hollandaise sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      My dish also came with a side of the house potatoes that just needed some hot sauce and ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW      The food came out so fast and I know it was fresh. END
BEGIN NOW      Prices are great too! My dish cost $10 and the service was good too. END
BEGIN NOW      Very nice and attentive servers. END
BEGIN NOW      They had some specials on the board such as Spud-o-Rama which I wish to try next time! Gotta try this little gem!. END
BEGIN NOW     Boyfriend and I decided to grab breakfast before a full day of activities. END
BEGIN NOW       We wanted a place that wasn't too formal, or too quick (like a coffee shop or a cafe where you order at the counter), but small, not to crowded, homey and easy going. END
BEGIN NOW      This was exactly what we were looking for. END
BEGIN NOW     The restaurant is very warm and bright with a lot of sunshine to fill the room. END
BEGIN NOW       Though it is small, there were a couple tables open for us to sit at (we came on a Sunday around 9 am). END
BEGIN NOW      They have an extensive breakfast and lunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW       The items weren't over the top, but simple and delicious sounding. END
BEGIN NOW       It took Boyfriend and I a bit of time to figure out what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW       I decided to get the Wayne's breakfast and Boyfriend got the avocado omelette. END
BEGIN NOW      We started with coffee that was rich and warm. END
BEGIN NOW       Our food came out so quickly, we were surprised. END
BEGIN NOW       Our breakfast was absolutely ideal -- great portions and relatively healthy (as in they don't pour mounds of oil and sauce on the food). END
BEGIN NOW       My oatmeal wheat pancakes came with blueberry sauce that was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       My sunny side up eggs were also cook perfectly with a thin film over the top of the eggs. END
BEGIN NOW      The bacon was really juicy and crispy (if you flicked it, it was stiff not floppy). END
BEGIN NOW      Boyfriends eggs were fluffy and I think they gave him at least half an avocado or more!We were so impressed by this breakfast joint that it will be THE place to go to for breakfast for us. END
BEGIN NOW       The service was very friendly and our food came out very quick. END
BEGIN NOW       PLUS everything was pretty inexpensive. END
BEGIN NOW       It doesn't get better than this. END
BEGIN NOW      What a gem :)Ambiance: 5/5Food: 4. END
BEGIN NOW     5/5Service: 5/5Overall Experience: 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to come here and really enjoy the food, not today. END
BEGIN NOW       My husband asked for eggs over hard and it was over easy. END
BEGIN NOW       Our server's give-a-shit meter was really low. END
BEGIN NOW       My coffee was never refilled and our mugs looked disgusting. END
BEGIN NOW      The Eggs Jacqueline, which was my standby, was watery. END
BEGIN NOW       I was excited to return, but this is the last time I'll eat here. END
BEGIN NOW       You really need to re-examine what you're doing. END
BEGIN NOW       I really liked this place two years ago and something went horribly wrong in the two years since. END
BEGIN NOW     Wow! Best brunch I've had in a long time! Service was prompt and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW      The best mocha and salsa I've ever had (random bests I know)! Eggs Florintine was superb! A little noisy, but it's a small place so that's to be expected. END
BEGIN NOW      Not great for big groups unless you come early and get the big middle table or else be prepared to wait. END
BEGIN NOW      Other than that, highly recommend!. END
BEGIN NOW     I hate to say it. END
BEGIN NOW      but I was a little disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      Oh my gosh. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't want to say that because all the reviews and pictures looked so good. END
BEGIN NOW      And I was really excited to find a new place to have breakfast/brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      We got there on a Saturday around 11ish. END
BEGIN NOW      We were able to sit down right away, which was surprising. END
BEGIN NOW      But we definitely came at the right time because right after we sat down, a whole bunch of people started showing up. END
BEGIN NOW      A lot of the menu items looked really good. END
BEGIN NOW      But I am a huge fan of Eggs Florentine. END
BEGIN NOW      So that is what I ordered. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked to add ham and with my English muffin on the side. END
BEGIN NOW      And a cappuccino. END
BEGIN NOW      My boyfriend ordered the Italian omelet. END
BEGIN NOW      And a coffee. END
BEGIN NOW      When our food came out, it smelled great. END
BEGIN NOW      My boyfriends omelet looked good. END
BEGIN NOW      But he said later on that there was more meat than there was eggs in his omelet. END
BEGIN NOW      My plate was covered in vegetable juice, which made everything (including my potatoes and English muffin) soggy. END
BEGIN NOW      My eggs were cooked perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW      But I could not get over how wet my plate was. END
BEGIN NOW      The potatoes were okay. END
BEGIN NOW      They were cooked perfectly but they were a bit bland. END
BEGIN NOW      I really wanted to like this place. END
BEGIN NOW      But I was let down. END
BEGIN NOW      I wanna give it a second chance. END
BEGIN NOW      And I probably will. END
BEGIN NOW      But I won't be ordering the same thing again. END
BEGIN NOW      Definitely gonna try the pancakes and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW      It looked great when other people ordered it. END
BEGIN NOW     Great service! We sat be the window in a booth. END
BEGIN NOW       Very chill atmosphere for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the benedict here and it was quite tasty with the egg yolk nice and runny. END
BEGIN NOW      Good portions. END
BEGIN NOW     Really nice and quiet Cafe, with a patio! The patio is ONLY opened on the Weekends and Holidays. END
BEGIN NOW      Waiters are very timely and the food comes in less than 10mins, no joke! The pictures don't do justice: the food looks really good, but the flavor isn't there at all! My grilled chicken and avocado was flavorless as well as my potatoes! I do recommend trying this place out, but you're going to have to add some hot sauce onto your dish!. END
BEGIN NOW     Came here this morning for brunch and there was no wait! We had to sit on the upstairs outdoor patio area which wasn't too bad because today was warmer than it has been this week. END
BEGIN NOW      I hope I can come back sometime in the summer and sit outdoors again! We ordered the eggs benedict and the eggs lox. END
BEGIN NOW      As some of the other reviews mentioned, service is super quick! I would say within ten minutes of us ordering, or food was in front of us! My eggs lox was delicious but there was a little bit talk much hollandaise sauce so my potatoes were a bit on the soggy side. END
BEGIN NOW      Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and definitely want to come back and try the other menu items!. END
BEGIN NOW     Service is Awesome , come early . END
BEGIN NOW      Got a half an half of buttermilk pancakes and cinnamon French  toast. END
BEGIN NOW      With warm blueberry sauce . END
BEGIN NOW      Dip it in and savior the sweetest pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW       Full breakfast with all the fittings from lite fair to a full breakfast that can feed 2. END
BEGIN NOW       It's all fresh . END
BEGIN NOW     MUST GO TO! Great service, homemade food, and welcoming environment. END
BEGIN NOW      Really cute family owned business. END
BEGIN NOW      Specials run around $11. END
BEGIN NOW     Omg little hidden gem in Oakland! Good is yummy me service is FAST! Also the coffee is out of this world hahahaha. END
BEGIN NOW     Charming cafe with outdoor seating located along Grand Avenue. END
BEGIN NOW      I like coming here for their benedicts, and haven't really tried anything else. END
BEGIN NOW      Love how they make the toast crunchy, as most places usually has it soggy by the time it comes out. END
BEGIN NOW      Fast and attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW      Eggs Blackstone is amaaaazing!. END
BEGIN NOW     Ordered to go on a Friday morning, the cashier said it'd be ready in 5 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW      Okay, no problem, they weren't lying about that. END
BEGIN NOW      I get there, pay for the food, and take it home (1 exit away). END
BEGIN NOW      The food was on paper plates with foil on top, what the heck?!? At the very least, have some containers or carry-out boxes. END
BEGIN NOW      That's not the end of it. END
BEGIN NOW      The food was horrible, it was very bland. END
BEGIN NOW                We ordered the Eggs Escapade and Lu's breakfast: bacon looked like jerky, very dry. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs had no flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      The french toast was soggy. END
BEGIN NOW      The Eggs Escapade had no flavor at all: the tomatoes overpowered everything, so it was very sour. END
BEGIN NOW      I couldn't even get a taste of avocados and it had a bunch of avocados (that's a plus). END
BEGIN NOW      Casino breakfast buffets are even better. END
BEGIN NOW     The outside looks pretty old and doesn't look open. END
BEGIN NOW      but it is! I'm a huge breakfast/brunch person, and this place definitely hit the spot! There were a lot to choose from and the food was made really fast (but I went in a little after it was opened). END
BEGIN NOW      I seriously recommend the french toast for all the carb + sweet lovers out there. END
BEGIN NOW     First time going and not wowed but will give it another go. END
BEGIN NOW     Salmon Omelette - Meh they should add more flavors to it its just eggs and salmon and the salmon was cold. END
BEGIN NOW     French Toast - very goodEggs Benedict - meh no flavorTruth be told the French Toast saved them and will come back for more. END
BEGIN NOW     Great place for brunch! Docking one star because of the noise level. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're into jamming to clanking dishes in a small space since the kitchen isn't enclosed, then it might not bother you. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was average but still delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll add this to my list of yummy weekend spots. END
BEGIN NOW     Easy enough to walk in and get a table for two later in the weekday morning or afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW      I usually get the Eggs a la Justin and it never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW      The breakfast potatoes are good and are served with sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW      Food comes out fast and hot and prices are cheap for good portions. END
BEGIN NOW      Parking in the area sucks though so be prepared to trek that hill if you're like me and refuse to pay for parking. END
BEGIN NOW     Very nice little cafe near Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW      Service was fast and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I was there slightly after typical breakfast rush on a weekday so it was really chill there. END
BEGIN NOW     I had the open face omelette which has lots of veggies. END
BEGIN NOW      It was lightly spiced so I added a few pinches of salt and it was great. END
BEGIN NOW      They had several daily specials on the board. END
BEGIN NOW     The atmosphere was nice. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely return. END
BEGIN NOW     I came in the early afternoon about 1pm. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered an omelet and I was extremely disappointed my toast was stale. END
BEGIN NOW      My potatoes were stale and dry as well. END
BEGIN NOW      Usually it's really good but I guess it's only good when the food is fresh in the early morning . END
BEGIN NOW      Also the guy who took my card rushed me so that made it even worse. END
BEGIN NOW     Looking for brunch one morning with friends and stumbled upon this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I love a good diner style breakfast and this place did not disappoint! I tried the veggie omelet with added avocado and egg white and of course potatoes and it was all delicious! The wait staff was very attentive and our coffee cups were frequently refilled. END
BEGIN NOW      They have quite a menu and look forward to trying different things each time!. END
BEGIN NOW     I was wary to write a review of this place, mostly because I don't want to contend with a crowd every time I'm hankering for French toast. END
BEGIN NOW      That said, I went around 11 this morning and felt like I could take a deep breath in a city that's often crowded to the brim. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was prompt, the menu was refreshingly no-frills, and the food was absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Portions were generous. END
BEGIN NOW      I would recommend the blueberry sauce they offer as an alternative to maple syrup -- whole blueberries still inside, and less saccharine than its traditional counterpart. END
BEGIN NOW     Will totally be back, especially with family from out of town who love to grab breakfast out. END
BEGIN NOW     Love Love LOVE the outside patio in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      So beautiful!! Although FYI there have been two occasions that spiders have FALLEN on my friends' laps. END
BEGIN NOW      Not the restaurant's fault but just a precaution!! I come here quite often for the eggs benny and the last few times I've been disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW      Not sure if they changed their hollandaise recipe or what. END
BEGIN NOW      Bring it back please!!. END
BEGIN NOW     I didn't want the overly hipster brunch at Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt more in the mood for your standard eggs, bacon, etc. END
BEGIN NOW      This was a great choice and I was happy with my order whole wheat oatmeal pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon -yum!Service was great, they even let us take our coffee to go. END
BEGIN NOW      I like that it's a little family owned place. END
BEGIN NOW      Apparently there is also a patio upstairs, will definitely sit there next time I come back. END
BEGIN NOW     Cute little gem on Grand if you don't want to deal with long waits and hipster menu stuff. END
BEGIN NOW      Only thing is their to go coffee cups were styrofoam and that's not very good for the environment. END
BEGIN NOW     I love their breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW      they are really fast and have everything you could want for a traditional big American breakfast, including the diner feel, or the outdoor back patio (also a tiny bit divey) if that's what you are looking for. END
BEGIN NOW     A good neighborhood jem. END
BEGIN NOW     Came in during the week for an early breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW       Super easy metered parking right outside on a Tuesday AM. END
BEGIN NOW       Always wanted to try Lynn &amp; Lu's. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretty old place with a lot of character. END
BEGIN NOW       Kind of dumpy. END
BEGIN NOW       Pretty small place too. END
BEGIN NOW       Has the look of a place that's an institution in the town. END
BEGIN NOW       Two outdoor tables on the sidewalk. END
BEGIN NOW       Eggs, bacon and OJ were fine. END
BEGIN NOW       Didn't care for the oatmeal pancake. END
BEGIN NOW       Not sweet enough for a diner raised on sweet waffles. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything else on the menu looked great. END
BEGIN NOW       Specials on the board too. END
BEGIN NOW       Good service. END
BEGIN NOW       I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW     Small and quaint atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      The employees were happy and easy to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW      I arrived with less than half my group of 5 yet they were understanding and helpful. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the special, French Toast with blueberry sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      Yummy!Regarding the check, they allowed us to each pay individually with cash and 2 cards. END
BEGIN NOW      Very reasonable price for delicious meal. END
BEGIN NOW     The pancakes are so fluffy and delicious! The staff is always sweet and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      One of my favorite spots. END
BEGIN NOW     Nice place, Very friendly, prompt, attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW      Had egg white name, green pepper, cheese omelet and grilled potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      A little weak on the ham, but otherwise good. END
BEGIN NOW      A nice hole in the wall type place. END
BEGIN NOW      Worth checking out. END
BEGIN NOW     great little diner in oakland. END
BEGIN NOW       food has flavor. END
BEGIN NOW       I was most impressed how well cooked the potatoes were. END
BEGIN NOW       wow, cooked to perfection. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the open face egg escapade. END
BEGIN NOW       delicious. END
BEGIN NOW        ? is would I return?  yes of course. END
BEGIN NOW       great waitress to, great customer service and food came out in a timely fashion. END
BEGIN NOW     I gotta say. END
BEGIN NOW      The rating on this spot were wrong. END
BEGIN NOW      This cute little location is the perfect spot for a nice one to one brunch! The staff is super friendly, quick service, and great food for sure!We showed up around 10:30 and saw there was a group of people outside. END
BEGIN NOW      You go inside to sign up and they give you a number - which I love since there's no real confusion. END
BEGIN NOW      We waited about 5 minutes even though we were fifth on the list. END
BEGIN NOW      Sat down, got a really nice waitress and she took our orders quickly. END
BEGIN NOW     We ordered the Eggs A La Justin, the Italian Frittata, and got some apple bread. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs a la justin were decently good (4/5) but for how cheap in cost they were, it totally put it on the 5/5 list for me. END
BEGIN NOW      The Italian Frittata was also pretty good but the spotlight was on the apple bread!! Freshly cooked. END
BEGIN NOW      Made it super warm and soft. END
BEGIN NOW      So delicious! This is something everyone should get if they come down here. END
BEGIN NOW     I'll definitely keep this place in mind if I ever feel like returning to a spot I already know for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     Great service, even better food, and a warm, casual atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm certainly coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW     Chill atmosphere and really fast/friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      The food itself is nothing incredible, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess other people had a better experience than I did. END
BEGIN NOW      But i was completely ignored from the minute I walked in. END
BEGIN NOW      There were only 2 other tables, maybe I don't look rich enough or like I'm from Piedmont?? Well I work down the street and would have come here every day but definitely am never going back. END
BEGIN NOW      The waitress (short asian girl with long hair) served everyone around me and checked on everyone multiple times, I wasn't even greeted until 10 minutes after I sat down! She even rushed past me apologizing to serve an older lady who came in 5 minutes after me. END
BEGIN NOW      When my food finally came it was okay, but not anything special. END
BEGIN NOW      Burger was overdone and chewy. END
BEGIN NOW      Then waited another 10 minutes after getting the check to get change for a 20. END
BEGIN NOW      Never got change or even a glance, and all i had besides the 20 was exact change and I had to leave to be somewhere, so I'm sorry but she did not get a tip. END
BEGIN NOW      I always tip even with bad service and if I had had change I would have but I couldn't wait around any longer. END
BEGIN NOW      Never coming here again, can't believe I was pushed aside for older wealthier looking patrons. END
BEGIN NOW      I work for a shop that caters to people with money but we give our attention to everyone and do not judge based on looks. END
BEGIN NOW     This place was solidly. END
BEGIN NOW      Okay. END
BEGIN NOW      We were in a rush and didn't want to give the bougie restraunt our money after a 30 minute wait. END
BEGIN NOW      It was kind of cute, a little dated but kind of family run vibe. END
BEGIN NOW      The food was just kind of bland and uninspired. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the eggs escapade which boasts having a whole bunch of spices. END
BEGIN NOW      I found none. END
BEGIN NOW      The cheddar was mild. END
BEGIN NOW      The potatoes were alright, not amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      My toast came dry and I had to ask for butter. END
BEGIN NOW      That being said, the service was REALLY fast and the food was relatively inexpensive. END
BEGIN NOW      Until they charged me 3. END
BEGIN NOW     50 for a cup of drip coffee!! And 2. END
BEGIN NOW     50 for iced tea!. END
BEGIN NOW     I come to this brunch spot frequently and I'm always amazed by their quick and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      By quick, I really do mean that your food is ordered AND ready within 10 minutes! My fav dish is the Benedicts a La Justin with a side of bacon - u should order it if you love avocado and bacon as much as I do! oh and don't forget to request for an outdoor patio seating on a sunny day. END
BEGIN NOW      :)Lynn and Lu's. END
BEGIN NOW      I'll see you again soon!. END
BEGIN NOW     ::Food::Been here twice so far and both times food was pretty good! I especially love their egg Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW      ::The place::Their customer service was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW      During my second visit, they forgot our drink order yet still charged us (they did take it out at the end though, after we asked them). END
BEGIN NOW      The place itself looks really tiny from outside but they actually have more patio seats in the back, which I love. END
BEGIN NOW      However, there still seems to always have a long long wait. END
BEGIN NOW      and parking on Grand can be a pain. END
BEGIN NOW     SERVICE IS FAST . END
BEGIN NOW     friendly and the food is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     especially the pancakes with blueberry sauce. END
BEGIN NOW     I love going here for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't know how they can always get the food to the table so incredibly fast. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is delicious and the staff is extremely nice. END
BEGIN NOW     Worst breakfast I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW     Eggs Jacqueline was swimming in water. END
BEGIN NOW       Ummmm I didn't order spinach mushroom soup!  This was suppose to be poached eggs topped on spinach and mushroom with cheese. END
BEGIN NOW       Literally, swimming in water. END
BEGIN NOW     BF's dish: spinach mushroom omelette. END
BEGIN NOW     Eggwhites were not even cooked thoroughly. END
BEGIN NOW       Did they stick any random person in the kitchen to cook?  Very very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW       Let's not forget the toast that tasted like it was from yesterday's service. END
BEGIN NOW     Overall restaurant environment - DIRTY!!! So if restaurant is dirty, that must mean the staff is DIRTY. END
BEGIN NOW     gross!Would never eat here AGAIN!. END
BEGIN NOW     Eggs benedict was to die for!  This place also has an intimate dining area in the upstairs backyard which was so lovely to sit and bask in the sun while eating. END
BEGIN NOW     All in all the food was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      Friendly staff and great prices. END
BEGIN NOW      I can't wait to return :-D. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the lox Benedict and French toast. END
BEGIN NOW      I was pretty disappointed to find that my eggs were both pretty raw when I cut into it. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs were extremely runny (not the way a poached egg should be). END
BEGIN NOW       The potatoes were soggy as well :( The French toast wasn't fluffy but it was flat and dense tasting. END
BEGIN NOW        Most likely never coming back again. END
BEGIN NOW      I had better else where. END
BEGIN NOW     There's a reason why they call Oakland The Town. END
BEGIN NOW      the cutest parts of it have a small town feel to it that's just hard to find in SF. END
BEGIN NOW      This place is a great example of it - it's in a bustling part of the city but it's all mom and pop charm, from the minimal decor to the amazingly friendly and enthusiastic servers. END
BEGIN NOW      i was thrilled to see oatmeal pancakes on the menu, but alas - they're just not as fluffy and delicious as regular, unhealthy pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW      A good way to get my sweet breakfast fix in without feeling too guilty, though! And I loved the blueberry sauce that came on top. END
BEGIN NOW      Other than that, the best bet is to go with classic breakfast items here, like eggs and bacon and omelets. END
BEGIN NOW      Nothing crazy, nothing fancy. END
BEGIN NOW      just what I like when it comes to going out to breakfast! I'll definitely be back every time I visit friends in the area!. END
BEGIN NOW     Maybe I came the wrong day. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything was great but the ham in the Western omelette was horrible. END
BEGIN NOW       The potatoes, eggs, coffee, service were all excellent just like the  previous Yelp reviews. END
BEGIN NOW       But the ham was so thin and it tasted like it was of inferior quality. END
BEGIN NOW       If it had not been for the ham, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Affordable breakfast entrees and hearty portions - I enjoyed the food here and will come back eventually. END
BEGIN NOW       Service was mediocre but no real complaints. END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered the Spudorama with cheese and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict; usually breakfast establishments do not give generous portions but this cafe does not adhere to that trend. END
BEGIN NOW       Everything was good but there was something missing tastewise that would have made my entree undeniably delicious. END
BEGIN NOW     What a nice little place! We went today and were not really expecting to get a seat right away - Labor Day rush. END
BEGIN NOW      But all was good and we got a nice place outside on their patio. END
BEGIN NOW      The wait staff was a bit stressed, but that was no wonder because the house was full. END
BEGIN NOW      That said, service was fast and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was good and portions were big. END
BEGIN NOW      The bacon could have been a bit crispier, but that's really the only thing that was not 100% good. END
BEGIN NOW      We paid under $30 for two with two breakfasts, a side of bacon and two drinks. END
BEGIN NOW      All in all a nice experience and we will surely be back!. END
BEGIN NOW     I cannot see why there are not more five star reviews here. END
BEGIN NOW      From seating our group of six right away to quick service, to food so good we were all sharing off each other's plate to taste the awesome. END
BEGIN NOW     I shall return!. END
BEGIN NOW     I was craving for an Eggs Benedict and found this place on Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW      I decided to try this place out one morning. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was very fast. END
BEGIN NOW      We got our food in less than 10 minutes it seemed like. END
BEGIN NOW      The portions are huge, and my order was definitely delicious!After I put in my order I noticed the specials on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW      Such a shame. END
BEGIN NOW      The description of the specials looked really appetizing. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe next time! Otherwise, this is a cute restaurant just above Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW      Parking may be difficult during certain times in the day. END
BEGIN NOW     Came here on a Friday morning with a few friends. END
BEGIN NOW      We all had breakfast omelettes. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the California (added bacon) and the oatmeal pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW      Deliciousness!!! Service was excellent, doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a great little place to check out. END
BEGIN NOW     One of my co-workers came up to me one Monday morning and told me she wanted to show me something. END
BEGIN NOW      She is this cute older German woman and told me she took a picture of this place to show me because it was an excellent eat near where I live. END
BEGIN NOW      She was right. END
BEGIN NOW      I went for the first time this Saturday when my parents visited with the family dog. END
BEGIN NOW      We were happy that there was outside seating so little Heidy could join us. END
BEGIN NOW      Right away I could tell that this was a family run mom-and-pop sort of place that had an intimate and welcoming feel to it. END
BEGIN NOW      My parents both tried the Eggs Jacqueline. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a spin off of Eggs Benedict with fresh mushrooms, spinach, cheese, and their own homemade sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      Of course I took a bite and it was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      It is apparent that they have fresh produce and make everything from scratch. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the BLTAvo, which is a BLT with avocado. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked for mine on sourdough because it came with wheat and I didn't really feel like wheat at the moment. END
BEGIN NOW      It was great and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW      All of the dishes came along with grilled red potatoes which were flavored with rosemary and served with plain yogurt. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was prompt and attentive and the food came pretty quick. END
BEGIN NOW      I will definitely return and try something new. END
BEGIN NOW     Went here yesterday (Saturday) around brunch-time. END
BEGIN NOW      Wasn't too busy, which was nice, so my cousin and I were able to get seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW      But note that the place is kinda small, so your table might be pressed up against someone else's table - so hopefully that doesn't bother you. END
BEGIN NOW      The staff was friendly, but were not always available when needed. END
BEGIN NOW     The food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      Shared the Italian fritata omelette and one of the specials, a waffle with strawberrys, bananas, and blueberry syrup. END
BEGIN NOW      While the food was good, I didn't think it was anything particularly unique. END
BEGIN NOW      The waffles were very similar to what you'd get at other diners - not better or worse. END
BEGIN NOW      The Italian fritata with sausage was fairly good, particularly the use of salsa, but despite that, it seemed to lack flavour. END
BEGIN NOW     This cafe looks like a great place to have late breakfast, but after looking over the menu, I decided to get a burger instead. END
BEGIN NOW      No regrets whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW      That burger was juicy, the bacon crispy. END
BEGIN NOW      Thumbs up. END
BEGIN NOW     I don't really know how this place got as many good reviews as it has. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe I visited on an off day, because the service was really bad. END
BEGIN NOW     We arrived and were given a number? That's right, a number. END
BEGIN NOW      This might not seem weird at first blush, but in a restaurant setting where a bunch of people are standing around waiting to be seated, this causes a lot of issues. END
BEGIN NOW      This is probably why every other place takes people's names? The host would come out and call numbers out of order making many people think they had been skipped. END
BEGIN NOW      They were of course filling tables based on the number of people in the party and so they had to skip numbers and come back to them. END
BEGIN NOW      I never realized how good a system this is at the butcher's but how bad a system it turns out to be in a cafe setting. END
BEGIN NOW      The host seated us at a table out front of the cafe. END
BEGIN NOW      So, we got to listen to people frequently ask, "Did you skip x number?!" So, I wasn't the only one scratching my head. END
BEGIN NOW      Beyond that, when the meal was finished, they took my credit card and I had to request they run it and give it back to me. END
BEGIN NOW      The food was decent and came out quickly, but I think the poor service eclipsed anything the kitchen could have pulled off. END
BEGIN NOW      I guess it is busy because it is only one dollar sign on yelp?I think the wait staff were not regulars? I saw one of them collide with a door she was trying to push rather than pull. END
BEGIN NOW     It is rather ironic that I had the opposite of this same issue at La Farine on Fruitvale the other day. END
BEGIN NOW      At that La Farine location I think they are in desperate need of a number taking system. END
BEGIN NOW      Odd how that one decision plays out in my ratings. END
BEGIN NOW     I ate here for the first (and only) time recently. END
BEGIN NOW      Clearly, it's a beloved spot in the neighborhood--the place was steadily packed for Sunday breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW      While waiting to be seated, my friend and I stood at the bottom of the staircase at the rear of the restaurant, rather than hover over seated diners in front. END
BEGIN NOW      And then I saw it: the tub of hollandaise mix on a storage shelf. END
BEGIN NOW      Any expectations I had of a great meal vanished on the spot. END
BEGIN NOW      Even though I knew they don't make their hollandaise from scratch, I went ahead and ordered the eggs benedict. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs were poached nicely, and the potatoes were pretty good, but on the whole it was, as expected, unexceptional. END
BEGIN NOW      And why wouldn't it be, with a flavorless, un-lemoned hollandaise sauce? My friend seemed happy with her meal, but the side salad it came with looked like your basic lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      It would have been nice to see some quality mixed greens on the plate. END
BEGIN NOW      Nevertheless, the servers are friendly and eager to please. END
BEGIN NOW      They kept my friend's coffee cup and my water cup full. END
BEGIN NOW      Also, I used the bathroom after the owner vacated it, and I could tell he had just washed his hands at the sink, so at least that practice is observed. END
BEGIN NOW      Three stars, just barely. END
BEGIN NOW     The waiter was really sweet and the cook was nice too. END
BEGIN NOW      The French Toast is very average. END
BEGIN NOW      Plain jane wheat slices, dipped , not soaked at all, in half scrambled egg and and cooked on griddle that was too hot. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't think was cinnamon like the menu said. END
BEGIN NOW       There were 8 pieces to make up for it though. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend had 3/4 cup of potatoes and an egg and a sausage for $11 before tax and tip. END
BEGIN NOW      Hmm. END
BEGIN NOW      The potatoes  were crisp and yummy. END
BEGIN NOW      It was empty that day because construction was going on street side. END
BEGIN NOW      I wouldn't go back unless it was really last minute or really convenient. END
BEGIN NOW      Three stars for average. END
BEGIN NOW      Really nice people though. END
BEGIN NOW     I came here the 2nd time because I remember my first time here was pretty gosh darn good. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a simple brunch place. END
BEGIN NOW     This cute little mom and pops kind of diner serves yummy food at reasonable price. END
BEGIN NOW       The service has always been great and I've only sat at the booth right at the window. END
BEGIN NOW     Here's what I've ordered:Cinnamon Rasin French ToastThis came with bacon and eggs!  Both were decent and I had asked for a side of blueberry sauce that is housemade. END
BEGIN NOW       It was delicious!  The french toast i thought was generic but not bad. END
BEGIN NOW     Eggs A La Justin BenedictThis is pretty much eggs benedict but with avocado!  This was absolutely delicious!!!  It came with a side of potatoes was yummy. END
BEGIN NOW     I'd defintely come back here. END
BEGIN NOW       I really enjoy a breakfast mom and pops kinda place :D. END
BEGIN NOW     My very dearest Oakland friend had taken me to Lynn and Lu's Cafe a few weeks ago and today I had the opportunity to bring some guests there. END
BEGIN NOW     We had previously eaten in their small but sunny pleasant outside cafe and we enjoyed pancakes and sausage. END
BEGIN NOW       The coffee is superb!Today it was chilly and foggy but we were seated right away and the staff, as always, were very attentive to feed us coffee and juice right away. END
BEGIN NOW     Today we ordered the Country Italian frittata and a daily special which included potatoes, pesto, sausage and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      Lynn and Lu's is definitely a great place for breakfast and thankfully walkable from any place around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW       The people have managed a great place and they really know how to make you welcome. END
BEGIN NOW     Okay, when you're working with customer service, you do not rudely say "what?" every single time you don't hear what a customer says. END
BEGIN NOW      Talk about manners! Not to mention he didn't hear my sister order a piece of toast, instead of asking her twice, he went to his coworker and asked her to take care of us instead. END
BEGIN NOW      Uhhhh these kids are lucky my mom left a tip! The waiter seemed unexperienced. END
BEGIN NOW      He was very rude about taking our order as if it was a burden that we were there. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're putting someone unexperienced on the floor, at least give them a proper training. END
BEGIN NOW      I've been coming here for years and this is the second unpleasant experience I've had due to customer service. END
BEGIN NOW      If I'm paying $9 for a plate of food I expect decent service. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered an eggs blackstone and a fresh orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW      The "fresh orange juice" was clearly not "fresh". END
BEGIN NOW      It tasted like Tropicana and looked like Tropicana. END
BEGIN NOW      I wouldn't order it if I knew it wasn't fresh squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs blackstone was OK. END
BEGIN NOW      My poached eggs were perfectly cooked but the hollandaise hardly had flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      The biscuit was waaaay too buttery for my liking and I never thought I'd say it, but there was way too much bacon - it was overpowering. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, the dish was good, but it could've been more balanced out with flavors. END
BEGIN NOW      I understand it's a mom and pops restaurant but the people here need to learn something about customer service before they lose more customers - especially the local regulars. END
BEGIN NOW      At least smile upon greeting us! Gees louis! Three stars for the decent benedict and overall appearance/environment of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      But terrible service, I hope they improve. END
BEGIN NOW     Wow. END
BEGIN NOW      Yelps popularity has a down side, almost 500 people can be wrong. END
BEGIN NOW      First off, drinks. END
BEGIN NOW       The water. END
BEGIN NOW      It tastes like burning, what ever window fluid that is shouldn't be consumed. END
BEGIN NOW        I ordered a soda, which wasn't bad except I hate ordering a soft drink and there is no indication its a can until it arrives. END
BEGIN NOW       Just note it on the menu so I can make an informed decision. END
BEGIN NOW      FOOD -  yikes. END
BEGIN NOW      My wife ordered the eggs benny with spinach and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW      Forget what they label it. END
BEGIN NOW      IT CAME IN A SOUP BOWL! There was so much liquid in the bottom it needed the bowl. END
BEGIN NOW      I AM NOT referring to hollandaise sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      There was some strange soupy liquid in the bowl? The mushrooms were terrible and the entire dish was utterly tasteless. END
BEGIN NOW      The poached eggs were done well. END
BEGIN NOW      Should also be noted the potatoes looked good. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the "Lynn", to be fair it doesn't say Belgian waffle, and it isnt. END
BEGIN NOW      Leggo my eggo is more like it. END
BEGIN NOW      My over medium eggs were done well and Bacon was not terrible. END
BEGIN NOW       Service-  weren't too busy so service was prompt. END
BEGIN NOW      The young lady that took our order seemed very nice. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall. END
BEGIN NOW      I stick with the 1 star just a completely different story than the yelp average will lead to believe. END
BEGIN NOW      Eat with caution; its not 4 star in my world and isn't even close. END
BEGIN NOW     One of my friends and business partner turned me on to this place. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm not sure I would have noticed it on my own. END
BEGIN NOW      I love the unique vibe, very chill. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is amazing! If you love breakfast foods this is your spot! Those potatoes with everything on them, pesto, tomatoes and all sorts of goodness! My mouth is watering now as I recall all the yummy flavors. END
BEGIN NOW     So, it's been a while since I've been here and don't remember it being this good before? I'm pretty picky about restaurants becasue I was a waiter, bartender and know when the service is bad or the people are having a bad day. END
BEGIN NOW      Neither happened today. END
BEGIN NOW      We sat on the the patio out back, the staff was super nice, our food came our fast and It was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      This is going to be my new breakfast spot. END
BEGIN NOW      You should def. END
BEGIN NOW      Check it out. END
BEGIN NOW      :)Jes. END
BEGIN NOW     Ok. END
BEGIN NOW     STAY AWAY!Talk about service. END
BEGIN NOW      This place is the WORST. END
BEGIN NOW      The waitresses have an attitude and one of them is still drunk! In a 20 minute period, they lost 8 customers including us. END
BEGIN NOW     So they lost 8 plus 6 of us and they did not care!We even tried to explain to the manger and the snotty bastards blew us off. END
BEGIN NOW      Dont care how good the food is. END
BEGIN NOW     if your service sucks. END
BEGIN NOW     STAY AWAY!. END
BEGIN NOW     It's rare that I give 5 stars to anything, and I never give 5 stars to casual dining restaurants, but this one has broken the mold. END
BEGIN NOW     For value, taste and speed of service this place is incredible. END
BEGIN NOW      I was speedily seated and my order of Eggs Justin arrived in less than 5 minutes: hot, fresh and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       The Eggs Justin are two perfectly brown and crispy halves of an English muffin, topped with tomato, two thick, perfectly ripe halves of avocado, poached eggs and a delicious hollandaise. END
BEGIN NOW       I have never had any version of eggs Benedict in which the English muffin was so perfectly crisped and brown. END
BEGIN NOW       The poached eggs were PERFECTLY cooked, the beautiful yellow yolks breaking open to lap redolently over the creamy avocado goodness and buttery  crispness of the muffin. END
BEGIN NOW       I defy any vegetarian to not fall immediately in love with this egg dish. END
BEGIN NOW       The breakfast potatoes-- so often a  throw away in even the best restaurants-- were amazingly seasoned; I think I detected basil, rosemary and oregano. END
BEGIN NOW       I did add some salt to my plate, but every one has a different palate when it comes to eggs: the salt just brought out the simple and delicious flavors. END
BEGIN NOW       The coffee was actually pretty decent, too. END
BEGIN NOW     The wife and I popped in on a Saturday morning, looking for a good ol' brunch place and we were intrigued by all the good reviews. END
BEGIN NOW       We came around 11 and told it would be about a 25 minute wait. END
BEGIN NOW       The place has a homey feel (but a little chaotic with people running around everywhere- not the quietest place) and a nice patio in the back that has additional seating. END
BEGIN NOW     I ordered the Willy's omelette (chicken apple sausage, provolone cheese, green onions) and the wife got the eggs benedict with smoked salmon. END
BEGIN NOW       My omelette was pretty tasty and a good value for the price. END
BEGIN NOW       It also came with potatoes which were so-so and a couple slices of toast. END
BEGIN NOW       We were a little disappointed with the eggs benedict. END
BEGIN NOW       The hollandaise sauce was a little runny but overall, it wasn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW     The service was friendly and pretty attentive and the prices were good for the amount of food we got. END
BEGIN NOW       I've definitely had better breakfasts but this place wasn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW     The fastest service, amazing brunch food and specials! The best omelette and homemade salsa in town!. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is one of those classic "hurry up and buy" Chinese Restaurants Fast in,and fast out. END
BEGIN NOW      I don't mind that type of service when it comes to my local Chinese joint, but not for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW     You're quickly seated and the food does come out pretty fast, but it lacks quality and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're in a hurry and fine with food that's just average, then this is the place for you. END
BEGIN NOW     I gave this place two stars; one for being fast, and the other for being edible. END
BEGIN NOW     Prompt and friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW      Delicious food and ample portions. END
BEGIN NOW     Everything I look for in a great little breakfast or lunch joint. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the California omelette. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW      Mmmm. END
BEGIN NOW     Solid, I've meant to go to Lynn and Lu's a few times but it's small. END
BEGIN NOW       This particular weekend they had space inside!  Sweet, I and two former co-workers met up for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW     We were seated promptly, get some water and shortly later the waiter came back for an order. END
BEGIN NOW       We needed a few minutes, and they came back a few minutes later again and we placed our orders. END
BEGIN NOW       Everyone got something with eggs, I got a veggie omlette with fruit on the side. END
BEGIN NOW       The food is a decent value, the staff is prompt, and the food tastes good. END
BEGIN NOW       Also, it's in Oakland a nice central location. END
BEGIN NOW       What isn't to like?I suppose you could find fault with the older interior or that it gets really busy in here. END
BEGIN NOW       Still, considering what is is I'd come back. END
BEGIN NOW     This unassuming joint on the west side of Grand Ave just above the lake rocks the house and takes down the competition! I actually felt bad for the empty bakery breakfast option right next door. END
BEGIN NOW     Everybody definitely got this place right---indeedy, cheap and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW      Props to my fellow kinsman who can run such a great place. END
BEGIN NOW     greasy spoon without the heaviness of cheap ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW      $8 for a humongous breakfast that incl. END
BEGIN NOW      3 egg omelette, toast, and grilled red potatoes--opted for Willi's cuz I'm a sucka for chick app sausage (many, many great breakfast options). END
BEGIN NOW     I came today for a late-ish breakfast amidst a day of appts and errands, and was so satisfied with them. END
BEGIN NOW      Didn't need to eat again for at least 7 hours. END
BEGIN NOW      Turnaround time was great, and no need to wait! Love finding this cafe. END
BEGIN NOW     diamond in the roughPS never availed myself of the back patio (for the slower pace) but I was on mission to complete the to-do list for the day (type A that I am); patios are great for al fresco and just automatically relaxes one to 'feel' the outside!. END
BEGIN NOW     Came here for Breakfast on a Sunday morning around 9:30ish with four others. END
BEGIN NOW      We were seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW     Atmosphere: Cute and tiny. END
BEGIN NOW      It's nothing really fancy, but I've heard it can get a little crowded around brunch time. END
BEGIN NOW     Food: I was conflicted between sweet and savory. END
BEGIN NOW      Luckily, my friend agreed that he would get the Eggs A La Justin and I would get the Pancakes with Blueberry Sauce and we would share. END
BEGIN NOW      Probably the best idea since in the words of Hannah Montana, "you get the best of both worlds" (yeah, I just went there). END
BEGIN NOW     If you are a fan of avocados, the Eggs A La Justin will be your calling. END
BEGIN NOW      The use a FULL avocado with this eggs benedict. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, it was pretty damn delicious, but it is kind of heavy - I would not have been able to finish one order on my own. END
BEGIN NOW      The pancakes were some of the best I've ever had - super fluffy and light. END
BEGIN NOW      And the blueberry sauce was a nice sweet touch. END
BEGIN NOW      So good man, so good. END
BEGIN NOW      Everything is reasonably priced especially considering the delicious quality and quantity of their food. END
BEGIN NOW     Service: Quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     I wish I knew of this place while I was living in Berkeley. END
BEGIN NOW     Love this local spot!Round 1:It was during the weekend for brunch and boy was it packed! Lucky us, we got a table on the patio out back. END
BEGIN NOW      A nice breeze, sunshine, and FAST SERVICE!The food is delicious too. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the eggs lox and Jason E. END
BEGIN NOW      had the spinach and mushroom omelette. END
BEGIN NOW      Both are hefty portions with those home fried potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      DELICIOUS!The staff is really friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW      They check up on you just enough. END
BEGIN NOW     Round 2: Friday morning bright and early. END
BEGIN NOW      We ate inside this time. END
BEGIN NOW      It was quiet and mellow. END
BEGIN NOW      The patio was not open, but no worries. END
BEGIN NOW     Jason got the eggs lox this time and I had Lu's breakfast, the French toast. END
BEGIN NOW      The raisin bread was good, but the execution of cooking the French toast was not so good. END
BEGIN NOW      I really don't like it when the egg in the batter just looks like egg cooked onto the bread. END
BEGIN NOW      It doesn't taste so nice. END
BEGIN NOW      The bacon is super yummy (yes put syrup on it)! I wonder what should I order next time?Thanks Lynn &amp; Lu!Until next time, happy brunching!. END
BEGIN NOW     Read as 3. END
BEGIN NOW     51. END
BEGIN NOW       Diane and I met here for brunch this morning. END
BEGIN NOW       It's a sweet old school place w/ bench seats at tables in the windows on either side of the front door and tables and chairs on both sides of the room. END
BEGIN NOW       There's a sign on the screen door stating that parties would not be seated until everyone was there, but the restaurant was mostly empty at 10:30 on a Friday morning and they invited me to take a seat. END
BEGIN NOW       Diane joined me a few minutes later. END
BEGIN NOW       We looked at the menus and there was a lot that was interesting. END
BEGIN NOW       Diane ordered the Benedict w/ avocado. END
BEGIN NOW       I forget what it was called but it was gorgeous, w/ what looked like a whole avocado divided between the two English muffins. END
BEGIN NOW       She requested the hollandaise on the side and didn't use it. END
BEGIN NOW       She likes her eggs poached medium/hard and these were a little underdone for her taste, though they would have been a bit hard for mine. END
BEGIN NOW       She had coffee and said it was good. END
BEGIN NOW       I had tea, Twinings, which was served w/ a small pot of water in addition to the water in the cup. END
BEGIN NOW       I ordered Lynn's Breakfast, which was a waffle w/ two eggs any style and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW       I was offered the choice of maple or blueberry syrup and opted for the former. END
BEGIN NOW       Each component of my breakfast was good. END
BEGIN NOW       The waffle was tasty, the eggs, which I had scrambled, were fresh and good and there were 4 pieces of bacon cooked nicely. END
BEGIN NOW       It was basic, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW       Diane wasn't interested in returning, but I think I'll introduce Alan to it one of these days and see what he thinks. END
BEGIN NOW       Prices were very reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW     They've really upped their game recently. END
BEGIN NOW      It's cool to see a good restaurant get better. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the Lu's Breakfast (cinnamon french toast,  blueberry sauce, two eggs, four strips of perfectly crispy bacon) and was much impressed. END
BEGIN NOW       Just the right amount of yumminess without being greasy like in the past. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is very attentive, my coffee never went empty. END
BEGIN NOW      They must be brewing better coffee too, because this was not diner coffee, it was good stuff. END
BEGIN NOW      The addition of the back patio seating area keeps it from feeling overcrowded now too. END
BEGIN NOW       Nothing more i could ask of this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Five stars! I'll be back more frequently now. END
BEGIN NOW     We also came here due to the high reviews. END
BEGIN NOW       Food is just so-so. END
BEGIN NOW       Some dishes were great, others were awful. END
BEGIN NOW       I feel bad for giving them just 3 stars because the service was good and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW       They're also a locally owned business. END
BEGIN NOW     Wait time was about 15 minutes on a Saturday morning. END
BEGIN NOW       It was chilly, so we waited in the back of the cafe. END
BEGIN NOW     Here's the rundown on the meal:Coffee: very weak and smoky flavored. END
BEGIN NOW       Seriously, they could easily do better. END
BEGIN NOW       If they hired more help &amp; got an espresso machine, it would more than pay for itself. END
BEGIN NOW       Hint, hint!  I did appreciate that they gave me a small pitcher of soy milk. END
BEGIN NOW       Awesome!Orange Juice: sweet and freshly squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW       Great job!Eggs Benedict: nicely cooked and topped with a delicious Hollandaise sauce. END
BEGIN NOW       Potatoes were tender, a tad undersalted, but easily corrected with ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW       They were cut into large chunks, not crispy on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW     Oatmeal Pancakes: Unless you're a health food nut, stay away from these. END
BEGIN NOW       And I LOVE oatmeal of all sorts. END
BEGIN NOW       Like another reviewer mentioned, the texture is quite off putting. END
BEGIN NOW       It's like eating the end of a whole wheat loaf of bread, but a bit thicker. END
BEGIN NOW       Not quite as tough, but dense and slightly dry. END
BEGIN NOW       There is a prominent "wheaty" flavor. END
BEGIN NOW       Comes with a warm, watered down blueberry sauce. END
BEGIN NOW       I like whole wheat bread, but I had a difficult time eating this. END
BEGIN NOW     Side of bacon &amp; eggs: My scrambled eggs were perfect. END
BEGIN NOW       The bacon (regular American style) was crispy, hot, and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW       Bacon was one of the things they did exceptionally well. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices are reasonable, not super cheap, but worth it if you're too lazy to cook breakfast at home. END
BEGIN NOW       Not fancy food, just fresh regular food. END
BEGIN NOW       The place is packed and loud. END
BEGIN NOW       There is cool local art on the walls. END
BEGIN NOW       A neat experience overall. END
BEGIN NOW       Know that it's not gourmet food, order carefully (get the bacon!), and you won't be disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW     This place wasn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW      We would definitely go back, but I wouldn't do the Benedict again. END
BEGIN NOW      The hollandaise was a too runny and not enough. END
BEGIN NOW      We did get one pancake though to split and not having had a pancake in years. END
BEGIN NOW      It was awesome! We will be coming back to try out some new items!. END
BEGIN NOW     Great little hole in the wall! Had the runners breakfast and my boyfriend had Wayne's breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW      Both came out fast and were delicious!  Coffee was pretty good as well. END
BEGIN NOW      We will definitely make this a regular spot for breakfast!. END
BEGIN NOW     An escapade it is! From undercooked eggs with deli meat and raw peppers omlettes to flavorless potatoes, this meal was meh with a side of sad. END
BEGIN NOW      The cappuccino was unadventurous as well, however we experienced quite the escapade with someone else's drink as we watched the waitress take a sip as she carried it to prevent it from spilling. END
BEGIN NOW      Ew. END
BEGIN NOW      But I guess that's the name of the game when you come to Lyn and Lu's Escapade Cafe!. END
BEGIN NOW     One of my favorite spots for brunch! Egg lox's is my fav. END
BEGIN NOW      I do wish they served grits tho. END
BEGIN NOW      Small mom and pop feel. END
BEGIN NOW      Prices are cheap and the food comes out fast, they have 2 bench like tables near the window that I like to sit at facing grand. END
BEGIN NOW      Owner is a very nice man, who takes pride in satisfying his customers. END
BEGIN NOW     Super speedy service- if you are hungry come on overi love this place! after moving to oakland this was one of my happy discoveries. END
BEGIN NOW      the place is reasonably priced, the service is top notch- quick and efficient, and the location is just above lake merritt where there are plenty of little boutique shops you can check out before or after. END
BEGIN NOW     i recommend trying their specials. END
BEGIN NOW      there are of course the brunch staples but i like coming in and checking out what's new. END
BEGIN NOW      if nothing new strikes your fancy then have a classic eggs benedict. END
BEGIN NOW      :)until next timecheers!. END
BEGIN NOW     Love the patio upstair I came here last saturday!! Lovely breakfast I got the eggs lox and my friend got a eggs florentine!!! Dont forget to check out specials on the board! Will come back and try the huevo ranchero and whole wheat blueberry pancakes!! Service was okay I feel sorry for those servers they walking up and down the stairs like crazy!!! Nice little place def. END
BEGIN NOW     go check it out guys!!. END
BEGIN NOW     The staff was great!  Friendly courteous people. END
BEGIN NOW       Several people came by to make sure water and coffee cups were always refilled. END
BEGIN NOW       Smiles around. END
BEGIN NOW      The menu had promise but the food was ok. END
BEGIN NOW       The ingredients didn't quite go well together to create something flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW       For example, the omelette had cheese, bell peppers, and mushrooms, which sounded like it would be good, and the portion was big, but it was a watery mess. END
BEGIN NOW       There were way too many green peppers in that dish. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the eggs florentine, and that was a watery mess too. END
BEGIN NOW       The spinach and poached eggs were sitting on top of the water it was cooked in or leached out or whatever, but it was not appealing. END
BEGIN NOW       Still, I'd come back if I want basic no fuss breakfasts. END
BEGIN NOW     Nothing any different from a typical, ordinary breakfast-serving restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW      No problem with being seated, the service, or the food. END
BEGIN NOW      Someone below wrote, "Good, but not super amazing. END
BEGIN NOW     " I concur, but will put it, "Not super amazing, but good. END
BEGIN NOW     " :). END
BEGIN NOW     Three of us went there based on yelp's 4 star review. END
BEGIN NOW      We ordered vegetarian omlette and 2 French toast, beacon n eggs n potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      All of us were disappointed with the food. END
BEGIN NOW      They were bland and tasteless. END
BEGIN NOW      Two of us ended up going to another restaurant to eat again. END
BEGIN NOW     Do you like quickies &amp; instant gratification?If you answer "yes". END
BEGIN NOW      then come to Lynn &amp; Lu's because service here is fastforwarded:- there was no wait to be seated- coffee delivered within a minute of ordering- food arrived within 5 minutes- the check arrived a few minutes after the food arrivedSeriously, I highly dislike waiting and saved time &amp; money eating here than at other 4 star brunch places in SF. END
BEGIN NOW      As for the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Eggs benedict a la justine: 3. END
BEGIN NOW     75 stars: simple &amp; clean tasting with perfectly poached eggs, a chunk of fresh avocado &amp; slice of tomato all on toasted English Muffin. END
BEGIN NOW      Pancakes w/ homemade blueberry sauce: 3 stars: sweet &amp; with real blueberries in the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW      The pancake was probably something you could make on your own, but the sauce was good and for the price (just under $5 or $6)- it was a steal. END
BEGIN NOW     My boyfriend loves this place. END
BEGIN NOW      Seriously--loves. END
BEGIN NOW      Possibly loves this place more than me. END
BEGIN NOW      He'll probably have a heart attack when he sees that I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5. END
BEGIN NOW      But when it comes to breakfast food, I'm rarely blown out of my mind. END
BEGIN NOW      Perhaps upon trying more dishes they will earn their last star--they've got potential, that's all I can say. END
BEGIN NOW     But the more important point--ASIAN PEOPLE CAN MAKE BREAKFAST? WTF, MATE? Oh yes. END
BEGIN NOW      Yes they can. END
BEGIN NOW      Didn't know that until I went here. END
BEGIN NOW      And from what it looks like, seems like they can bring in a non-Asian clientele. END
BEGIN NOW      That's pretty impressive to me. END
BEGIN NOW     So far we've ordered: a meat omelet (can't remember which), eggs benedict, potato escapade, and another special that had bacon, eggs, hollandaise, and tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      By far the best is the potatoes escapade. END
BEGIN NOW      who would have thunk that PESTO can go into breakfast? Seriously. END
BEGIN NOW      Cheese + pesto on just about anything will make me go nuts. END
BEGIN NOW      Their specials menu alone is worth coming back for. END
BEGIN NOW      And coming back, yes I will. END
BEGIN NOW      as long as I can keep the bf when we're done eating. END
BEGIN NOW     I really enjoyed this mom and pop breakfast dig. END
BEGIN NOW     Waffle looked like an Eggo but tasted bomb!  Thought I'd get 3 strips of bacon but got about a dozen. END
BEGIN NOW       Legit. END
BEGIN NOW     Service and food were stellar when a couple friends and I had breakfast here. END
BEGIN NOW      I can't think of another way I would prefer spending a warm and sunny morning than from the back patio of Lynn &amp; Lu's enjoying some hot coffee and perfectly poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW     Pretty standard eggs &amp; bacon spot. END
BEGIN NOW       Little pricey. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the BLT on a bagel, which was pretty damn good. END
BEGIN NOW     My fav is Lu's special. END
BEGIN NOW      The French Toast is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      Bacon Bacon Bacon!!! When i'm feelings sinful on a saturday or Sunday you'll know because i'll be outside relaxing. END
BEGIN NOW     I have had this place bookmarked forever. END
BEGIN NOW      The hub and I set out this morning for brunch and finally came here for our first time. END
BEGIN NOW     Time: Saturday at 10AM. END
BEGIN NOW     Location: Off Grand, easy to find and parking can be difficult especially on the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW     Place: It looked small and dark when I first walked in. END
BEGIN NOW      It was very busy inside. END
BEGIN NOW      We were asked if we wanted to sit out on the patio which we decided to do since it was a nice day. END
BEGIN NOW      Lots of seating on the patio in the back. END
BEGIN NOW      I would opt for the patio seating since the dining room looked jam packed with people. END
BEGIN NOW     Menu/Food: Lots to choose from they have their regular weekly breakfast options and their weekend brunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the Willi omelet which was 3 eggs with chicken apple sausage, green onion and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      I asked for egg whites. END
BEGIN NOW      Their breakfast/brunch plates all come with grilled red potatoes and your choice of toast. END
BEGIN NOW      I subbed my toast for the apple coffee cake which was $1. END
BEGIN NOW     00 extra, well worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      The Hub ordered the frittata which is their open face omelet that takes up the whole plate with tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese and green bell peppers. END
BEGIN NOW       The food was good, the portions were large, the ingredients were fresh and the only waited 10 minutes we were very surprised how fast it came out. END
BEGIN NOW      We both agreed that the potatoes were a little on the bland side it could use a little more spice. END
BEGIN NOW      We used some hot sauce and ketchup to help give them some flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Price: Most of the menu is around $8. END
BEGIN NOW     00-$10. END
BEGIN NOW     00. END
BEGIN NOW      Our tab was $18. END
BEGIN NOW     05 with two meals, extra charge for egg whites and coffee cake. END
BEGIN NOW      Not bad at all and worth coming back to. END
BEGIN NOW     Service: The waitresses were great very attentive with refilling our waters and asking if we needed anything through out the meal. END
BEGIN NOW      We didn't feel rushed and they wait until you are finished before putting down the check. END
BEGIN NOW      I hate receiving the check with the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Lynn and Lu's Cafe is a really small cafe hidden near lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW      This is what you call a hole in the wall. END
BEGIN NOW      Once you walk in, there is a little tiny eating area with maybe 10 tables. END
BEGIN NOW      However, they have a "patio" area located in the back of their store that you can sit at with maybe 15-20 more tables. END
BEGIN NOW      The chairs and table outside are really ghetto rigged. END
BEGIN NOW      The table top are two pieces of wood put together, so when you push down a little, 1/2 the table rises up. END
BEGIN NOW      The chairs are the white plastic ones which really clean or anything. END
BEGIN NOW      The service here is one of the best i have EVER had. END
BEGIN NOW      They are SO fast and prompt. END
BEGIN NOW      They are always ready to get anything you need. END
BEGIN NOW      The food comes out almost instantaneously, but not fast to the point where its like fast food. END
BEGIN NOW      In the patio they have their own mini kitchen in the back with drinks and utensils which makes it easier for them when you need something, versus them having to run back inside to get it. END
BEGIN NOW      My dish that i ordered was honestly REALLY good. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the Eggs Benedict with a side order of pancakes which i shared. END
BEGIN NOW      Both were VERY good. END
BEGIN NOW      The pancakes had a crunchy layer on the outside which made it taste even better. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs Benedict was absolutely exquisite. END
BEGIN NOW      The flavor, the sauce, the English muffin, everything was just so fresh and tasted so great. END
BEGIN NOW      Other orders on the table apparently wasn't so great. END
BEGIN NOW      I tried some of my cousins dishes, and they didn't taste as great as the Egg Benedict, which was by the way only 8. END
BEGIN NOW     95! (rough estimate, i forgot). END
BEGIN NOW      They don't have hashbrowns here, however they have their house potatoes, which were pretty good, but could have used some improvements. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt like they could have had a more crunchy outside moist inside. END
BEGIN NOW      The potatoes were almost like mashed potatoes, very mushy. END
BEGIN NOW      The price here is really cheap. END
BEGIN NOW      Almost all the dishes were under 9 or 10 bucks. END
BEGIN NOW      No where have i been has Eggs Benedict for under 9 bucks. END
BEGIN NOW      Appearance 2. END
BEGIN NOW     0Service 5. END
BEGIN NOW     0Food 4. END
BEGIN NOW     0Price 4. END
BEGIN NOW     0(Out of 5). END
BEGIN NOW     Good but not super amazing. END
BEGIN NOW      It's a very quaint place, food comes out right away. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the spuds orama with Italian sausage and that was good. END
BEGIN NOW      Sister had Lynn's breakfast and it was ok. END
BEGIN NOW      If you're a foodie, you won't really be impressed but if you're looking for just a cute and quaint brunch place - this is it. END
BEGIN NOW     I like this place. END
BEGIN NOW       It's good, it's cheap, it's quick, service is prompt and nice. END
BEGIN NOW       Nothing too complicated or over the top. END
BEGIN NOW       The 3-egg omelet with Avocado and cheese is my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW       Perhaps because I get here before 10 AM, there's never a wait for a table, another reason I like Lynn &amp; LuLu's. END
BEGIN NOW      (That's what I call it!) $21. END
BEGIN NOW     00 without tip for 2 people with coffee. END
BEGIN NOW       The eggs are probably not organic! It's kind of a greasy spoon, except the food isn't too greasy and they don't do things like pre-butter your bread. END
BEGIN NOW      You can be somewhat healthy here if you must. END
BEGIN NOW      The coffee isn't that strong, but there's lots of it, poured for you by a sweet young hardworking Asian girl. END
BEGIN NOW       I find the disparaging remarks about this being a Chinese owned business offensive and possibly incorrect. END
BEGIN NOW       Not sure, don't care, just get me my food!  The seating is very cramped and sometimes you have to sit really close, if not right next to a party at a 2-top beside you, beside some other party, who might consist of a little boy in a booster seat and his Mom. END
BEGIN NOW       The last morning I was there 2 people were on a blind date on our left. END
BEGIN NOW      They didn't seem to hit it off. END
BEGIN NOW      The art is very strange in here, it makes me giggle, and the decor could use an update. END
BEGIN NOW      New wallpaper wouldn't be a bad place to start. END
BEGIN NOW      They could also stand to replace the screen door and clean the windows in front. END
BEGIN NOW       Seriously, the front door is painted wood, and it looks like the Dickens. END
BEGIN NOW       It would make someone more OCD than me want to slather Purell on their hands. END
BEGIN NOW      I could seriously bump this place up to 4-stars but I don't want to mislead people about our humble neighborhood cafe. END
BEGIN NOW       Props to Frankie for taking me here for the first time 4 years ago. END
BEGIN NOW      It's like the Pete's Egg Nest (of Seattle) in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW     Went here for brunch with a friend recently and was pleasantly surprised. END
BEGIN NOW      It was a beautiful day out in Oakland, so we decided to sit outside on their back patio. END
BEGIN NOW      I really liked it out there and it was a very quaint atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW      Service, price, and ambiance definitely 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW      Food was about 3. END
BEGIN NOW     5 for me. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered the Eggs a la Justin (that's my partner's name so I felt extra inclined haha) and I really liked that it came with a good size portion of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW      However, the hollandaise sauce was watery compared to other times I've had a benedict. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend ordered the Italian Fritatta and it was huge! She could only eat half before she threw in the towel. END
BEGIN NOW      I had a bite and the egg was good, but the veggies seemed a little greasy. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, a really good experience and with huge portions for the price, I'll definitely be back next time in the Lake Merritt area!. END
BEGIN NOW     Tripping down memory lane @ Oakland's Lakeshore District, we found this spot. END
BEGIN NOW      Great, friendly service, the food was EXACTLY what I wanted to eat! The space is cramped but cool. END
BEGIN NOW      The beer selection is right on. END
BEGIN NOW      Superb!. END
BEGIN NOW     LOVElovelovelovellove their food but not very handicap friendly. END
BEGIN NOW      I was a regular here when I lived in the area and will drive out and deal with Grand Ave parking to eat here. END
BEGIN NOW      So, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW      Its worth it. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is great and the food is outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW     This place is a great hole in the wall, breakfast and brunch spot. END
BEGIN NOW      Perfect for when you want a delicious and hearty hangover brunch, but don't want to wait or pay to dine at a trendy East Bay spot. END
BEGIN NOW      I've never had to wait in line to eat here, which is always refreshing. END
BEGIN NOW      The food is home-style cooking for sure and the atmosphere is super casual. END
BEGIN NOW      I always order the same thing- Eggs Benedict a la Justin- I can't bring myself to branch out and order anything else because it's always so satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW      This place is easy on the wallet, which is always a plus. END
BEGIN NOW      My one critique would be their potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      Not flavorful enough. END
BEGIN NOW      Def need a good deal of hot sauce and ketchup to make up for the void of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW     Took the girlfriend to an early morning breakfast for the July 4th holiday. END
BEGIN NOW      We were the first people to enter and had choice of seating but couldn't seat in the window side booth reserved for 3 or more. END
BEGIN NOW      uh, the place is empty but ok. END
BEGIN NOW      expecting a big rush I get it. END
BEGIN NOW      The service was lackluster and barely acknowledged. END
BEGIN NOW      It shouldn't have happened considering we were the only ones in the place. END
BEGIN NOW      The coffee? Gross, tasted burnt and bitter. END
BEGIN NOW      Ordered the Eggs a la Justin. END
BEGIN NOW      Beautiful poached eggs with a mediocre hollandaise sauces. END
BEGIN NOW      Served with potatoes which were cold and lacked flavor. END
BEGIN NOW      Over all the experience wasn't  all that. END
BEGIN NOW      there are many breakfast places nearby that I would gladly pick over this place again. END
BEGIN NOW     WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE THIS PLACE?  I am so confused. END
BEGIN NOW     The dishes were overpriced, and not that good. END
BEGIN NOW       I had the famous Huevos and was like, wtf?  I thought this was supposed to blow my mind (mind was blown with CONFUSION)Service was abysmal. END
BEGIN NOW     My really nice/kind boyfriend agreed, and he hardly has anything bad to say about anyone/anything. END
BEGIN NOW       We came here due to the high reviews, but will not be coming back. END
BEGIN NOW     Principally, the staff and the shape / decor of this (literal) hole in the wall make me almost a total fan. END
BEGIN NOW       On a block with the recent appearance of corky-fakey restaurant bars, Lynne and Lu's luncheonette is 1. END
BEGIN NOW      unpretentious 2. END
BEGIN NOW      adorable, and the food is decent tasting and cheap 3. END
BEGIN NOW      It's staffed by a l-o-v-e-l-y possibly Father-Daughter team, and two extremely personable cooks (who are visible over the counter). END
BEGIN NOW     It looks a little like a (yes, slightly run down) dollhouse room-- enlarged! The waitress and owner are simply so sweet, they make one feel sort of celebratory over a grilled ham and cheese with free side salad. END
BEGIN NOW      My friend had the sandwich, I had fruit (some of which was cut from way too close to the rind. END
BEGIN NOW      Cheapness!), a side o' cheese, and ala cart YUMMY salad. END
BEGIN NOW      I was charged a little for extra dressing(s). END
BEGIN NOW      Neither of us had drinks, but I still felt really good about the cool $20. END
BEGIN NOW      check. END
BEGIN NOW     When it's a rainy Sunday, you're craving bacon, and you've already taken your houseguest to your usual breakfast joint. END
BEGIN NOW     what do you do? You ask on your status update on Facebook for suggestions. END
BEGIN NOW     You ignore all said suggestions, and consult Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW     You remember this place from a brunch date with your girlfriends, and although you can't remember the menu to save your life, you come here anyway because you don't remember it being horrible. END
BEGIN NOW     I should point out that I'm a big fan of McDonald's McGriddle sandwich, even though it most likely has more calories than you ate all through your (anorexic) senior year of high school. END
BEGIN NOW       Just kidding, kids, I was only anorexic for half of the year. END
BEGIN NOW     This place has the healthier equivalent of a McGriddle- Lynn's Breakfast: waffle, eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW       The bacon was not great, but it's bacon, so you really can't go wrong. END
BEGIN NOW       Eggs over medium were fine, and the waffle was thin, which is nice because Belgian waffles can just be too big. END
BEGIN NOW       The houseguest had a frittata. END
BEGIN NOW      and it seemed to handle his hangover well. END
BEGIN NOW       Prices not too shabby, but I really wish these places would upgrade on the coffee. END
BEGIN NOW     Cons:  It is tiny, and we were sat right next to the "kitchen," after waiting for what seemed to a bit, it would have been nice to get a less crappy table. END
BEGIN NOW       Other than that, not bad, although I don't know if I would take an out-of-town guest here again. END
BEGIN NOW     A cute little space. END
BEGIN NOW      Tables for two along the side walls and a line of 2-tops in the center of the room that was being used as communal dining. END
BEGIN NOW     The g/f ordered the smoked salmon omelette with bearnaise sauce and I got the Willi's omelette which is chicken apple sausage, scallions, and provolone cheese. END
BEGIN NOW      Both are off the Weekend Brunch menu. END
BEGIN NOW     Lynn &amp; Lu's definitely gets props for the size of the dishes. END
BEGIN NOW      The 3-egg omelettes, potatoes, toast, and wedge of orange filled the plates edge to edge. END
BEGIN NOW      I really liked the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW      They were nice and moist and the dollop of sour cream was just right. END
BEGIN NOW      The omelettes were also well stuffed with their respective ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW     Volume of food aside, the omelettes were just OK. END
BEGIN NOW      The smoked salmon omelette was a little boring with a nice pile of smoked salmon and nothing else inside. END
BEGIN NOW      The bearnaise on top didn't add too much to it. END
BEGIN NOW      For the Willi's, the provolone cheese was a big 1. END
BEGIN NOW     5" x 4" and third of an inch thick mass of cheese literally exploding out of one side of the omelette. END
BEGIN NOW      It would have been better more evenly distributed throughout the omelette. END
BEGIN NOW      The eggs were nice and fluffy in both. END
BEGIN NOW     Service was friendly, efficient, and young. END
BEGIN NOW      I felt like I was being served by my high-school aged niece and her BFFs. END
BEGIN NOW     Food 3+ starsService 4 starsOverall 3. END
BEGIN NOW     5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW     Don't get me wrong, this place had some wonderful service and felt like a nice, neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW      The prices were affordable. END
BEGIN NOW      I can see why people like this place but was surprised (and not in a pleasant way) after reading all the ratings. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe we just ordered the wrong items but we went for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW      My poached eggs over spinach and mushroom was just disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW      The poached eggs were fine but underseasoned. END
BEGIN NOW      The spinach and mushroom though sauteed were in a bowl of broth (I don't believe that was intended) and tasted like something I make once a week at home. END
BEGIN NOW      My SO's brunch plate consisted of home fries and an omelette with some cheese and other things. END
BEGIN NOW      It was okay. END
BEGIN NOW      Because of the price and atmosphere I would likely go back on a lazy Saturday or Sunday especially if it's a nice, sunny one, but otherwise will probably look elsewhere for some affordable brunch options. END
BEGIN NOW     After spending some time at the Victory Garden on Lake Merritt I REALLY wanted a classic breakfast with some eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm new to the Adam's Point area and haven't seen any diners by Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW      Afraid my boyfriend and I weren't going to find a diner on Grand, we continued past all the cafes and Asian restaurants and happened upon Lynn &amp; Lu's Escapade Cafe. END
BEGIN NOW      It was really crowded, the couple of tables outside were already taken and it looked like all the tables inside were taken too. END
BEGIN NOW      Except for one table for two! We grabbed the seat and were given menus promptly. END
BEGIN NOW      (I later found out there was a patio in the back for more customers to sit at! Next time I come here I'll have to check it out!) I ordered the Eggs A La Justin, which is an Eggs Benedict but instead of ham a HALF of an avocado. END
BEGIN NOW     And you get two of these guys so you're really given a whole avocado! All their egg breakfast specials come with country potatoes, so I nommed on a side of those too. END
BEGIN NOW      I also had coffee, which tasted a little burnt, but it wasn't so bad that I didn't want to drink it. END
BEGIN NOW       The boyfriend had Willy's Omelette, which came with slices of chicken apple sausage, green onions, and provolone cheese. END
BEGIN NOW       It looked good, but I'm not an omelette fan and didn't try any. END
BEGIN NOW      Overall, very good tasting food with big portions. END
BEGIN NOW      Both our dishes were $8. END
BEGIN NOW     50 so for the price I feel you get more than you pay for. END
BEGIN NOW      Service is a little hectic, but very friendly. END
BEGIN NOW     omg very excited about this place, wish I lived closer. END
BEGIN NOW      I had the potatoes escapade, which was everything I love on top of potatoes (another thing I love) and I added 2 eggs on top. END
BEGIN NOW      The only thing that grossed me out was the stomach churning amount of oil/butter at the bottom when I finished my plate. END
BEGIN NOW      It was worth it though. END
BEGIN NOW     The outdoor balcony area is sort of charming in a run-down cottage type of way. END
BEGIN NOW      There are some steep stairs leading up so be careful. END
BEGIN NOW     Was very surprised to find out it's owned by asian people!. END
BEGIN NOW     BlackstoneIt's the bud of a flower which makes my experience at Lynn &amp; Lu's Escapade Café an enjoyable one. END
BEGIN NOW      The typical acidic taste of this bud is lost in the cooking process and replaced with a creamy texture similar to avocado with a hint of green. END
BEGIN NOW      The combination works surprising well with the hollandaise sauce and the poached eggs (which look like cream puffs). END
BEGIN NOW       The incorporation of artichokes into Eggs Benedict is a must if you eat, have a pulse, drink water and/or breathe air. END
BEGIN NOW      Artichokes are serious underrated vegetables which can be transformed and made to please the large spectrum of taste buds we've been given. END
BEGIN NOW      If you are in love with Artichokes (as I am) and would like to know more about its awesomeness check out wiki's info. END
BEGIN NOW       WallsHave you ever been to the little cafes of Amsterdam in which you could sit back and smoke "tobacco"? The cafes are usually housed in old buildings with high ceilings and chipping walls. END
BEGIN NOW      The tables tend to be small, the room cold and the view none existing. END
BEGIN NOW      No? Me neither. END
BEGIN NOW      but I have seen many French films (Amélie &amp; The Professional) to know what I'm talking about. END
BEGIN NOW      In Paris (&amp; Amsterdam) I would be known as a spécialiste. END
BEGIN NOW      Lynn &amp; Lu's Escapade Café has the feeling I described above. END
BEGIN NOW      The walls tend to be covered in local art that is usually bad, not framed and tagged for sell with post-its. END
BEGIN NOW      I get that we must support local artists, but let's only support good art that enhances the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW      I say "good" art because I took an art history class at Laney eight years ago and. END
BEGIN NOW     I know art. END
BEGIN NOW      FinI return to this café because the food is good, affordable, the service is quick and the staff is attentive. END
BEGIN NOW      You should check it out. END

BEGIN NOW     I love a brunch place that has no waiting, quick service and good food. END
BEGIN NOW     I hail from the city of angeles, and it's hard to find a down to earth brunch place without all the snot nose people sitting next to you in their designer duds and mind numbing conversations. END
BEGIN NOW     I came here on a Saturday afternoon and did not have to wait for a table. END
BEGIN NOW      We decided on the eggs lox, an omelet and fritas. END
BEGIN NOW      It must have been a mere 5 minutes later that our food arrived nice and hot. END
BEGIN NOW      The coffee is not that great, think Denny's status. END
BEGIN NOW     Good portion size and the price was even better. END
BEGIN NOW     I'm use to paying about 15 dollars for eggs benedict but this was about 9 dollars and just as good if not better than what I have had at other places. END
BEGIN NOW      This is nothing that makes you go goo goo gaga over, but more so if you want something close to home-made but you're just too damn lazy to make it yourself. END
BEGIN NOW     Tasty breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW      Surprisingly busy for a Monday morning, but nonetheless the service was on point and the chow was yum and in great supply. END
BEGIN NOW      Had the oatmeal pancake +blueberry sauce and a nice chicken sausage, tasted the huevos rancheros too (they're good!). END
BEGIN NOW      We will definitely return, especially since Lynn &amp; Lu's is within easy walking distance. END
BEGIN NOW     I used to come here after running racing around the lake with the Lake Merrit Runner's &amp; Striders club on every last Sunday of the month. END
BEGIN NOW      Bottom line, this place has charm, fantastic friendly service, great selection of breakfast plates and the food is excellent. END
BEGIN NOW      I've had Justin's and Escapade, both very tasty and good size portions. END
BEGIN NOW      And it's super affordable. END
BEGIN NOW      Love supporting mom and pops shops too. END
BEGIN NOW     Came here for lunch today after reading all the good reviews but sadly, I wasn't too impressed. END
BEGIN NOW      I got the Eggs Jacqueline, which is two poached eggs topped with Meunster cheese, all over a bed of spinach. END
BEGIN NOW      Well, there was just TOO much cheese on this thing! I normally can't wait to devour any kind of breakfast plate but this looked really unappetizing. END
BEGIN NOW     Not going to give up though because the pictures others have posted look delish - I'll just get something more traditional next time, like Eggs Benedict (don't know why I didn't order that in the first place anyway, I always get that wherever I go). END
BEGIN NOW     For about $8 a plate, it is a lot of food though! Service is very good too. END
BEGIN NOW      Plus they're Asian, so 3 stars it is (started off at a 2). END
BEGIN NOW     Cute little place that reminds me of the cafe I used to work at in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW     Me and the guy had breakfast here. END
BEGIN NOW      Great service, alright food. END
BEGIN NOW      Menu was impressive. END
BEGIN NOW     I had an omelet without cheese or sour cream while he had a scramble without sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW      Our requests were granted without screw-up, but my omelet was swimming in grease. END
BEGIN NOW      Potatoes were nicely spiced. END
BEGIN NOW      Wheat toast was well-toasted and thin. END
BEGIN NOW     Prices reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW      No big complaints. END
BEGIN NOW     Returned to an Oakland favorite, a great way to start 2014!  The Oatmeal pancakes were as good as I remembered, with the option of blueberry or maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW       Eggs mixed with spinach, avocado, tomatoes onions and cheese were yummy. END
BEGIN NOW       Potatoes were perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned and the chicken apple sausage was a good complement. END
BEGIN NOW      Came in on a Friday afternoon, so missed the weekend crowd, service was quick and pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW       No AMEX. END
BEGIN NOW     I will forever remember this place as the diner with the sticky tables and the bad Hollandaise. END
BEGIN NOW     I give my people's props for their tasty breakfast and attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW      It's nice to see a Chinese-owned business doing well. END
BEGIN NOW      Cheers my Sugah-peoples!!!. END
BEGIN NOW     I was excited to try this place after reading many positive reviews - but really, it was just "Eh, it's ok" rather than "A-Ok" - however, I'm adding the extra star because the wait staff was just so darn friendly and outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW      I LOVE breakfast and for me it's an easy meal that is kinda hard to mess up. END
BEGIN NOW     but here's why I won't be going back: 1. END
BEGIN NOW      Bacon. END
BEGIN NOW      I'm picky about my bacon. END
BEGIN NOW      This was way too thick and undercooked (even though it looked well done - it was super chewy). END
BEGIN NOW      This may work for some - NOT for me. END
BEGIN NOW      2. END
BEGIN NOW      The "home potatoes" had a weird non-breakfast type seasoning on them. END
BEGIN NOW      Maybe rosemary? I think they would have fit better as a dinner side. END
BEGIN NOW      It totally clashed with the breakfast flavors. END
BEGIN NOW      3. END
BEGIN NOW      Pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW      I ordered them "well done" and they came out well. END
BEGIN NOW     rubbery. END
BEGIN NOW      I drowned the suckers in the warm blueberry sauce (which is great, BTW) and that was pretty much the bulk of my meal. END
BEGIN NOW      My eggs were a bit on the greasy side. END
BEGIN NOW      4. END
BEGIN NOW      Hubbs ordered the Eggs a la Justin. END
BEGIN NOW     we didn't understand the appeal. END
BEGIN NOW      Poached eggs shouldn't be THAT underdone and the flavors were a bit too exotic at 8:15am :-( If you're looking for "gourmet breakfast" on a shoestring budget - this is the place to go! It's small inside, but the food comes out quickly and the staff is super attentive - never had to ask for coffee refills. END
BEGIN NOW      BUT. END
BEGIN NOW     I just wanted good-ole basic breakfast, so it didn't really work for me. END
BEGIN NOW     I guess I'm boring like that ;-). END
