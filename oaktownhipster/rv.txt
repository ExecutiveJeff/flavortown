Really cool atmosphere
 I absolutely LOVED the music selection
 Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted)
 Drinks were great, well priced
 Friendly bar staff
 I'd recommend to friends

Definitely a dive
 Terrible DJ
 And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music


I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able
 But on the upside, it's easy to find
 And there's a lot of seating, which I loved

The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery
 I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square
 After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening
 Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over
 I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order
There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area
 With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end
 I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd
 The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night
 Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty
 The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip)
If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light

The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch
 The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover
As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly
 Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs

Oh, hello white people of Oakland
 Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops
 Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious
 Thank you, we hardly noticed

On the intro act, the power went out 3 times
 I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train
 They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first
 :(
I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!
My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend
 We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times
 Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time
 The bouncer was funny and inviting
 If you're in the area, go and have fun!
The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar
  There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much
 The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look
 The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable
 The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to
 The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event
 But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself
 Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends
 If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light

Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes
JOHNNY is the man
 He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste
The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing 

 from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin

Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people
 Laid back grungy hipster vibe
 Music was loud and I felt at home

Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland
 The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night
 No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom
 Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started

It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party
  The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland


Cool ass people in there!
What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5
 Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude
 The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back
 We were singing along and dancing
 If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back

Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment
 Will definitely be back

Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland
  After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place
  Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices
I'll be back!
The Night Light is the worlds best bar
 Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up
 I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me
 I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way
 I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape

Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland
 Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying
 The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had
 You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light

I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square
 Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable

Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing
 They always have a DJ on the weekends
 The photo booth is all kinds of fun
 Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere
 The bar area and staff is nice
 Prices aren't too bad for JLS
 Looking forward to being back soon

This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor
 BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch
 I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft
 His words exactly, "My bar, my money"
 I had good reason to file a report with the BBB
 Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey
 Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server
 I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles
 I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology
 Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous
 I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position

It's cool bar
  Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city
  Many of us like it just the way it is
 Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars

Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl
 Fun times

I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out
  Reviews do not lie
 The place is casual, relaxed, friendly
 Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music
 Everyone there seemed to be having a good time
 Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local

So
 much
 whiskey
 Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet
 The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night
 They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches
 They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face
It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking
 Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music
 I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland

I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby
 It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks')
 What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time
 More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!
The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos)
 The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents
 I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part
 Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise)
 Overall, a-ok :)
This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service
  Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good
  Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5
00 is totally worth it
  NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none

This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch
Drinking with your friends
Having another one
And the fun never ends
Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley
Drinking with your friends
Having another one
The fun never ends
Or when you are hanging out at Fest
Drinking with your friends
Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end
Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends

This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening
 It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too

Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square
 They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients
 The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present
 The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works

This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing
Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company
 Love you guys, keep rocking it

The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods
a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music
 space isn't that big
 you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink
on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back

Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things
 Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger
 For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did
 But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night
 And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail
 The Night Light is brand new
 Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there
 The interior is cush and luxurious
 Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355
 The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging
 I enjoyed the sound they had going
 Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home
 I tried and loved the Wild and Free
 Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye
 Both were 8 bucks each
 Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap
 They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out
 Night light, I hope you are here to stay
 Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :)
The owner doug really cares about this place
 Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously

Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area
 I was very surprised that this was here
 I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice
 The decor makes this spot feel trendy
 There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor
 I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy
 I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT
 This is a great spot

Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution
 Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great
  The happy hour prices are awesome
  For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs
  Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop

The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened
I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service
  Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend
  These guys deserve a crowd
Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site

Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster
  If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least
  The venue is really small, but breathes character
  Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer
  Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par
  This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around
  You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here
  Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing
  Awesome place to catch up with old friends
  Drinks are definitely stiff
Wait staff is not pretentious at all
PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned
  Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either

Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood
 It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music
I haven't gone to any shows yet

Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight)
 My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry
Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye

My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night
  We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up
The doorman was awesome
  He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars
The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper
  That's 4 stars
  Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like
  Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often
However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here
  Hence, the 2 stars - "meh
 i've experienced better
"The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc)
  So that was fine
But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay
  Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients
  Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced
One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him
  She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner)
  Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends
Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail
  Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them
To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed
  There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around
  But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients
  Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly
  I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening
 They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out
 However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back
To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar
  And it wasn't a special occasion
  And there were a lot of people in the bar
There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet
  Let's hope they get it together

They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk
 In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey
 Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails
 All of this on their second night
 Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood

This place is great
 Always good tunes spinning
 Really good happy hour
 Friendly bartenders
 Great for after work

This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland
 We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come
 Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize
 The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen
 You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place
 If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you
 The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff
 The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations
 Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever
 He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us
 We shared stories and hung out
 He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went 
 "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah
 I own the Nightlight"
 The rest is history
 All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight
 Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face
 Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people

At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar
 Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time
 What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate
 Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks
 Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls
 What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service
 I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat

Fantastic cocktails
Friendly and knowledgeable staff
  And I love the decor
I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue

My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times
" All in all, a really fun, adorable bar

Went here recently for happy hour


 what can I say? I'm a fan
   Love the decor
  On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends


 something I appreciate
  My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work
  Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages
  "I'll be back
"
Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night
From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe
With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time
Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville
 It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele
Works out great for us Oaklanders
 Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop



Freaking awesome
 The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows
 Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!
Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams
 Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends

This place is amazing
  I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!
I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences
  We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu
 The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice

Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing
  Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too
  Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable
  Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times

This is really the only reason I go out after dark
 Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs
 The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people
 Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here
 Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance)
And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately
 But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies
 If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home
Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs
Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS
Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast

The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink
 I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures
 The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel
 Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink
 As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table
 This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room
 We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music


but that may be part of it's eclectic charm
 I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails
 Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok
 Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away
 Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks


but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better

This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit
Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s
 The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror
 There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you
 The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups
 The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space
 All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space
Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area
 The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers
 I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients
 Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second
 I also had a decent Manhattan
 Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber
 They also had some beers on tap
The service was very good
 My bartender was attentive and very friendly
 I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate
 A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient
Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field
 While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path
 While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer
 Four Stars

Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better
 Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar
  They now accept all major credit cards
 The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics
  The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu
 They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon
P
S
 I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!
Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good

great drinks, awesome atmosphere!
I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar
 I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open
 So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a
 Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did
 I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place
 I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place
 I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it
 It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth
 We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners
  They were super cool and the service was great
 We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good
  They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar
 To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit
 Cheers!
Went on opening night and was impressed
  No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd
  Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed
  I'll definitely be back!
Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor
 The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff
 This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time
 Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect

Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces
  From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style
  The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun
  They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?)
  By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years
  Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again
  Can't wait to go back !
Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night
 My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT
 Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders
 The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes
 5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about

Really cool atmosphere
 I absolutely LOVED the music selection
 Could've turned the music down  a little (it was a little distorted)
 Drinks were great, well priced
 Friendly bar staff
 I'd recommend to friends

Definitely a dive
 Terrible DJ
 And I don't just mean that they didn't play my kind of music


I mean that the music was all over the place: just when the dancing got started, the music would shift to something totally undance-able
 But on the upside, it's easy to find
 And there's a lot of seating, which I loved

The Night Light was quite the surprise discovery
 I met up with some friends for a birthday celebration on Friday night that kicked off at Plank in Jack London Square
 After finishing up a game of bowling, we were in need of a new bar for the rest of the evening
 Luckily one of my friends knew about about The Night Light, so we made the short walk over
 I was expecting a mediocre dive spot when we first entered, but my first impressions were corrected in short order
There is apparently an upstairs area that is used for concerts but we stayed in downstairs area
 With regard to the downstairs portion of the place, there is a bar with stools that runs the length of the place, some more comfy seats along the opposite wall, and a DJ booth and small dance floor at the far end
 I thought I was going to bumping into people all night long, but to my pleasant surprise, everyone was extremely chill and there was plenty of space on the dancefloor despite a healthy crowd
 The DJ played a great mix of hip hop throughout the night
 Ignoring an initial failed attempt at making an Old Fashioned, the rest of the cocktails for the evening were well-made and tasty
 The drinks were also reasonably priced (3 for $24 before tip)
If in the Jack London Square area and looking for a good place to dance and grab a drink, definitely checkout The Night Light

The Night Light might look divey from the outside, but the downstairs portion is great for large groups, has a lively, fun vibe on weekend nights, and offers decently priced drinks that pack quite a punch
 The upstairs portion often hosts live acts for a modest cover
As with many Oakland establishments, it's the clientele that really makes things, and, true to Oakland's reputation, the crowds here are diverse and friendly
 Worth a visit either for chilling out downstairs or checking out a live act upstairs

Oh, hello white people of Oakland
 Are we cramping your 'style'? Oops
 Concerning when a bar experiences an influx of a color unbeknownst to them and makes it completely obvious
 Thank you, we hardly noticed

On the intro act, the power went out 3 times
 I missed most of the headline act b/c i had to catch the last BART train
 They couldn't hire an electrician to check the system first
 :(
I come here mostly for The Hanging Garden nights, which I might add are now TWO FLOORS of all my favorite classic goth, new wave and synthpop (read: dance club!)  Highly recommend going early it does get packed but you will have fun and get sweaty!
My friend and I were in the bay area for the weekend
 We were walking down Washington St and heard Michael Jackson playing, so we went in!Super fun night! Very chill and laid back, cheap drinks, great DJ and good times
 Everyone who was there just wanted to have a good time
 The bouncer was funny and inviting
 If you're in the area, go and have fun!
The Night Light is a perfectly serviceable little bar, upstairs over another bar
  There's not much to the venue, it's just one room and fairly small, but it's got that dive bar vibe that I like so much
 The decor, the velvet wallpaper, and the dim lighting all give it a casually-classy speakeasy look
 The staff and bartender were all friendly, we got our drinks quickly and the cost (for cover and drinks) was reasonable
 The only issue I had was that the small venue size didn't really work with the event I went to
 The venue atmosphere worked perfectly for the theme of the event, but there was barely enough standing room for the large crowd, let alone for the swing dancing they were advertising for the event
 But that was more on the event organizers and not on the bar itself
 Night Light seems like my kind of bar, a nice dark hidey hole to drink away a few hours with your friends
 If I lived nearby, I could totally see myself being a regular at the Night Light

Came in here to kill some time to eat some sushi next door and ended up staying here longer than usual because of the great service and awesome vibes
JOHNNY is the man
 He greets you as you come in, asks you what drink your in the mood for, let's you know what he has in stock, and makes the drink for you with great taste
The man even remembers my name and checks up on me to see how I'm doing 

 from the bar (as I'm seated from across the room)! Love this guy!Johnnyyyyy, you're the man, keep doin what you're doin

Loved the bartenders! They took shots of patron with me, little expensive, 10$ per shot but cool people
 Laid back grungy hipster vibe
 Music was loud and I felt at home

Went to The Night Light to a benefit show for a musician that was slain recently in Oakland
 The venue seemed really small at first but it was a great night
 No comments on the drinks or restroom since all I drank was water ( I was the DD) and never had to use the restroom
 Just beware where you park!! I was lucky enough to end up in the parking garage and we found out that one of the bands vans was broken into before the show even started

It was a cool place to chill out after our job's X-Mas party
  The dj had good music and I kinda forgot I was in Oakland


Cool ass people in there!
What a gem we found last night! Casual ambiance, no cover, great dj! Photobooth inside but it costs $5
 Bartenders were nice and didn't have a poor attitude
 The DJ was playing all the 90 hitters which brought us back
 We were singing along and dancing
 If this DJ plays every Saturday night, I wouldn't mind coming back

Cool place, great drinks, fantastic staff, and friendly environment
 Will definitely be back

Fun place that I've hit a few times while going to concerts in Oakland
  After about 5pm they have a DJ in the corner of this dark and leathery place
  Good music, happy people, good drinks!Mixology is emphasized here with many artisan style cocktails at fair prices
I'll be back!
The Night Light is the worlds best bar
 Epic vibe, good drink, truly a solid place to turn up
 I left my card on the counter not knowing and one of the bar tenders ran it out to me
 I think his name was Jason or Charles, either way
 I will be back, but this time I'm bringing my Vape

Definitely my favorite bar in Oakland
 Perfect for some casual after work drinks or weekend partying
 The bald white dude (Jason I think?) makes the best margarita I've ever had
 You're missing out if you're not drinking at The Night Light

I like this place well enough, but not my favorite place in Jack London Square
 Last Friday is a good place to be and happy hour price is reasonable

Awe, My absolute favorite spot to go in JLS for an after dinner drink and dancing
 They always have a DJ on the weekends
 The photo booth is all kinds of fun
 Cozy couches everywhere in the dark atmosphere
 The bar area and staff is nice
 Prices aren't too bad for JLS
 Looking forward to being back soon

This bar seems like it has good vibe and a classy demeanor
 BUT, the bad apple spoils the bunch
 I got my change stolen by the bar tender Charles twice! The second time while I was calling him out for such a petty theft
 His words exactly, "My bar, my money"
 I had good reason to file a report with the BBB
 Lucky for Night Light owners I was talked down by the superior bar tender Casey
 Casey not only made me feel comfortable, but returned my stolen change, and insured me Charles would no longer be our server
 I honestly feel bad for Casey because he has to share his tips with Charles
 I feel even worse for Charles because he did not even realize he had spoiled his bed enough to offer an apology
 Customer service is not for everyone but when drugs, alcohol, and ego are in the mix things can become dangerous
 I had a terrible experience but I would go back if I saw a hot enough girl in there, and poor Charles had been relieved of the stress of a front of house position

It's cool bar
  Those kids who seem to complain, go back to the city
  Many of us like it just the way it is
 Chill music, chill staff, chill regulars

Great little bar that had Anchor Christmas ale on tap, nudie paintings in ornate frames, and a couple of cool Sunday night DJs that spun some goth and industrial tunes--yes, vinyl
 Fun times

I read so many great reviews about this place I had to check it out
  Reviews do not lie
 The place is casual, relaxed, friendly
 Awesome bartenders and DJ plays excellent music
 Everyone there seemed to be having a good time
 Highly recommended if you are from out of town or if you are a local

So
 much
 whiskey
 Definitely more than I've ever seen in a dive bar - though I guess this is slightly above that, but not quite one of those pretentious mixology places yet
 The bartenders are friendly, and took care of everyone, even though they were slammed on a Friday night
 They checked back in with us regularly, and chatted with us to recommend different scotches
 They know their stuff, but they don't rub it in your face
It seemed like the upstairs bar through the other entrance was for dancing, and downstairs is for drinking
 Wish they did have a dance floor though, because they were playing great music
 I'm adding the Night Light to my usual list (The Layover, Bar 355) for the perfect trifecta of bars in Oakland

I don't remember much about this place, except that I came after striking out at the other bars nearby
 It seemed cute (and dark) inside and the drinks were fine (male bartender was super nice and didn't look down on me for getting 'beginner's drinks')
 What I REALLY remember was back to back fantastic 80's songs (along the lines of Fleetwood Mac) and having a great time
 More people should go and get a better crowd assembled!
The Night Light is a quaint lil' spot in Oakland (conveniently across a Dominos)
 The inside is reminiscent of a speakeasy; red walls adorn the room with low lighting and black accents
 I would say that this spot should admit about 25 people only to allow for ample space, but that's a guestimation on my part
 Bands play a little too loud for this venue and I would say jazz acoustic music would be preferable (decibel-level wise)
 Overall, a-ok :)
This place has upstairs and downstairs, both with bars, both accept cards, and both have good service
  Upstairs also has a stage where they have live music, and the sound quality is surprisingly good
  Parking is not difficult at night, it is easy to get to and from the freeway, and the cover of $5
00 is totally worth it
  NOTE: The cover only is applicable to upstairs for live music, downstairs has none

This place reminds me of those timeswhen you are hanging on the front porch
Drinking with your friends
Having another one
And the fun never ends
Or as a kid when you are hanging in the alley
Drinking with your friends
Having another one
The fun never ends
Or when you are hanging out at Fest
Drinking with your friends
Having a great timeand the fun never endsAnd then that timeI was at the Night Light hangin' with Titograbbing some drinks and the fun never seemed to end
Until we were going down Broadway to grab him some cigsRho and Dottie show up for a good timebut so do the pigsSo we go back inside the Night Light for another drinkAnd the fun never ends

This spot turns out good drinks and seems to cater to a more mature (30s and 40s) clientele, at least on a recent Thursday evening
 It can get loud, but hey, it's a music venue too

Cool and unpretentious pub near Jack London Square
 They have a good selection of interesting cocktails made with some organic ingredients
 The decor is Spartan leather and the music is loud, though offering a groovy mix, especially when a live DJ is present
 The space has the feel of being a warehouse with some furniture and a bar, but it works

This place is classy, sexy, hip and overall amazing
Will always be my place to go when I need a drink and good company
 Love you guys, keep rocking it

The Night Light (b/w Nation"s &amp; souley vegan) has been resurrected as a sensual drinking hole with brown tones, brown woods and stylish nudes on the woods
a relaxed mood is enhanced by the easy listening r &amp; b music
 space isn't that big
 you beat the rush by going to happy hours, every day, 4-8-well drinks(4)-draft beers (4?)-specialty drinks ($1 off)drink: gin &amp; tonic (4)-heavy pour, 1 1/2 oz gin, i hearlady from the sea (9)-rum, cane sugar, and ?just a sweet drink
on draught-6 micros on draft-bill, the bartender ,is cool, laid back

Night light, my you do shine bright! Tucked between Ginza and Nations on Broadway, not too far from Beer Rev and Souley Vegan, It's a stone's throw away from many favorite things
 Five stars alone for the fact there's another stellar drinking establishment close to my favorite toasty crispy burger
 For me, Night Light screams, "Ladies, drop your man off at boyfriend daycare (Beer Rev) and come grab a yummy nautical themed cocktail with your girlfriends!" Not to say that boyfriend didn't like it, nono, he did
 But sometimes, dare I say, it's just not a beer night
 And sometimes, after said delicious toasty crispy, I'd really enjoy a cocktail
 The Night Light is brand new
 Yup, mm that new paint twinge is still there
 The interior is cush and luxurious
 Dimly lit with lots of leather seating, it begs the question, is there a nautical wench waiting for a suitor upstairs? It struck me that the design is eerily similar to 355
 The space, however, is much more open and conducive to lounging
 I enjoyed the sound they had going
 Boyfriend and I just stopped in for a quick cocktail on our way home
 I tried and loved the Wild and Free
 Boyfriend enjoyed his high on Rye
 Both were 8 bucks each
 Didn't break the bank although I wouldn't call it exactly cheap
 They don't accept credit cards which is a little annoying but nothing we couldn't figure out
 Night light, I hope you are here to stay
 Especially if your co-owner Doug was serious about his promise of unlimited free drinks :)
The owner doug really cares about this place
 Although I didn't have the best experience here, I am willing to give it another try because doug really takes his work seriously

Had a few cocktails to celebrate by birthday after having dinner in the area
 I was very surprised that this was here
 I really enjoyed my drink and the furniture was nice
 The decor makes this spot feel trendy
 There are mostly dark colors and darker woods used in the decor
 I also like the wallpaper and it was fuzzy
 I only wish there was a little more ventilation, it was one hot summer night plus drinks was making it like HOT
 This is a great spot

Really fun place that is off the beaten path of Oakland bars and is always a good stop after Merchant's or Beer Revolution
 Lucy and Dougie keep the place going great
  The happy hour prices are awesome
  For some reason, the bar upstairs is run like a separate entity so each drink costs more so remember to order downstairs
  Your drink will still be scientifically poured into the jigger and not an extra drop

The neighborhood already has some amazing beer spots (Trappist and Beer Revolution), so it's about time a cocktail destination opened
I sampled 3 or 4 of the house cocktails and all were great, nice atmosphere and service
  Predictably quiet on a Tuesday around happy hour, so I hope that things pick up closer to the weekend
  These guys deserve a crowd
Cash only right now, but there is an ATM on site

Part divey, part mixology, and full blown hipster
  If any of those three appeal to you, definitely stop by for a drink at least
  The venue is really small, but breathes character
  Everyone from the owner, bartenders, and doorman treats you like a customer
  Service is fantastic, and they often come socialize with you on less busy nights to make sure everything is up to par
  This gives me hope that neighborhood divey places that serve mean cocktails are still around
  You won't hear the "UNCE UNCE UNCE" of EDM or top 40 here
  Instead you'll find ambient lighting and lounge rock playing
  Awesome place to catch up with old friends
  Drinks are definitely stiff
Wait staff is not pretentious at all
PROTIP:  They make an absolutely mean old fashioned
  Their whiskey selection is definitely not shabby either

Night Light is a great addition to the neighborhood
 It's a chill, unpretentious bar with a besuited doorman, good bartenders, good drinks, and really good music
I haven't gone to any shows yet

Classy! Lots of comfortable furniture and space (at least, there was on a weeknight)
 My bartender was kinda daffy but I wasn't in a hurry
Saw a show upstairs and really loved it -- the bartender up there was great, the lady at the door danced along, everyone was super nice and nobody was pretentious even though there's a big shelf full of rye

My group of friends and I (Oaklanders!) were stoked to check this place out on opening night
  We got there at 8:30, so it wasn't that late into the evening when we showed up
The doorman was awesome
  He was seriously the best thing about the night!  He gets 5 stars
The space looks really nice - the outside arches and fairy lights, the fuzzy interior wallpaper
  That's 4 stars
  Probably the worst thing about the experience was -- when we met the doorman, we were like "Man! This place is going to be awesome!"  We had really high expectations for what this place was going to be like
  Plus, our group of friends loves really hard on the Oakland bar scene, and JLS, and were hopeful that there would be a reason to head this way a little more often
However, it was really disappointing in the sense that I, and I think most of my friends, really feel no reason to go back here
  Hence, the 2 stars - "meh
 i've experienced better
"The cocktails on the menu were good tasting (if they had been mixed properly), and similar prices as other bars we love (Chop Bar in JLS, Van Kleef, Make Westing, Layover, etc)
  So that was fine
But the service?  The bartender I got a drink from was okay
  Only problem was that their first cocktail on the menu, the "Old Smokey" (something like that) was already unable to be made due to lack of ingredients
  Okay, so it's opening night and they're learning, but wouldn't you want to have a lot of the stuff on hand for your headlining cocktail?My drink was okay, but it wasn't mixed up at all, just everything layered, so it got kinda gross cuz I couldn't stir it and so had to drink up all the sweet stuff first, then when I could stir it, it was unbalanced
One friend reported that his bartender was actually really mean to him
  She was repeatedly shouting prices at people (in a not friendly manner, not in an "it's loud in here" manner)
  Also, for other drinks our friends got, the prices seemed to range wildly for the same drink - between $6-9 for the same drink within our group of friends
Later, when a friend returned to buy a drink for himself and his partner, he was told by a bartender that he couldn't order a cocktail
  Even though cocktails are on the menu and the other bartender was making them
To be fair, they were probably just understaffed and overwhelmed
  There seemed to be only two main bartenders, and one third who was partially making drinks and partially running around
  But why go somewhere to get such disappointing service? You'd think that you'd want to pull out all the stops on opening night, or at least just be prepared with enough staff and ingredients
  Or if you're not prepared, be friendly and gracious about it - smile maybe?  Most Oaklanders are understanding about shortages of drinks and staff, but not about being treated poorly
  I'd give this place another chance (based on the doorman alone, actually) to hopefully make some positive changes after a crappy friday night opening
 They're supposed to also have shows, which I'd go to check out
 However, there are so many better options that have their stuff together in Oakland, so I'm not in a hurry to go back
To illustrate why not, a couple Fridays ago, same group of friends ended up at Van Kleef and the owner was walking around passing out several rounds of complimentary tomatoes with vinegar/sea salt to everyone in the bar
  And it wasn't a special occasion
  And there were a lot of people in the bar
There's a reason I prefer to stay in Oakland to go out and skip San Francisco, and unfortunately, the Night Light isn't quite there, yet
  Let's hope they get it together

They have velvet wallpaper, leather man chairs and, at least when we were there, a propensity to lure people into many drinks followed by a late night Hulu marathon of Soul Train when you return home, maybe a bit drunk
 In case you were unaware this entire scenario goes well with whiskey
 Yes, they have whiskey and they know how to make it into delightful cocktails
 All of this on their second night
 Yes, I am looking forward to more of this good in the neighborhood

This place is great
 Always good tunes spinning
 Really good happy hour
 Friendly bartenders
 Great for after work

This is literally my girlfriend and my favorite night spot in Oakland
 We go to shows here regularly upstairs and Doug always gets great acts to come
 Once you walk into the place the vintage decor and mini living room setups make you feel right at home if you're looking for a cozy place to sit and socialize
 The DJs are always on point and play the best music but don't go in here expecting top 40 because that just isn't going to happen
 You can tell its just not a top 40 music kind of place
 If you want to hear music you have never heard before or something that will bring you back to time in your life when you had a funky hair cut then this is the spot for you
 The crowd always gets into the music and so does the staff
 The bar is always making great drinks and have good recommendations
 Doug is just the coolest guy most personable guy ever
 He came up and spoke to me and my girlfriend while we dancing at the Brothertiger show and he even danced with us
 We shared stories and hung out
 He took us over to the bar and walked behind it to get us drinks and my face went 
 "Are you allowed to do that?" I said and he goes "Yeah
 I own the Nightlight"
 The rest is history
 All in all if your a Oakland local or an out of towner anyone can enjoy the awesomeness that is the Nightlight
 Take all your friends here and introduce yourself to the kind gentleman who is their bouncer because he will remember your face
 Go here if youre looking for a good time with drinks music and good people

At risk of perpetuating gender binaries, I'm going to go out on a limb and call this a man bar
 Something I, even as a woman, crave from time to time
 What makes this a man bar, you say? Well, for starters, the clusters of stately brown leather chairs and sofas that look like they've been stolen from the library of an estate
 Sitting in these chairs makes you yearn for a pipe and scotch on the rocks
 Then there's the flocked wallpaper, exposed old-timey lighting, and the portraits of nudes languorously hanging from the walls
 What makes this place awesome is definitely the decor, but there's also a nice variety of liquors and friendly service
 I'd recommend stopping by on a Sunday when it's not too packed to get a seat

Fantastic cocktails
Friendly and knowledgeable staff
  And I love the decor
I am only speaking for the bar downstairs as I have never been to the upstairs venue

My little old lady heart went aflutter: Edison bulbs over the bar, velvet wallpaper, furniture with feet!  A bar tender with a Dali-meets-Cowboy mustache!! II ordered a whiskey ginger, and he sprinkled a little Worcestershire sauce on top--yum!! The doorman with a bulletproof vest was a teensy unnerving, especially after he clarified he just wore it because he'd been "shot at too many times
" All in all, a really fun, adorable bar

Went here recently for happy hour


 what can I say? I'm a fan
   Love the decor
  On the day I visited, there were DJs playing good music downstairs, but the volume was kept to a reasonable level so you could still talk to your friends


 something I appreciate
  My cocktails were fantastic, and you could tell the bartender takes pride in his work
  Seriously, some of the best cocktails I've had in ages
  "I'll be back
"
Aptly named and well-positioned, the latest addition to Broadway's booming West End is definitely lighting up the night
From the stately facade with the carnival-esque lights and Wild Wild West signage to the warm glow of a slew of crystal chandeliers and wall sconces, The Night Light is beaming the modern-urban-oasis-meets-sexed-up-saloon vibe
With vintage details abound, like the cash registers, the lush, leather club chairs, the bordello-esque wallpaper and boudoir paintings, the distinct crackle of vinyl over the Hi-Fi, and their own version of Miss Kitty (Miss Megan) behind the bar slingin' high-octane drinks, it's like a step back in time that is right ON time
Makes sense coming from the former owners of The Ivy Room in Albany and Kitty's in Emeryville
 It's not their first trip to the rodeo, they do seem to know a thing or two about attracting and keeping a hip and loyal clientele
Works out great for us Oaklanders
 Now the Uptown Crawl merges with the Downtown Crawl with other great haunts like The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Tamarindo and Haven and the Oaktown party don't stop



Freaking awesome
 The amount of work that these boys put into making this fantastic shows
 Way to make Oakland even more awesome!! Can't wait to come here when they put the sexy ladies on the wall and when their music venue opens- just freaking awesome!!
Not too crowded for a Friday! Good drinks! Good DJ spinnin old school jams
 Will definitely go back for a relaxed night out with friends

This place is amazing
  I highly recommend for great music, vibes, and drinks!
I have been here 2 times now, both were really good experiences
  We went for happy hour, I was thrilled at the whiskey selections! Tons of different types and a really interesting drink menu
 The bartenders were both really nice and helpful and the interior is really nice

Pretty cool place (ground floor speaking since I didn't get a chance to go upstairs), it definitely gets loud when the music is playing
  Bartenders are nice and the bouncer is friendly too
  Comfy chairs and spinning bar stools and prices are reasonable
  Lots of street parking but may have to drive around the block one or two times

This is really the only reason I go out after dark
 Which, granted, still doesn't happen as often as it should - there are regular awesome shows here featuring a bevy of great local garage bands upstairs, and some excellent DJs downstairs
 The decor is kind of stunning, the drinks are solid, the staff is a fantastic group of people
 Usually I'm wary of places that separate the stage/venue from the bar because there can be a weird dis-congruity between crowds, but it works pretty well here
 Even when there's a less-than-obvious show/DJ match up (like the psych-garage show with old-school hip-hop DJ night that'll pop up now and then) it still manages to feel comfortable moving back and forth, unlike the middle-school-dance complex many of these places can get (opposite sides of the room, *maybe* one or two brave souls crossing over to dance)
And in terms of service, yeah, it's a bar, sometimes you don't get your drink immediately
 But I'd rather be spending my Saturday night with good company and good drinks and good tunes than plop down somewhere where the bartender has nothing to do but sit in front of me and pour my bevvies
 If I'm just looking to get drunk quick I'll stay home
Pro-tip: regular Monday-night stand-up downstairs
Pro-tip 2: AC Transit late-night free shuttle b/t downtown &amp; JLS
Pro-tip 3: Nations next door is open until 1, but no late-night breakfast

The hubs and I stopped in for an after dinner drink
 I've did some research on yelp about this place and thought that this bar had a pretty cool vibe based on the interior pictures
 The decor is pretty neat with a speak easy feel
 Old leather wingbacked chairs and dark ornate wallpaper and wood paneling gives you the feeling that this is the type of place to enjoy a good stiff drink
 As much as it looked old-fashioned inside, it's really eclectic in that they have live music and a DJ table
 This probably is a great venue for bands to play because there's a lot of room
 We went early on a Friday evening so I'm sure this place probably gets really busy later on, but it was kind of weird thinking that the speakeasy ambiance of this joint would soon be filled with hip/hop or rock music


but that may be part of it's eclectic charm
 I would imagine that this place wouldn't be a great place to have a convo with a group of friends late at night due to the music they play, but probably for a happy hour style outing, this would be a good spot to sit and have a few cocktails
 Although we really liked the ambiance of this place, the cocktails were ok
 Their list of house cocktails looked really great and the couple that we ordered were good, but compared to some other bars that we frequent, they didn't blow us away
 Overall, It's a nice looking bar that's probably great for seeing a band or listening/dancing to music while having some drinks


but if you're looking for a quieter lounge type atmosphere with a bigger selection of drinks there are probably other bars in Oakland that would cater to that better

This review is based on a happy hour visit and a Saturday night visit
Aesthetically, Night Light harkens back to the 1920s
 The interior features a nicely finished wooden bar, and the alcohol is housed on brightly illuminated wooden shelving that frames a large mirror
 There are a number of bar stools for patrons looking to gaze at the alcohol (or themselves) while imbibing, yet not so many that you feel you're rubbing shoulders with the stranger next to you
 The rest of the surprisingly ample interior space comprises of a collection of comfortable (p)leather armchairs, loveseats, and side tables, all smartly arranged to accommodate smaller and larger groups
 The walls are wood paneled above a 1920s era wallpaper style, and an attractive chandelier and a couple of other ceiling lights dimly light the space
 All in all, it's an attractive, relaxing interior space
Night Light seems to be going for the small-batch, artisanal alcohol program, much like the other newer bars over in the Uptown area
 The cocktail menu was solid, but no more interesting than the various other artisanal cocktail menus that are popping up like wildflowers
 I ordered a drink off the cocktail menu (the name of which escapes me), and it was quite tasty yet unbalanced; the smokiness of the single-malt scotch overpowered the other ingredients
 Either way, it was good enough that I ordered a second
 I also had a decent Manhattan
 Drink prices (cocktails ranged from $8 - $10) were very fair for a bar of this caliber
 They also had some beers on tap
The service was very good
 My bartender was attentive and very friendly
 I observed him trying to serve people in a first-come, first-served fashion, which I always appreciate
 A second bartender also seemed to have the right idea - she appeared friendly and efficient
Bottom Line: Night Light is a solid newcomer in an increasingly crowded and competitive field
 While not without many merits, the drinks were not exceptional and (for me) it's a tad off the beaten path
 While I will definitely return and have already recommended Night Light to several people, it's not among the "best" bars Oakland has to offer
 Four Stars

Decided to give NL a second chance and what better time than around my birthday!  This time around was definitely better
 Service was exceptional at this speak easy bar
  They now accept all major credit cards
 The music was a great mixture of hip hop, old school, and other great classics
  The crowd was mixed which is perfect especially in the east bay and last but not least  the mixologist were definitely on point because the drinks are oh so tasty as well as  quiet a bit of a selection of drinks to choose from the menu
 They do accommodate seating for larger parties and their is no cover which is a major plus!!  I could see myself being a regular at this establishment! Keep up the good work Doug and staff thank you I'll be back very soon

 I cant think of the drink that the bartender made me it was something like Butterfly something, but that definitely should be put on the regular menu! DELICIOUS!!!! Try to order it next time you are there!
Bring Hiko a McRib and it'll be all good

great drinks, awesome atmosphere!
I just happen to be walking in the neighborhood doing some business with  a friend  and we just happened to stumbled upon this new whiskey bar
 I was told about it just days before, because some friends were going around showing pictures and talking about this new spot that was just about to open
 So, as we walk closer to the doors, just my luck it just happen to be open a
 Before entering my buddy and I were greeted by the main architect who crafted the gorgeous bar that sits insides, he told "yeah we're open go on inside", so go on inside is what we did
 I must say I was taken by surprise, it was a beautiful place
 I can tell a lot of work has gone into this place
 I remember what it used to be and it looks nothing like it
 It has somewhat of a new beginning a new birth
 We sat order a beer and quickly introduced to the owners
  They were super cool and the service was great
 We spoke about the selection of various whiskeys they had and we even sampled one, I must say it was pretty good
  They were also very supportive of other local business and were advocates of bringing local business to the bar
 To make a long story short, I wish The Night Light nothing but success and I see it becoming a staple in the newly renovated Downtown/Uptown/Jack London Oakland area  as a top place to go and visit
 Cheers!
Went on opening night and was impressed
  No frills, just good old cocktails and beer with a casual crowd
  Priced similar to other comparable Oak bars,  imagine drinks will be served quicker once the bartenders are up to speed
  I'll definitely be back!
Good drinks, good tunes, and good decor
 The owners are nice folks and so are the rest of the staff
 This is exactly the type of place I'd like to live next to and I'd love to see it stick around for a very long time
 Just add a foot rail at the bar and it's perfect

Way to go in the Big "O" !  So refreshing to see the lively crowd and the friendly faces
  From the Good natured Front door security, to the beautiful "bartend-ress", right on over to the DJ, spinning the vinyl, old school funk style
  The atmosphere is part bordello, part disco, and all fun
  They have spared no expense restoring this place and I loved every nuance from the beautiful Walnut wood bar,  the velvet and leather  embossed wall paper, the glitzy chandeliers, granite and tile in the uber clean bathrooms (it's a bar right?)
  By far and away the greatest addition to this neighborhood in many years
  Stop by and say hi to the owners Oakland Johhny and Dougie Doug, thanks to them we have a new excuse to hit the town again
  Can't wait to go back !
Had a fantastic time at the Night Light last night
 My drink, the Old Smokey, was an awesome scotch drink that lingered on my tastebuds into the next day (which was a good thing)! If you're a gin drinker, the MT
 Tamalpais gin is second to none! Great group of customers, and attitude-free bartenders
 The music was a fantastic mix of soul, hip-hop and obscure jazzy remixes
 5 big stars for the DJ as well! This is the Oakland bar scene I'm talking about
