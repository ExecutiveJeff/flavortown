BEGIN NOW This has slowly become my favorite bar near work, not because service is great, (there are often not enough bartenders for the crowd size, but they are always friendly), or because of the ambience (which is a mix of fun, eclectic, and the 90s version of hip), or because it is easy to get to when you are downtown, but because they found a way for me to enjoy grapefruit, one of my least favorite food items (it is just above jello, but below thousand year old duck eggs). END
BEGIN NOW  Their salty dogs and greyhounds are the best you can get. END
BEGIN NOW  I've debated with friends whether or not they adulterate the freshly squeezed grapefruit with some kind of addictive delicious drug. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm leaning toward not, but with how craveable they are, I'm not totally convinced. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe they inject the grapefruits before they squeeze them in front of you?Seriously, though. END
BEGIN NOW  If you've never been impressed with grapefruit mixed drinks, come here and order a salty dog. END
BEGIN NOW  Even if you are a beer drinker. END
BEGIN NOW (Old review reposted from 8/1/2015 to merge profiles)This weekend I came to visit from LA and my friends and I decided to catch up over a drink or two at van kleef. END
BEGIN NOW  I had never been there before but yesterday was definitely the last time. END
BEGIN NOW  The bouncer RAY was a nightmare. END
BEGIN NOW  He was rude as we walked in. END
BEGIN NOW  Then at around 130 he walks to the back yelling "everybody shut the fuck up and finish your drinks so you can leave!". END
BEGIN NOW  Now I can see if he had given 5 warnings ahead of time or something- but that was the first. END
BEGIN NOW  But either way, that's no way to talk to a paying customer. END
BEGIN NOW  The female bartender was rude as well but Ray definitely took the cake with his over zealous, power tripping behavior. END
BEGIN NOW  Screen the people you hire!!. END
BEGIN NOW I came here on a Friday night and I loved the happy, laid-back energy and the live jazz music here!The Greyhound is by far their most popular drink so that's what we got, and it tasted super refreshing (not necessarily what you'd associate with alcohol) because they add a lot of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice in there. END
BEGIN NOW The music really added to the ambiance and experience at this bar. END
BEGIN NOW  We were lucky enough to snag seats on the couches inside, under the stage. END
BEGIN NOW  Most people just chill and listen to the music, since there isn't enough room to dance. END
BEGIN NOW The entrance and hallway to the entrance is very narrow and squished though, and the floor there was super sticky because people kept spilling their drinks while squeezing past others. END
BEGIN NOW  However, the service is pretty good and they keep the tables and seats clean. END
BEGIN NOW Dark and cluttered and oh-so-entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW  What a delightful bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I think this goes without saying when you see the giant vice being used to squeeze all the grapefruits, but you must get a Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  I would have never called myself a greyhound fan in the past, but after trying theirs I now know why: FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice makes all the difference. END
BEGIN NOW It's all about the greyhound! Generous wedge of ruby red grapefruit served with it. END
BEGIN NOW  $1 off during happy hour brings it to $6. END
BEGIN NOW  Decor is eclectic and colorful. END
BEGIN NOW  Popular nights and shows require a cover. END
BEGIN NOW  Live music covers soul and jazz. END
BEGIN NOW  Only one restroom. END
BEGIN NOW  Plan accordingly! Not cash only. END
BEGIN NOW  Plentiful seating on weeknights. END
BEGIN NOW A must visit for anyone who goes out to the bars in Oakland and for the best greyhound anywhere. END
BEGIN NOW  Although my favorite part about here is the decor. END
BEGIN NOW  From stuffed big game and weird art, it has a new Orleans style jazz club decor (or at least what I'd imagine they look like) the walls and ceiling here never get boring to stare at. END
BEGIN NOW Great bar to relax and chit chat. END
BEGIN NOW  It reminds me of something you'd find in SF's mission, little small and a little tight but if you score one of the tables in the back you're set. END
BEGIN NOW  Not suggested for large groups but if you're the type to sometimes run out of things to say like on a date, it's a good place since you can always talk about the random oddities line the wall. END
BEGIN NOW  They play alternative rock, I didn't recognize any of the songs so only stayed long enough to have a few beers (ok tap) and try their signature greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  Vodka and freshly squeezed grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW  There's some pulp to it and it's probably the best greyhound I've had. END
BEGIN NOW  Worthy stop for a pub crawl to try their greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW I love Cafe Van Kleef! I have so many good memories here. END
BEGIN NOW  If I ever hear that one of my friends has never had a greyhound before, I take them here. END
BEGIN NOW   And whenever I order a greyhound at another establishment, I feel like I'm cheating on CVK. END
BEGIN NOW  Please forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW Of course the number one thing to order is the greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  They're made with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  Yum! I usually get mine with gin, but vodka is good as well. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't discriminate. END
BEGIN NOW  If you like salty things like me, get the salty dog! It's my personal fav and constantly crave it when I'm home. END
BEGIN NOW I love the look of this bar too. END
BEGIN NOW  It looks like an organized episode of Hoarders. END
BEGIN NOW  So many interesting things to look at! One con (or pro depending on the night) is it's so small. END
BEGIN NOW  It easily gets crowded. END
BEGIN NOW  They also have a cover charge on First Fridays, so I don't even bother. END
BEGIN NOW Peter VK must be rolling in his grave. END
BEGIN NOW  The Van Kleef of before is no longer. END
BEGIN NOW  Now filled with tech-bros, playing top 40 dance music, and no sign of a live band, or cool eccentric Oaklanders of before. END
BEGIN NOW  This used to be my favorite spot, but it changed seemingly overnight. END
BEGIN NOW  Not for me. END
BEGIN NOW Great spot for a variety of reasons: - Awesome greyhounds with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW must find out where they source their grapefruits because these are not your average ones. END
BEGIN NOW  They are SO delicious! The wedge they give you with the drink is amazing!- Cheap drinks- So eclecticThe not-so-greats:- There is only 1 bathroom in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW for both men and women. END
BEGIN NOW  This means there is always a line that is like 10 people long for the bathroom!!- The layout of the bar is really funky. END
BEGIN NOW  It definitely adds to the vibe, but it's hard to be here with a group unless you get one of the 4 tables. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, a must see when in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're looking for a cool spot to show out-of-towners, this is one of them!. END
BEGIN NOW Love this place! Awesome decorations and the overall ambience is great. END
BEGIN NOW  When you walk in, you're greeted by the smell of citrus, rather than stale beer! The bar is filled with large bowls of freshly cut grapefruit for their famous GREYHOUNDS! Usually not a big fan of the drink, but this bar makes them fresh and delicious and very strong! Must try!. END
BEGIN NOW Kitschy, quirky, and a total show stopper with the decor! I always find something new to look at - from the silly signs and the vintage memorabilia to the taxidermies critters. END
BEGIN NOW  Their hand-squeeze grapefruit grey hounds are delicious! I highly recommend this spot if you want to impress an out-of-towner. END
BEGIN NOW  They also give a discount if you are attending a show at the Fox Theater next door. END
BEGIN NOW This is a mandatory stop on any night out on Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW  Unless you don't like grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW  And who doesn't like fresh squeeze grapefruit based drinks? It's loud so if the bartender looks your way, just lift up the number of fingers correlating with the number you want (AND can carry through the crowded gauntlet that is the narrow passage to the back) without dropping the slice of grapefruit balanced on top. END
BEGIN NOW  Good luck. END
BEGIN NOW  It's worth it. END
BEGIN NOW  We usually get two or three minimum before moving on our two before a show at the Fox Theater. END
BEGIN NOW Like some people have said, the ambiance and drinks are great (although the Greyhound was overhyped), prices are fine, bartenders are fine, etc. END
BEGIN NOW  The security however is so bad I wonder how any of them are still employed. END
BEGIN NOW  We were given a ten minute warning before closing, and finished up our drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  However, unlike every other bar I've ever been to what the bouncer meant by "ten minutes" was not "finish your drinks and clear out" but "if you are not gone in ten minutes I will yell at you over and over like a deranged lunatic until you leave". END
BEGIN NOW This is not an exaggeration. END
BEGIN NOW  The time between him announcing they were closed and us having all our stuff packed to leave couldn't have been more than a minute. END
BEGIN NOW  It was so strange I didn't even realize he was talking to us until I looked up to wonder why he was yelling. END
BEGIN NOW We spent $60 and the crazy bastard wouldn't even let my friend use the bathroom before leaving. END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing wrong with this place in general, but I highly recommend to management that they check who was working the door on the evening of 3/23/2016 and fire them, because I can't imagine there are a lack of qualified applicants to the position who can are able to resist screaming at customers for no reason. END
BEGIN NOW Cluttered yes, weird things to look at yes (I am not talking about the people), drinks hell yesThey have several options to tickle your fancy, sampled a cold brew on tap, a greyhound and some sort of lemon shot. END
BEGIN NOW  There was no cover, place was crowded both at the bar and in the back, looking around it is allot to take in, there is a rabbit with horns, look for it before you get inebriated, again allot to take in wise for things to see at this bar, when bar crawling be sure to hit up this bar and check out the wall of alcohol mixed with oddities nailed or propped up on the wallsdrinks ****price no cover on thursday niteservice ****ambiance **** odd design but makes you keep flipping your head to take it all in. END
BEGIN NOW As everyone is sure to mention, the greyounds here will blow your brains! Cafe Van Kleef is known for them for a reason, what with their freshly squeezed, pulpy-sweet grapefruit juice and generous helping of vodka. END
BEGIN NOW  (If you want a salted rim, ask for a Salty Dog!) These things are dangerous and got me tipsy much quicker than I would've thought. END
BEGIN NOW  Be warned or indulge in the fact if you're taking a walk on the wild side for the night. END
BEGIN NOW What I wasn't expecting was how eclectic this deceivingly dingy looking dive bar would be, with their skeletons dressed as mariachi, samurai helmets, mirrors reflecting a reclining Jesus statue from the front, and Haunted Mansion-esque collection of chandeliers. END
BEGIN NOW  It truly is a one of a kind venue. END
BEGIN NOW  However, the place is kind of narrow and small, especially for the amount of people it serves at a time. END
BEGIN NOW Service at the bar was iffy as it was busy and the lack of eye contact from bartenders made getting their attention a pain. END
BEGIN NOW  But once the greyhound was in my hand it was all smooth sailing. END
BEGIN NOW SOME MISC TIPS:1) They have live music on a small stage at the back2) Only one unisex bathroom = massive lines for those breaking the seal, but props for it being well maintained3) Probably come here for the beginning of your night for a slow build up to getting sloshed as it's not well built for mingling/dance with little available seating 4) Really cool crowd of people, free of pretentious snobbery when you accidentally nudge them in that narrow bar space5) Tons of bars in this area to continue the party to if you're so inclined!. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get this out of the way: I'm sorry all other bars, Cafe Van Kleef has the best greyhounds of all time!There's a reason my friends call this place "that bar with the greyhounds". END
BEGIN NOW   Once you try one of these cocktails with freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice you'll forget there's anything else on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   For those of you not in the know a greyhound is basically just grapefruit juice and vodka,  But Cafe Van Kleef takes this a step further and uses only fresh squeezed grapefruit (with the pulp!!) that elevates this simple cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW   The pulp makes a huge difference because it helps mask the vodka (which they are superrrr generous with). END
BEGIN NOW   The bartender warned us that these creep up on you, and two glasses later he was not wrong!The bar itself is pretty indescribable, but I'm gonna go ahead and try to paint a mental picture. END
BEGIN NOW   It's basically packed floor to ceiling with the weirdest things: my favorites were a samurai helmet and a bust covered in lipstick marks. END
BEGIN NOW   The bar is narrow and at the end is a small stage that features live music. END
BEGIN NOW   We were lucky enough to go a night that was packed with 90's r&amp;b, there's no better background music for drinks in Oakland than Bobby Brown. END
BEGIN NOW My only complaint is that it was super packed. END
BEGIN NOW   To be fair it was a Friday night, but there was not much room and certainly no room to sit. END
BEGIN NOW   All that being said the service was super quick and friendly and the random people we bumped into were always nice, so there was only good vibes all around!So, if you're in Oakland and you need some tasty drinks and good music for a fun night, Cafe Van Kleef is a good start. END
BEGIN NOW   The best thing is it's smack dab in a hub of bars so it makes a great addition to a night of bar hopping. END
BEGIN NOW   And if you ever see me I'll take a greyhound as thanks for the suggestion! (4. END
BEGIN NOW 5/5). END
BEGIN NOW My favorite bar in Oakland, so far. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll count it down: 10. END
BEGIN NOW  A hop, skip and a hiccup away from BART. END
BEGIN NOW  Since parking is unbearable in the downtown streets of the O, this is kind of a big deal. END
BEGIN NOW  9. END
BEGIN NOW  The age of the crowd is pleasantly varied. END
BEGIN NOW  21-25? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW  35-40? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW  45-50. END
BEGIN NOW  Yep. END
BEGIN NOW  8. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd is NICE. END
BEGIN NOW  From the folks tending bar down to the folks in the bathroom line, there's no nastiness. END
BEGIN NOW  7. END
BEGIN NOW  No annoying tech sector. END
BEGIN NOW  6. END
BEGIN NOW  No one from wine. END
BEGIN NOW com. END
BEGIN NOW  5. END
BEGIN NOW  Plenty of places to sit-- all night. END
BEGIN NOW  No "Reserved" signs on any tables. END
BEGIN NOW  4. END
BEGIN NOW  The dee-jays mostly play that New Jack Swing y'all want to hear. END
BEGIN NOW  3. END
BEGIN NOW  The bathroom is shared by both sexes, but clean and the line moves fast. END
BEGIN NOW  2. END
BEGIN NOW  You don't have to yell to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you. END
BEGIN NOW  1. END
BEGIN NOW  Best greyhound in the bay, hands down! Believe the hype. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a drink you need to have!. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely the best greyhounds I have EVER had, and this is my favorite cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW  It's fresh and delicious, with a deceptively perfect combination of juice and vodka. END
BEGIN NOW  I upgraded to Ketel One and it was worth it. END
BEGIN NOW This is such a cool bar. END
BEGIN NOW  It's not very big, but long and narrow. END
BEGIN NOW  As you walk past the bar seating area, there are some tables and a stage at the very end. END
BEGIN NOW  I guess they have live music, which is great! They didn't have anything scheduled when I was there, but I was able to find a table to sit at and just talk to my friends. END
BEGIN NOW  I remember it being very crowded near the entrance/bar area, so I was surprised I managed to find a seat in the corner next to a creepy statue. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambience, very creepy decor with taxidermy animals and weird statues. END
BEGIN NOW  It's not bad though, I just was experiencing a severe case of the uncanny valley while sitting next to a statue bust talking to my friend. END
BEGIN NOW  I had to literally turn the thing away from my because I felt like it was staring at me. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar is in a cool area where you can go bar hopping, and when things close you can step outside for some falafel. END
BEGIN NOW  Night made. END
BEGIN NOW  I recommend this place to people who enjoy quirky and creepy ambience and live music!. END
BEGIN NOW I love greyhounds and theirs are pretty much as good as it gets. END
BEGIN NOW  That's all the reason I need to go back. END
BEGIN NOW Get your week's worth of vitamin C. END
BEGIN NOW I was sad the last time I went to find they'd taken a lot of the bric-a-brac down off the walls, but I trust it was only to make room for new and different bric-a-brac. END
BEGIN NOW   (I like to imagine there's a huge unmarked warehouse somewhere in Oakland, looking like the last scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark, whence Van Kleef's artifacts originate and whither they return. END
BEGIN NOW ). END
BEGIN NOW Oh my. END
BEGIN NOW  Try the Salty Dog and you'll be coming back for more. END
BEGIN NOW  Great place if you want to exchange body fluids with strangers. END
BEGIN NOW  Lots of fun. END
BEGIN NOW 5 million starts for the truly outstanding fresh squeezed delicious perfect Greyhounds with giant grapefruit wedges. END
BEGIN NOW  2 stars for tiny tiny facility, but just cause I'm grumpy like that. END
BEGIN NOW  Seriously unmissable for the citrus cocktail set. END
BEGIN NOW  . END
BEGIN NOW maybe don't bother going if you don't like Greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW  :D. END
BEGIN NOW I personally don't care for this place too much. END
BEGIN NOW I don't hate it though! it's such such a visually stimulating place that I always finding new things to look at inside. END
BEGIN NOW  The greyhounds made here are supposed to be fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW but i don't like grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  But all my friends love them! But I love bringing out of towners here to experience the ambiance and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Came here last night after a great show at the Fox. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a group of four of us - me and three friends from out of town. END
BEGIN NOW  I was excited to share the Van Kleef grayhound deliciousness with them. END
BEGIN NOW We walked up to the bouncer just as another, larger group came from the opposite direction. END
BEGIN NOW  The bouncer told me that there was a second bouncer that could check our IDs closer to the door, on the patio, so that he could check the other group's. END
BEGIN NOW Just then, this second bouncer came out to the front. END
BEGIN NOW  We were standing there with our IDs out for him. END
BEGIN NOW  He walked up and shook his head and said, "Only 2 more people can come in. END
BEGIN NOW  We're at capacity. END
BEGIN NOW "I look at my friends and look back at him. END
BEGIN NOW  "We have four people. END
BEGIN NOW  Can some of us hang on the patio?" (There was plenty of space on the patio) He responds and tells us, that the other group getting their IDs checked is coming in and that we can't (there was 6 in the other group). END
BEGIN NOW  Then, he says, that they showed up first. END
BEGIN NOW I politely tell him that we showed up first, at which he point he gets in my face and yells, "My man in front decides who matters and doesn't matter. END
BEGIN NOW  You can't come in! You don't matter!"Wow. END
BEGIN NOW Embarrassed, I took my friends to Dogwood where we enjoyed the rest of the night. END
BEGIN NOW  I won't be back to Cafe Von Kleef. END
BEGIN NOW I really like Cafe Van Kleef! It's one on my favorite places to kick the night off in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  It's right by the BART and the crowd is eclectic and super chill. END
BEGIN NOW  Like everyone else is saying, the quirky decorations make the ambience super interesting. END
BEGIN NOW  I discover something new on the walls each time I'm there. END
BEGIN NOW  Make sure you get their greyhound! (vodka + fresh grapefruit juice) They serve it with a huge piece of grapefruit, so as far as cocktails go, this one is pretty healthy. END
BEGIN NOW  (Right? Right??) Two cons: - There's only one bathroom for the entire place. END
BEGIN NOW  So on a weekend night, prepare to wait in line for at least 10 - 15 minutes to get your turn to pee. END
BEGIN NOW  (Not cool man, there's only so much alcohol a bladder can handle. END
BEGIN NOW )- They allow people to smoke right outside the front door, so you have to walk through a cloud of cigarette smoke to enter and exit the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Sometime you can even smell it when you are at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Not a fan of that!. END
BEGIN NOW Greyhounds are sweet (albeit nervous) little pups. END
BEGIN NOW  Cafe Van Kleef does not serve up the canines, but the tasty cocktail version, complete with freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  These lovelies are potent, yet highly drinkable. END
BEGIN NOW  I had had a bad experience with gin, but my friend is an avid gin-guzzler, so I joined him in downing several greyhounds and a couple of gin and tonics each. END
BEGIN NOW  Pretty ambitious for a Tuesday night, but I did manage to catch BART back home by midnight. END
BEGIN NOW  The decor inside is eclectic, kind of yard sale chic, with lots of strange knick knacks to stare at and admire. END
BEGIN NOW  It's dark inside, but not eerily so. END
BEGIN NOW  Very relaxing vibes. END
BEGIN NOW  I felt safe and comfortable, although very hot from all of the alcohol I was chugging. END
BEGIN NOW  Some genuinely sweet strangers sat down at our table and joined us: I can only remember a girl named Luigi and her boyfriend, Nathan. END
BEGIN NOW  Awesome drinking buddies, good conversationalists. END
BEGIN NOW  The staff were all kindly gentleman and drinks were served with a smile. END
BEGIN NOW  I really, really dig this place, and will be returning many, many times. END
BEGIN NOW  But okay, no more boozing for the rest of the week (even though I'm sure I got at least a hint of Vitamin C out of all that citrus). END
BEGIN NOW How have I never been here before? I'll be honest, I had heard the name but never really known where Cafe Van Kleef was located. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking was relatively easy on a Monday evening and there were lots of seats available. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend told me they get pretty packed on the weekends and that made sense. END
BEGIN NOW  I was feeling kind of sick so I ordered a hot toddy and a few greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW  When you walk into this place you feel like you've entered a scene from Indiana Jones. END
BEGIN NOW  There are "decorations" everywhere with what I can only describe as a worldly theme. END
BEGIN NOW  African Rhinos, samurai helmets, Eiffel towers, you name it and it's on the wall or tucked into some corner. END
BEGIN NOW  The greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW  That all anybody talks about when it comes to this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Theyre good. END
BEGIN NOW  Really good. END
BEGIN NOW  They have pitchers of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice on the counters that they use to make their drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  They also rest a quarter of a grapefruit on your glass. END
BEGIN NOW  To squeeze or not to squeeze, that is the question. END
BEGIN NOW  Pro tip, drink a little of your drink before you squeeze the grapefruit into your drink and plunk that thing in there. END
BEGIN NOW  Overflow alert! Since I'm a noobie I spilled way too much of my drink on the table. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm a big fan. END
BEGIN NOW Only drawback for me is that there is a smoking area right out front and the smoke filters into the bar and for an ex smoker like me, it is a little much. END
BEGIN NOW  Also the fruit flies are annoying. END
BEGIN NOW  But I'm definitely coming back! Cool spot, cool drinks, cool vibe. END
BEGIN NOW RIP Peter the legend. END
BEGIN NOW  GREYHOUNDS FOR ALL! One of the best bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Ambience, bartenders, crowd. END
BEGIN NOW  Only negative is that there is literally one bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW Lovingly called Cafe Van Queef by its most loyal patrons, this establishment has eclectic tastes and a mean Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  Although rather intimidating by the looks of them, the guy guarding its gates are sweet as can be. END
BEGIN NOW  Greyhounds come with a side of fresh grapefruit as "garnish". END
BEGIN NOW  Most weekends and some weekdays there's live music on their small stage. END
BEGIN NOW  The music I've found is usually hit or miss but you're bound to have a great time either way. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a smoking area as well just outside the bar as well. END
BEGIN NOW A legendary Uptown Oakland Establishment. END
BEGIN NOW  I've known about it for as long as it's been around. END
BEGIN NOW  But only ever ventured in recently. END
BEGIN NOW  I love the funky, friendly, welcoming atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  The cool mix of all people. END
BEGIN NOW  The staff who work there are amazingly low-key and don't have the "hipper than you" attitude i've been feeling around Oakland joints lately. END
BEGIN NOW  Places like this are beginning to fade away in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  I hope with the owner's passing, this precious jewel in the Oakland bar scene doesn't fade away any time too soon. END
BEGIN NOW  VIVA LA CAFE VAN KLEEF!. END
BEGIN NOW What I love about Van Kleef's is how it is so inconspicuous from the outside. END
BEGIN NOW  The facade is very simple and the entrance is small. END
BEGIN NOW  You wouldn't expect it to be the size that it is on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW I've thrown a few small get-togethers here with friends and have had a really good time. END
BEGIN NOW  The interior decor is definitely a conversation starter and the selection of drinks is impressive. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is known for their greyhounds (grapefruit, vodka cocktail) so make sure you order one if you want to get the full experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Most of my friends that come here for drinks are locals or burners (Burning Man ppl). END
BEGIN NOW  It's generally a friendly crowd and I people usually end up talking to eachother at the bar even if they didn't arrive together. END
BEGIN NOW I feel bad giving this place a 3 star review. END
BEGIN NOW  It deserves a 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5. END
BEGIN NOW  Yet a part of me can't do it. END
BEGIN NOW  Its not because the drinks or decor sucks. END
BEGIN NOW  Its the fact that everything is freaking sticky and you can't move. END
BEGIN NOW  If it was bigger I would actually have a better time, but instead I'm at the bar and letting people rub up on me to get around me. END
BEGIN NOW  You take what you get and thats what you get at this place. END
BEGIN NOW  That greyhound thou lol. END
BEGIN NOW Terrible yuppie bar with mediocre drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  Come here if you wanna chill with "bros" and "techies" who have no social skills. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a regular here but its down the street from my usual bars and they do have really good greyhounds/salty dogs - freshly squeezed grapefruits!!!  ( they do not strain the pulp so be warned! ) I called my alcohol but the bartender still used vodka out of some nondescript glass bottle. END
BEGIN NOW   ugh. END
BEGIN NOW   Still $7 wasn't bad. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll skip describing the decor since many here already have. END
BEGIN NOW  I like it here but i am not a fan of second hand smoke so I normally pass on this place too bad though because its funkiness is right up my alley. END
BEGIN NOW  They do charge usually on weekends but i tend to go when its not packed (early). END
BEGIN NOW  If you are visiting Oakland this place is a MUST. END
BEGIN NOW It's small and narrow with a stage inside where there was a live band. END
BEGIN NOW  I liked the heads, swords, and satanic decorations. END
BEGIN NOW  I was told they are known for their greyhound drink (grapefruit and vodka) where the grapefruit is freshly squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW  I happened to get a bartender that made my greyhound really strong and I was served right away. END
BEGIN NOW  You can tell it was gwtting prtty busy and they stopped putting a garnish on the cups, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, I'd come here again to start the night. END
BEGIN NOW  A lot of interesting people. END
BEGIN NOW This bar is awesome . END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious Greyhound with freshly squeezed grapefruit  and HUGE slice of garnishing . END
BEGIN NOW  . END
BEGIN NOW  Must try . END
BEGIN NOW Greyhounds are amazing! Taste Good and Get the Job Done. END
BEGIN NOW Alot of crazy things around you so as you get drunker, the crazier they seem. END
BEGIN NOW Nice small, chill spot. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely coming back. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but Yuppies &amp; Techies in this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Sad because it's a cool looking spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure why everyone is so impressed by the Grey Hounds  (just vodka &amp; grapefruit juice) when Oakland has so many craft cocktail &amp; beer options. END
BEGIN NOW This spot is a little hidden, I've gone to Dogwood how many times and never noticed this spot?!It's a great after work spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here on a Thursday night &amp; tried the Greyhound (grapefruit &amp; gin cocktail. END
BEGIN NOW )  It was refreshingly ok, but then I'm a bourbon guy so I'm partial. END
BEGIN NOW Not sure how to describe the theme, it's virtually a lot of random decor (like 1950s phone and other random cool pieces. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun place, hopefully the next time I come there will be a band playing on the stage!. END
BEGIN NOW Fun place so many things to "try" to look and focus on while drinking and buzzed! It's a fun challenge! Came and saw everyone ordering their greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  I guess that's what they're known for. END
BEGIN NOW  "Excellent". END
BEGIN NOW OMG. END
BEGIN NOW  Come here all the time but tonight I was swept off my feet by the crew and the vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  This is my Thursday ritual and will continue to be until I get priced out. END
BEGIN NOW  Connie is my homegirl. END
BEGIN NOW  Come check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW Greyhounds are amazing, fresh squeezed in front of you. END
BEGIN NOW  Good for friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Comfortable bar with character. END
BEGIN NOW Cafe Van Kleef is one of the coolest bars in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   I only wish I had known about it sooner. END
BEGIN NOW   They specialize in Greyhounds with a huge wedge of grapefruit on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   It's just one of those places that excites your senses because there is so much going on - on the walls, at the bar, and all around. END
BEGIN NOW   Highly recommend checking it out if you are in the area. END
BEGIN NOW This place is pretty dope since I enjoy a spot that places new wave tracks. END
BEGIN NOW  The service is super friendly, which is a plus and they have a great happy hour special. END
BEGIN NOW  This will definitely be a new favorite kick it spot!. END
BEGIN NOW It's all been said. END
BEGIN NOW  best greyhounds in the world. END
BEGIN NOW If I could I would give 0 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Stepped 1 foot outside the bar with a beer in hand and was chased out of the bar with no warning. END
BEGIN NOW   Had to sign for my credit card at the entrance. END
BEGIN NOW   I understand and respect the no drinking outside of the space but a warning would have sufficed. END
BEGIN NOW   Needed to leave friends inside. END
BEGIN NOW Only live music venue that has great jazz and blues! Like the Dave Rocha band!Well priced drinks!. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone likes this place. END
BEGIN NOW  It was OK, but it's not really my scene. END
BEGIN NOW Best bar in Oakland !!! Grey hounds are the best hands down and the beautiful bartender that works monday Tuesday and Thursday's big shout out to my Jesse Ray Jim Bob Roy Lee!!! He is the best!!!. END
BEGIN NOW I could spend all my time at CVK. END
BEGIN NOW  Like, if I was a trust fund kid, I'd be their regular drunk. END
BEGIN NOW  Just hanging off the bar clutching a greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  All day, every day. END
BEGIN NOW $7 will bring you to greyhound heaven. END
BEGIN NOW  Even if you don't like greyhounds, you need to order them here. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm telling you like a boss bitch. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a dark bar that looks like an antique store inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Pick out your favorite creepy antique or taxidermy. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like drunk iSpy. END
BEGIN NOW  They have shows, the smoking area out front is a fun place to chill, and if you're going to a show at the Fox, you're stopping here (boss bitch again). END
BEGIN NOW *They take cards and have a $10 CC min. END
BEGIN NOW Full of crazy decorations and 80's Music. END
BEGIN NOW  Not really my scene but I have friends that would love this spot. END
BEGIN NOW  The Greyhound here is a grapefruit lover's dream. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a big fan of grapefruit but it was still pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Just keep the greyhounds coming then I wouldn't mind staying at this bar. END
BEGIN NOW Epic place!  I have been going here since I moved to Oakland a few years ago. END
BEGIN NOW   As you can probably guess, the Greyhounds are fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW   To be clear, I dislike grapefruit in any other form, but when they get the Ruby Reds in. END
BEGIN NOW it is on!  Bartenders and patrons are friendly and welcoming and Sculpin on tap. END
BEGIN NOW   I could do without smoking (cigarrettes) at the entrance/patio, but I am happy to muddle through that given what is inside. END
BEGIN NOW We walked in. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never walked into a room and said "man, this place smells like grapefruits" but I turned to my friend and said "man this place smells like grapefruits!" I told him the place was famous for their greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW  He ordered one for me and a beer for himself. END
BEGIN NOW  I looked around the room. END
BEGIN NOW  Every single person there had a greyhound; short red straw, giant quarter of a grapefruit garnish. END
BEGIN NOW  "Are you sure you want a beer?" He promptly changed it to a greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW Months later, we're regulars. END
BEGIN NOW  I think they think were married because we don't talk to each other much and play I Spy with the trinkets that litter the wall behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW The bathroom always seems to have a line, but only right when it's your time to go. END
BEGIN NOW  Why did someone write "please knock first" on the door or the bathroom? I'll never know, but I'm sorry. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not pooping. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm taking bathroom selfies. END
BEGIN NOW Ok so the Greyhounds here are fantastical and at $7 it's the best you're going to get. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is very interesting and dive barry and there are some truly attention piquing antique pieces. END
BEGIN NOW  While I was initially put off by the strong beedi smell and tempted to break in to a dance to this song: youtube. END
BEGIN NOW com/watch?v=XLJC… I decided to enjoy my drink with my colleagues in piece and peace. END
BEGIN NOW  That is my update. END
BEGIN NOW One word: GREYHOUNDWhen ever I see a juicer attached to the bar, say that in my head. END
BEGIN NOW  Most refreshing drink ever! The bartenders are always so nice and fun to talk to! Not to mention: it's a great place to play 'I spy' in! Trust me on this. END
BEGIN NOW  My boyfriend and I play it every time we come here. END
BEGIN NOW  It's hilarious. END
BEGIN NOW  Even with the bartenders!Minus the bathroom situation. END
BEGIN NOW  Other than that, this is a place you must go too!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW Small, but good for intimate/small groups. END
BEGIN NOW  Grapefruit beer is the BEST!. END
BEGIN NOW This place gets most of its stars for the decor, which is crazy and supposed to be surreal, I think. END
BEGIN NOW   I came on Halloween, and you know, even if it wasn't Halloween, you'd still think it was Halloween in there. END
BEGIN NOW   There are skulls, rhinos, swordfish, psychedelic-ness, all sorts of crazy shit plastered all over the walls. END
BEGIN NOW   I love the feast for the eyes, the visual smorgasbord of animals and art!  As for the Greyhounds, which everyone's been raving about, they're alright. END
BEGIN NOW   I did like that they're generous with the pours and there's a healthy amount of fresh grapefruit juice in there. END
BEGIN NOW   You should definitely come here just to hang out in a cool space - fun and wacky art, pretty chill space and crowd, and okay Greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW I love this place for their Greyhounds! I came a few years back and thought it was a fluke and after I tried another place up the street that didn't even compare, I decided to comeback here after a long day with some coworkers. END
BEGIN NOW  They are VERY generous with the vodka and the grapefruit juice is fresh squeezed and to die for! And to top it off, you get a large slice of delicious grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd definitely recommend coming for the Greyhound, probably a good first stop for an evening in downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW Live band + hipster townies + freshly-fresh-fresh squeezed grapefruit juice in your greyhounds made to order = awesome night. END
BEGIN NOW  But hold your horses cowboys and girls, there's only 1 bathroom for this whole dive bar so drink responsibly!. END
BEGIN NOW arrived here late on a friday night and it was hopping! great bar, with plenty of drinkers and just good vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  one of the better bars around the area, and there are many choices. END
BEGIN NOW the drinks were stiff. END
BEGIN NOW  what more do you need!. END
BEGIN NOW Really cool bar in downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Right around the corner from 19th st bart so convenient. END
BEGIN NOW  The whole place has a sort thrift store feel too it which makes it feel kind of homey and comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're lucky enough to go by on a night they have live music all the better! Saturday night there was a great local jazz group playing. END
BEGIN NOW They're known for their Greyhounds (grapefruit vodka drinks) but I would recommend the Salty Dog. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a Greyhound with a salted rim and the salt compliments the grapefruit beautifully. END
BEGIN NOW  Only downside is they charge cover on First Fridays (like many bars in the area). END
BEGIN NOW Don't miss Brass Magic at Van Kleef along with the salty dogs. END
BEGIN NOW What can I say about Cafe Van Kleef that hasn't been said before by countless others? This place is OFF THE HOOK! For someone who doesn't go to bars in Uptown Oakland, *this* place in particular opened the door and introduced me to my city on the come-up: seriously, if you haven't made it to this spot, get off your ass and do so!First thing's first: the place is small, narrow (from the front entrance to the stage, located at the back) and jam-packed to the hilt with people. END
BEGIN NOW but people don't generally seem to mind if you're trying to squeeze in between to find a place to sit. END
BEGIN NOW which you probably won't. END
BEGIN NOW  It gets hot quick, so do yourself and don't wear more than two-three layers of clothing like I did. END
BEGIN NOW The night I went was for my 25th, there was a LIVE New Orleans-style marching band which did a cover of Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'" - how friggin' marvelous that was, with everyone vibin' and groovin' on the dance floor, which added to the feel of an alcohol-induced fever dream in a darkly-lit bordello. END
BEGIN NOW  The band which performed that night was *phenomenal*, I just wish I had stayed sober enough to remember their name. END
BEGIN NOW  sensory overload in the best possible way - seriously, from the floor to the ceiling, it's expansive and all kinds of odds and ends/knick-knacks to stare at in ogle at: WOW. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks are reasonably price, but I wouldn't know really since I stuck to Greyhounds all night and they were all free; if Greyhounds are not your specialty, they will be after your experience here: served quickly by the speedy staff behind the bar, and topped with a thick-as-hell grapefruit slice, you'll be making between 5 to 6 trips from your seat or to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all, if you're out on a Thursday night (or any night for that matter) and need a spot to kick it and shoot the breeze with a couple of friends, go to Cafe Van Kleef's!. END
BEGIN NOW I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Their greyhounds are amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't go out often, but this is definitely my go-to spot. END
BEGIN NOW This place is my go-to when I want a drink in downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  They're known for their greyhounds, which are made with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  Even if you don't like greyhounds, you should try one if you come here. END
BEGIN NOW  Not doing so would be like going to San Francisco and never trying the sourdough bread or going to New Orleans and never having a beignet. END
BEGIN NOW  What I tend to do, however, is I order a double greyhound (in a tall glass) so I don't have to keep returning to the bar, which can get crowded at times. END
BEGIN NOW   This bar is divey, with a diverse crowd, and lots of random things decorating the walls. END
BEGIN NOW  Just how I like a bar to be!. END
BEGIN NOW Cue spaghetti western music with some slap bass. END
BEGIN NOW  Is it wrong that I hear a mash-up of Ennio Morricone and Les Claypool in my head every time I venture into this bar? I think it's safe to say that everyone in Oakland knows about Cafe Van Kleef and it's legendary Greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW  The walls of this joint are covered with ephemera from unknown origins. END
BEGIN NOW  The atmosphere is part episode of Hoarders, and part antique shop. END
BEGIN NOW  Van Kleef is typically packed to the gills, stacked three or four deep from the bar, which is saying a lot since the "bar" is deeper on the employee side than the customer side. END
BEGIN NOW  Service here is hit-and-miss. END
BEGIN NOW  Meaning you'll probably be ignored for a minute or ten since it is so damn busy, but once the barkeep gets to you, they will be fairly attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  Bar space, Hell standing space, is at a premium. END
BEGIN NOW  We were able to rustle up prime bar seating near the entrance, however I quickly realized why that space was soooo readily available after inhaling an entire pack of second hand Marlboros and Virginia Slims. END
BEGIN NOW  On to the Greyhounds, booze-wise, they are rather weak. END
BEGIN NOW  I noticed the bartender was pouring vodka out of an anonymous bottle. END
BEGIN NOW  Probably some terrible generic well-vodka ,Russian named swill à la Popov. END
BEGIN NOW  All complaints aside though, it's a fantastic tasting drink. END
BEGIN NOW  The fresh squeezed ruby grapefruit juice and quartered citrus on top elevate this otherwise weak sauce into something special. END
BEGIN NOW  I guess if you want bang for your buck, order spirits, neat. END
BEGIN NOW  If you want to enjoy a tasty libation with friends, Greyhound my man. END
BEGIN NOW  Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW Dear god, the greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW The bartender poured a terrifying amount of vodka into the glass with a light splash of fresh grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  The drink, however, was surprisingly light (and weak), and I loved the extra slice of grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW  Vitamin C!! Probably the best greyhound I've had in the bay area. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd is super diverse, although most people seemed like locals. END
BEGIN NOW There is no food to be ordered at Cafe Van Kleef despite the confusion of it being called a cafe. END
BEGIN NOW   I know because they would not allow my family to enter because our 6 month old baby was not of drinking age. END
BEGIN NOW I stopped at  Cafe Van Kleef after a concert at the Fox Theater. END
BEGIN NOW  The bouncer would not let me in because my California drivers license expired a few days before. END
BEGIN NOW  Mind you, I am 56 years old and look every bit my age. END
BEGIN NOW  I have been a customer for 10 years. END
BEGIN NOW  The bouncer was very rude and condescending to me. END
BEGIN NOW  I noticed the place has gone downhill in the past few years. END
BEGIN NOW Greyhounds are AMAZING!. END
BEGIN NOW Great atmosphere complimented by good people and tasty drinks . END
BEGIN NOW  Can't wait to return :). END
BEGIN NOW My date suggested we pop over to Cafe Van Kleef, after having snacks and cocktails at Dogwood. END
BEGIN NOW  I had no idea what to expect of the place and, honestly, I'd driven by a bunch of times and had not even noticed it there. END
BEGIN NOW What a cute and awesome little bar! We went on a Monday night, so it wasn't overly crowded and it was kind of on the mellow side. END
BEGIN NOW  Very nice, my kind of vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Since I was told the fresh-squeezed Greyhound was the house specialty, I ordered one and it didn't disappoint! I like Greyhounds anyway, but the fresh juice made it so much more yummy. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartender told us the grapefruits' flavor changes with the season; we got lucky and ours were plenty sweet to balance out the tart. END
BEGIN NOW The inside of the bar is randomly, kitsch-ily decorated and is very entertaining to try to look at everything. END
BEGIN NOW  Both the bartender and the doorman were friendly and provided good service. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all, a nice little bar that I'd be quite happy to return to. END
BEGIN NOW Oh what a night! Two greyhounds at the bar with Peter, by Markus N. END
BEGIN NOW , or . END
BEGIN NOW  Travels Through the Looking Glass. END
BEGIN NOW  You decide. END
BEGIN NOW  For me it could be either, and I may as well have followed a hurrying hasenpfeffer inside, that's how down-the-rabbit-hole Van Kleef's is. END
BEGIN NOW  One evening there moons back I went joke for joke with a funny fellow I haven't seen since. END
BEGIN NOW  I was in my prime; we told for over an hour. END
BEGIN NOW  Last night with M from Marcellos I found the questioning glance of the lady to my left owed to her looking for college alum. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems she was the organizer of a reunion and . END
BEGIN NOW  no one had come. END
BEGIN NOW  Sad in a way, until she started laying out her reasoning as to why ladies should never date professional ballplayers. END
BEGIN NOW  Then quite captivating. END
BEGIN NOW  Random, and rewarding. END
BEGIN NOW  At Van Kleef's the specialty is (as you all know already) the freshly squeezed Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  Peter has apparently also invented the Vanhattan and Lord knows what else, but I stick with what will keep the scurvy at bay. END
BEGIN NOW  Many nights acts fill the small stage to the rear, and the memorabilia of a man's life line the walls. END
BEGIN NOW  And the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW  And pretty much every nook and cranny not occupied by the hip Oaktown uptown scene. END
BEGIN NOW  Which so beats Chestnut Street, imho. END
BEGIN NOW  Not that it's relevant here but I'm just going to say it anyway - with the glow of the Greyhound in my belly and brain I ventured to SF for the icing. END
BEGIN NOW  A little brisket with two of Yelp's finest. END
BEGIN NOW  That's all. END
BEGIN NOW  What a lady (a couple of ladies), what a night. END
BEGIN NOW Great location and I love that they have a smoking section in front. END
BEGIN NOW  Known for their greyhounds and understandably so. END
BEGIN NOW  They are very fresh and the service is fast and upbeat. END
BEGIN NOW  It's just a really relaxing place to hang out and there's a good crowd in the evenings. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is kinda like Cheers for me; everyone knows my name. END
BEGIN NOW Best drinks/bartenders in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Great greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW  Come in Thursday nights, bartenders  and music on point. END
BEGIN NOW This is my new default watering hole. END
BEGIN NOW  Awesome, friendly staff. END
BEGIN NOW  Good beer. END
BEGIN NOW  Really fun decor. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a great crew of regulars as well. END
BEGIN NOW I really love this place. END
BEGIN NOW the eclectic decorations, the narrow entrance and the locals feel. END
BEGIN NOW   BUT. END
BEGIN NOW if you are not a smoker you are going to need to head to the very back and even then I am not sure you will escape the smoke. END
BEGIN NOW   The front of the place is set back about 8 feet so that there is a smokers patio, and the smoke just blasts in the front door rather than out. END
BEGIN NOW   A small fresh air intake fan in the back would probably create just enough positive air pressure to keep the smoke from being sucked inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Until that happens, I'm going to steer clear. END
BEGIN NOW   What a bummer. END
BEGIN NOW Amazing live music, a great atmosphere, and fresh grapefruit cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   My first time in Cafe van Kleef certainly left an impression. END
BEGIN NOW  The brass New Orleans style jazz band playing that evening was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  The greyhound cocktails made with fresh grapefruit were great. END
BEGIN NOW  The decor is eclectic, yet cool with all kinds of different objects covering the walls. END
BEGIN NOW  The only downside is that it can get quite loud and noisy, so you might have to go somewhere else to have a deep conversation. END
BEGIN NOW  And another huge plus: incredibly friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW  Bouncers and bartenders in Oakland are (based on my experiences so far) much friendlier, than their San Francisco counterparts. END
BEGIN NOW  I always feel welcome, and they are always polite and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland is becoming my favorite 'let's go out for a drink' city by a wide margin. END
BEGIN NOW Ok so someone dragged me in here! Really wasn't in the mood to drink so I ordered water and my friend ordered a greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  Once the drink came I tried their greyhound and let's just say before the night was over I drank 4 greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW so much for not being in the mood! The greyhounds were so good honestly you can't even taste the alcohol and I watched Danny the bartender pour the drink and yes this drink had a good amount of alcohol to it! When  I return to Oakland this will definitely be on my go to bar list!. END
BEGIN NOW "Thank you Sir, May I have another. END
BEGIN NOW " - Kevin BaconThat is all I could think of when I downed my first Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  (Funny thing is, I later went home and watched Animal House) Greyhounds are a thing of pure genius concocted by the wonderful chemists at Van Kleef. END
BEGIN NOW  Four simple ingredients: Ice, Vodka, Grapefruit juice, Grapefruit wedge. END
BEGIN NOW  Simple and beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW I dare you to only have one. END
BEGIN NOW  I double dare you. END
BEGIN NOW  These reasonably priced super cocktails are too damn good to just have one. END
BEGIN NOW  I promise you, these things are addictive. END
BEGIN NOW  (I'm gettin' the itch)I like the way this place feels. END
BEGIN NOW  Dusty junk all over the place, it just wreaks of awesomeness. END
BEGIN NOW  You'll love art, the taxidermy, and bric-a-brac that adorns every square inch of Van Kleef. END
BEGIN NOW Free popcorn anybody?. END
BEGIN NOW This is my favorite bar in the east bay, super chill styles. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the kinda place you wanna spend all night in  while enjoying the best greyhounds  in the world. END
BEGIN NOW  Conny and Aaron are the best. END
BEGIN NOW  I get service as soon as I step 2 the bar by the some of the most fun bartenders in the east bay. END
BEGIN NOW   Real reconize real :). END
BEGIN NOW hands down best alcholic beverage i have ever had! fresh squeezed grapefruit and vodka, and i don't even like grapefruits!!!!!!!! go figure, do yourself a favor and stop by here for a drink! do it! now! go!!. END
BEGIN NOW The Salty Dog is my new favorite drink. END
BEGIN NOW  It's 7 bucks and amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  Order it. END
BEGIN NOW  Now. END
BEGIN NOW  Van Kleef's is like someone took the decorations from a creepy old gothic spinster aunt's stuffy Victorian flat and hung them up all over. END
BEGIN NOW  It's pretty visually amazing, eclectic, strange. END
BEGIN NOW if you're a straight shooter or an MTV type of kid, this ain't your scene. END
BEGIN NOW  Good music on the jukebox, nice cozy spot for a date. END
BEGIN NOW  Bartenders are quick, courteous. END
BEGIN NOW  Not a pretentious scene, come as you are. END
BEGIN NOW  Best chill place in Uptown. END
BEGIN NOW Let your nose get a treat from the smell of freshly squeezed grapefruit! That was my favorite part about this place. END
BEGIN NOW  they're serious about their Greyhounds and they come with a giant wedge of the fruit on top. END
BEGIN NOW  Is it the professional citrus-squeezer-thing that makes the drink taste like pink sunshine? I'm not sure, but next time I'm getting only the juice. END
BEGIN NOW  The vodka's just getting in the way. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes, I'm turning into a sober old lady. END
BEGIN NOW  Gimme my juice!Your eyes also get something like a treat. END
BEGIN NOW  It's eclectic in there. END
BEGIN NOW  You don't know what to expect. END
BEGIN NOW  Good times. END
BEGIN NOW And of course the ears - what my arm candy and I really came for was the music. END
BEGIN NOW  A great middle-age jazz band with some real expertise set the mood so that it was exciting yet relaxed at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW  Very well worth the $5 cover, especially since we showed up early and got a table. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a great place to try on a weekend night!. END
BEGIN NOW My second time visiting this little gem!Fantastic Jazz band, delicious greyhound and PACKED PACKED PACKED. END
BEGIN NOW  What a wonderful little spot!All this for a $5. END
BEGIN NOW 00 cover. END
BEGIN NOW amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  Do yourself a favor and stop in. END
BEGIN NOW Let's pretend that my New Year's resolution was to avoid going into San Francisco for wild, music &amp; booze filled weekends, and instead, to find some epic spots in the East Bay that could get the job done with just as much debaucherous pizzazz. END
BEGIN NOW  Enter Cafe Van Kleef. END
BEGIN NOW  Resolution kept. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is almost indescribable, but I'll try. END
BEGIN NOW  It is cluttered from floor to ceiling, like an antique store that's never sold a thing. END
BEGIN NOW  There is taxidermy decor, twinkle lights, and carafes of pulpy grapefruit + vodka. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a small stage towards the back where you can gaze up, glazey-eyed, at whatever unexpectedly cool band is jamming. END
BEGIN NOW  People dance, people sit, some are kooky and all are content. END
BEGIN NOW After visit #1, I'm pretty in love with this place. END
BEGIN NOW  $10 cover may seem steep for Oak-town, but there's nowhere quite like Van Kleef (and if there is, please do tell!). END
BEGIN NOW Last night, my bf and I brought a friend in town to experience the quirkiness of Van Kleef. END
BEGIN NOW   While the greyhounds were still great and the doorman was super nice, the rest of the service was awful. END
BEGIN NOW  Our fave bartender (super sweet lady) was not there and the one bartender that was there was clearly overwhelmed, was giving free drinks to her friends, and took no ownership of the other drunk patrons in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   When our round of greyhounds came up, the bartender pushed them towards us roughly, one of the pieces of grapefruit fell onto a drunk girls lap who then had the audacity to place it back INTO our drink. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartender saw this and did nothing. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf had to ask for a fresh drink and the bartender was RUDE back to him. END
BEGIN NOW  Awful experience. END
BEGIN NOW My favorite bar in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Unique space, friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW  The only drink I ever get is the greyhound, so I can't comment on anything more than that. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh and free popcorn! Yay!. END
BEGIN NOW I don't usually drink grapefruit juice but when I do. END
BEGIN NOW this is the place to go, and they add vodka, also. END
BEGIN NOW  Goodness. END
BEGIN NOW  Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW Jess is the man. END
BEGIN NOW  Dude serves hundreds of drinks an hour yet still is friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  This place rocks, 10/10 would blackout again. END
BEGIN NOW I love this bar more than any in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Tonight Connie was the bartender and showed us a great time as always. END
BEGIN NOW  Will come here time and time again. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps one of the best bars in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW  Amazing music - relatively good sound and amazing selection of drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  Additionally, the interior is eclectic. END
BEGIN NOW  Will definitely come back!!!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is amazing! I can't wait to return and have another greyhound ($7 each), I like citrus drinks, my friends though, not so much. END
BEGIN NOW  The atmosphere was fantastic, loved staring at everything and it seemed that everyone was having a great time here. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I could write more on Cafe Van Kleef but I seem to have some fluffy memories after my first greyhound lol Go here and you won't regret it!!!. END
BEGIN NOW Stiff vodka/grapefruit in a big overflowing glass for less than $5 a pop, with live music and some wicked awesome wall decorations? Sold. END
BEGIN NOW  This place rocks!Plus, the people working there are awesome! Say you're occasionally forgetful (like me) and waltz into the Bay for the weekend, conveniently forgetting that boatloads of things require cash. END
BEGIN NOW  Say then also that you go with your fiancee to a place that requires a cover charge. END
BEGIN NOW  D'oh. END
BEGIN NOW But, the guy at the door let us in to use the ATM, which was much appreciated and very kind of him!THEN the ATM that they conveniently have at the bar won't read my debit. END
BEGIN NOW  Double d'oh. END
BEGIN NOW Will they charge the cover to a credit card? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW  And without even a hint of rolling eyes (which I appreciated) problem solved!There is a cover charge to the place, $5 some nights, $10 if the music is extra goodCheap delicious drinks, good service, decent crowd on a Friday night (full, rowdy, but not overstuffed and everyone was happy and polite). END
BEGIN NOW  Worth a visit!. END
BEGIN NOW I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but OMG, get The Greyhound! I swear, it tastes like nectar and once you take a sip you will be converted to the ways of The Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW They use fresh grapefruit juice and put fresh slices of grapefruit in it. END
BEGIN NOW  YUMM! I love the vibe of this place, but it does get cramped in there when it is crowded. END
BEGIN NOW  They also have this little outdoor area in the front where you can smoke, but still not be standing out on the street. END
BEGIN NOW  I love that because I hate having to chug my drink just so I can have a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW  There is interesting art on the walls and interesting people, what more can you ask for. END
BEGIN NOW If nobody has said already. END
BEGIN NOW get the greyhounds!!!!! That's all you need to know. END
BEGIN NOW they're the best here. END
BEGIN NOW  Perhaps is because they make them with fresh squeezed grape fruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar itself it's very interesting and the place has a mix of all kind of decor. END
BEGIN NOW it's a bit small, but well worth the trip!. END
BEGIN NOW Grey goodness. END
BEGIN NOW   This place looks like an ex circus performer became a hoarder, died, and then someone opened a bar in the remnants of their life. END
BEGIN NOW And then started making amazing fresh Greyhounds. END
BEGIN NOW Fun place, I hear the live shows are great in the small space. END
BEGIN NOW Hi how are ya can I order a. END
BEGIN NOW whoah is that a Jackalope?Sorry I got distracted. END
BEGIN NOW can I get a Double shot of Jameso. END
BEGIN NOW is that a figurine of the RCA dog?Ok my bad can I get a Double shot of Jameson - spla. END
BEGIN NOW eww is that a wild boar head??Ok seriously this time! I'll get a. END
BEGIN NOW oh whe. END
BEGIN NOW ma'am?. END
BEGIN NOW where'd she go?*some service they got here*(bartender comes back)Hi!  I'll take a Double shot of Jameson- splash of water and whoah is that a naked lookin geisha playing a trumpet!(my friend Keegan interrupts) AND A GREYHOUND, please. END
BEGIN NOW (bartender smiles and nods to my friend as if bonded by my annoying presence)Is that a buddha smoking a joint?Is that a wolf's head?  Oh wait, it's a fox. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Jimi Hendrix next to that pirate ship?Way too much shit goin on here. END
BEGIN NOW It's like an episode of Hoarders. END
BEGIN NOW haha, right?(Keegan is ignoring me)Do you think they sell this stuff? I ask him. END
BEGIN NOW *regulars look at me in horror*Guess not. END
BEGIN NOW (((well shit it looks like a g'dam garage sale up in here, I whisper to him)))Keegan: It's supposed to *sneeze*Bless you. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan: Thanks *sneeze* look like *sneeze*Bless you. END
BEGIN NOW   Bless you. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan: This. END
BEGIN NOW   It's SUPPOSED to look like *sneeze* this. END
BEGIN NOW  Bless you. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan:  Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW   It's eclecti-haaaaaaa-chooo!Bless you. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan: Fuck! Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW   It's an eclectic collection. END
BEGIN NOW   I heard its from homeboys travels or something. END
BEGIN NOW It's kitschy, you mean. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan: Yes! That's exactly *sneeze* *sneeze* *sneeze* That's it. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm outta here. END
BEGIN NOW  *sneeze* Fuck!Geez get it together wouldja? You're embarrassing meKeegan: (gives me a stern look) I'm gonna get some air. END
BEGIN NOW   BRB. END
BEGIN NOW 10 minutes later. END
BEGIN NOW Feel better?Keegan: Much. END
BEGIN NOW  *sneeze*Orrrr not. END
BEGIN NOW   Bless you. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan: (clearly disgruntled) Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't think we should hang out anymore. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm obviously allergic to you. END
BEGIN NOW  *sneeze* See?  *sneeze*Pssh. END
BEGIN NOW   It's probably all the dust from the kitschy. END
BEGIN NOW Keegan:  Yeah no joke. END
BEGIN NOW   Is your drink good though? Supposed to be what they're known for. END
BEGIN NOW   The Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW   *blows nose*Yeah its grapefruity. END
BEGIN NOW  But stiff. END
BEGIN NOW   Wanna taste?Keegan: no *sneeze* thanks. END
BEGIN NOW   Goddddddddd now I'M the annoying one here!Hey!Keegan: Let's get outta here. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm dying. END
BEGIN NOW  (grabs my hand. END
BEGIN NOW starts to weave me thru the crowd). END
BEGIN NOW but I haven't seen everything yet!  Like that there - is that a mermaid?!  And is that a pineapple, or an urn?  Is that a dude's schlong???Oh wait eww. END
BEGIN NOW  That's real. END
BEGIN NOW   (holds on to Keegan's hand tighter)  Gross, walk faster!  *overheard while weaving our way out*Girl: What's with all the junk. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like an episode of Hoarders in here. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh my god is that a Wild Boar?Me: It's from the owner's TRAVELS, it's not junk. END
BEGIN NOW   Psshh. END
BEGIN NOW   Rude. END
BEGIN NOW Girl:  Oh is it? I'm sorry I didn't. END
BEGIN NOW Me:  Hahahahaha! I'm kidding I felt the same way. END
BEGIN NOW  Points down to her waist - Oh, you might wanna watch out for the schlo-Girl:  The what? *poke* Oh EWW!!!Me:  waves - Bye!Keegan: *sneeze*. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere between El Paso and Tijuana, there's a bar that's wall to wall covered with relics from Dusty's Vietnam collection. END
BEGIN NOW  All the collectibles from the women he married and left behind, all the taxidermy from whiskey drenched nights in the woods, the UFO sighting paraphernalia from his days as a disillusioned American. END
BEGIN NOW  Somewhere in Oakland, that's a bar that's just like this. END
BEGIN NOW  A Rip Van Winkle look-a-like keeps his ear tuned to the sound projecting from the stage. END
BEGIN NOW  A band with a vampire vixen a la Tia Carrere, emits a sound akin to Gogol Bordello swapping spit with Rammstein. END
BEGIN NOW  Unsettling but strangely captivating. END
BEGIN NOW  A foxy bartender pours me another and another and another while a nice little lady comes over to take my order for fried catfish. END
BEGIN NOW  Can you think of any other bar that even compares? Didn't think so. END
BEGIN NOW The doorman NEVER recognizes you. END
BEGIN NOW  Fine. END
BEGIN NOW  But $7 for a shot of Jim Beam? Fuck off. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Van Kleef, you slay me. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite your trendy and somewhat questionable clientele (myself included, apparently), I come back for the notorious greyhounds and the convenient location (just a couple blocks from my office). END
BEGIN NOW Double nods on what folks have said about the interior resembling the inside of a divey antique faire. END
BEGIN NOW  Kinda creepy at times if you actually take the time to look around. END
BEGIN NOW  I've found that the trick to this place is coming earlier rather than later. END
BEGIN NOW  If you get here too late, they often are charging a cover and have already run out of greyhounds for the night (madness, I know). END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they have live music, which is nice. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, you know your friends that live in the city that will like, NEVER come out to Oakland? They'll come out to Van Kleef-- just lure them in with greyhounds, the quirky decor &amp; the convenience of BART. END
BEGIN NOW  Pro-tip: If you're not attached to the Uptown area for the evening, Room 389 on Grand has happy hour from 4-8PM every day and they make excellent greyhounds as well (although they're not ruby red). END
BEGIN NOW  Freshly squeezed and only $4!. END
BEGIN NOW I come to this place just for the greyhound mixed drinks, though I'm sure they have other drink specials. END
BEGIN NOW   The greyhound mixed drink is made from fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and contains vodka. END
BEGIN NOW   The decoration inside the bar is pretty interesting. END
BEGIN NOW   When I came here they also had a live band performing which was nice. END
BEGIN NOW Great bar!Sierra Nevada's "Torpedo" (8% alcohol) on tap?  Check!  Awesome Greyhounds?  Check!  Little Walter's "Mellow Down Easy" blasting out the speakers?  CHECK!I really dig this place. END
BEGIN NOW   They have live music but I haven't checked that out yet. END
BEGIN NOW   I hear they have "MJ's Brass Boppers" here pretty often and they are a great band. END
BEGIN NOW My only complaints?  All the crap they have on the walls looks pretty dusty, they could turn the lights up just a bit (a little too dark for me), and fix the door on the bathroom so people waiting in line don't have to hear me drop a deuce in the can. END
BEGIN NOW Weak homemade greyhounds, several smokers RIGHT outside the door blowing DEATH into the interior. END
BEGIN NOW  The decor is pretty unique inside, the crowd is hip and lively, and the soul/jazz band playing was entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW  . END
BEGIN NOW But if two if your infamous drinks don't yield this lightweight the slightest buzz and staff doesn't take into account that some abhor secondhand tobacco smoke, I'm Audi 5. END
BEGIN NOW  $5 cover doesn't help either. END
BEGIN NOW Such an awesome place. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never had a greyhound before, so when I ordered it I was surprised about the grapefruit (I hate grapefruit, not their fault though once I noticed, I also noticed I was surrounded by drinks with grapefruits). END
BEGIN NOW  Anyway, I liked the cocktail a lot despite my distaste for grapefruit! The juice they used for those cocktails was freshly squeezed, so it was very good. END
BEGIN NOW  The decor of the bar was kind of like a mardi gras hodgepodge, the lighting was "perfect bar lighting" where it's dimmed and layered but not dark, and the live music playing in the back was hearable from the front near the bar but not so loud you couldn't talk-- really it was a pretty perfect funky dive!. END
BEGIN NOW Greyhounds here are my favorite I've ever tried! The Bar as a whole is super Bohemian and very wacky (in the best possible way). END
BEGIN NOW  If you've ever been to DC, I'd compare it to Madam's Organ. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't come here expecting fancy-ass anything. END
BEGIN NOW  You either 100% love this place, or you leave here as quickly as you came. END
BEGIN NOW  I am the former. END
BEGIN NOW  Very representative of the Oaklandish vibe. END
BEGIN NOW 'Come One, Come All' should be Van Kleef's motto. END
BEGIN NOW  This place definitely represents a nice cross-section of the Oakland population, and is an Oaktown must-have experience. END
BEGIN NOW Grapefruit juice is one of my all time faves. END
BEGIN NOW  Walking in past the smoking area,  smelling the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was close to nostril nirvana. END
BEGIN NOW  A nice smelling bar, sweet. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I did expect the Greyhound to be just a little stronger. END
BEGIN NOW  My trusty companion agreed and mentioned that the drinks seemed to be stronger in the past - maybe this was an off-night?Music-wise, it also wasn't a great night until the harmonica player got on the bar for a solo. END
BEGIN NOW  Until then, the sound levels seemed off, and again, my trusty companion agreed, adding that normally the mic levels for voice vs instruments are a little off. END
BEGIN NOW  It might just be the acoustics from the shape of the place, after all, it's a concrete rectangle filled with a bunch of random, salvaged stuff. END
BEGIN NOW But the harmonica player on the bar was worth more than the $5 cover. END
BEGIN NOW  And over the course of the night, the place filled up and thinned out and filled up again - I can only imagine how horribly crowded it would be on a prime weekend night without cover. END
BEGIN NOW It took me three tries to finally make it inside, even though on numerous nights, I've been a few measly blocks away. END
BEGIN NOW  Once I forgot my ID (party foul!), and another time the $5 cover swayed me and a couple of friends away. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally, finally, finally, I made it last weekend, and hopefully, it won't take another three tries to come back. END
BEGIN NOW Lovin' it. END
BEGIN NOW  When the band on stage is in full swing and you enter Cafe Van Kleef when's it's full and at its prime, the sensory stimulation begins with a waft of a floral/fruity fragrance that turns out to be the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. END
BEGIN NOW  This said grapefruit juice makes vodka--a liquor that normally is a guaranteed dry-heave inducer for me--taste like the nectar of the gods. END
BEGIN NOW  In other words, their greyhounds are INcredible. END
BEGIN NOW  The misc. END
BEGIN NOW  hoarder accouterment hanging on the ceiling (see video/picture whatever), encroaching on the full height of the bar, is a great conversation sparker, whether you're breaking the ice with someone you're getting to know or whether you just need to get validate the person whom you brought there for the first time marvels at "how __ing cool this place is!" as they take pictures of the fun random pictures, signs, medallions, swap meet finds etc. END
BEGIN NOW  that, as I mentioned earlier, coat the bar. END
BEGIN NOW The bar is like some sort of shrine to an interior decorating job I wish I could pull off. END
BEGIN NOW  It's exactly what I want to be looking at when I polish off cheapish greyhounds and I couldn't be happier just chilling at the bar or comfortably trying to name the specifies of the taxidermied fish swimming on the ceiling as I sit at a table further into the place. END
BEGIN NOW  And, the miracle of it all, is that none of the decorative bar or ceiling items are dusty. END
BEGIN NOW  This truly blows me mind--almost more than anything else about the place. END
BEGIN NOW  The ceiling is mighty high and those fish are super hard to reach. END
BEGIN NOW  Mind you, my eye glass prescription needs updating, but I have looked closely and I swear these suckers are sleek and untainted by dust mites. END
BEGIN NOW  Thoroughly impressive. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I find the $5 cover on Friday and Saturday nights highly off-putting. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sure it's crowed control/encouraging a more self-selecting clientele. END
BEGIN NOW but still. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm aiming to go on a Thursday sometime soon, so when I do, I'll report back, but for now--4-starts--because covers BLOW!. END
BEGIN NOW GREYHOUNDS! Even though grapefruits aren't my citrus fruit of choice, these were so good. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is really cool. END
BEGIN NOW  The walls are covered in so many random things I looked like I had an attention disorder because I was looking back and forth trying to take in everything. END
BEGIN NOW You know that scene in "The Hangover" when Stu is waking up and stumbling around, and sees that the hotel room has been absolutely destroyed?  Gone are the tasteful decorations, instead vomited on by a hoarder's house?  That's kind of like this place. END
BEGIN NOW   After trying NEX, we clearly didn't remember the last time we were painfully hungover and decided to come here for more booze. END
BEGIN NOW   By we, I mean the Greek Salad Eating Chode and the Thrilla Gorilla, as well as Ben P (no nickname yet) and his supremely awesome and clearly patient wife. END
BEGIN NOW   Sure, I'll try the Greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW   Never mind that I don't drink vodka anymore, and I've already passed my mixed liquor quota. END
BEGIN NOW   Sure, I'll have a shot of tequila, because I clearly hate myself. END
BEGIN NOW For a Thursday, it was pretty relaxed, not too busy, but I really don't see the point of charging a cover for a band I've never heard of. END
BEGIN NOW   Not that I minded, because they were pretty cute, but bands make it difficult to talk and listen to the first date next to us. END
BEGIN NOW What you can do without speaking is look around at all the stuff. END
BEGIN NOW   And come back because you still haven't seen all the stuff. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like the "I Spy" game on overload. END
BEGIN NOW   Or as the magnet I got for my mom claims "The meaning of life isn't more useless crap?"Go for the atmosphere, stay for the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   As Angelo mentioned, they accept plastic, which is a bonus. END
BEGIN NOW Planned the last DYL here because everyone deserves to know Van Kleefs!  Seriously this spot is 2nd to none and definitely in its own category. END
BEGIN NOW   A very attentive staff and a big thanks to Ina for taking great care of our group. END
BEGIN NOW   The pours where heavy, the Yum Yum (Coconut Juice and Tequila) blew my mind, the diversity at this spot is so beautiful, the crazy art, the blues and jazz bands add a kick to your experience, everyone smiling and chit chatting. END
BEGIN NOW    Seriously yo, it's all about Van Kleef, add one of their specialty Greyhounds on top of all their greatness and well your pretty much in love. END
BEGIN NOW Came here just before watching a concert at Fox theater. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a bit crowded inside, and most of the tables were taken. END
BEGIN NOW   We had a fairly large group accumulate in so when we finally snagged the end of the large table, it was nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Otherwise, a bit odd cause the space isn't used well enough with table spacing. END
BEGIN NOW   It feels weird to stand near the tables, and the bar area is really small to stand around. END
BEGIN NOW   A bit noisy as any other bar, so hard to have conversation with a large group of people. END
BEGIN NOW However, come for the greyhound drinks with an entire slice of grapefruit!  It is a nice refreshing drink to start with and totally great to start the night with. END
BEGIN NOW   A light, non-heavy drink. END
BEGIN NOW Bathroom is for both sexes in the back with a bench you can sit and wait on. END
BEGIN NOW   And it's a clean bathroom!. END
BEGIN NOW I first fell in love with  Fresh Stoli Greyhounds at a local dive in my town that is no longer around. END
BEGIN NOW   Just recently got reunited with one of my all time favorite potent potables. END
BEGIN NOW   Except here they up it a notch by serving it in a bucket (fist pump), and garnish your fresh squeezed pink grapefruit/vodka beverage with a quarter wedge of fresh grapefruit (double fist pump). END
BEGIN NOW These drinks are so light they're lethal. END
BEGIN NOW   They're so light, I wanted to work out after having two. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't. END
BEGIN NOW but I wanted to. END
BEGIN NOW I just try and get out by 11pm to avoid being elbow to elbow with hipsters. END
BEGIN NOW   When I do, easily a 5 star experience!. END
BEGIN NOW Fun and kitschy bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Good drinks and smiling faces from the bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  I could walk around this place all night long, just checking out all the "stuff" that is on the walls and filling every nook and cranny from front to back. END
BEGIN NOW Come for the greyhounds, stay for the atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW This is exactly my style. END
BEGIN NOW  A lot of shit on the walls to stare at, and strong drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  A must-go for anyone in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW The decor is mind boggling in this weird ass joint. END
BEGIN NOW  Heard some great music here. END
BEGIN NOW  Great place to go and let your freak flag fly. END
BEGIN NOW OH MY GOD! The Alameda Antique Fair just exploded in this bar!Calm down, it didn't, I was just joking. END
BEGIN NOW  Relax. END
BEGIN NOW  Have a greyhound. END
BEGIN NOW  So, this bar is pretty rad, but the few times I've been here, I've sort of stuck to the front because we've just popped in for a quick one before hitting up another event. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel bad because our time here is always fleeting, but the bouncer always seems to let us sneak in for one without dealing with the cover. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice bouncers are hard to find these days, maybe they pay them in knick knacks. END
BEGIN NOW So pretty much one of the coolest places I've stumbled into in the oakland area since I moved here. END
BEGIN NOW  The seemingly non-descript entrance leads to a crazy art hole usually packed with people standing or sitting. END
BEGIN NOW  The entrance has an outdoor but covered area where people hang out and smoke. END
BEGIN NOW  Expect to get ID'd here, but once you're in you're chill. END
BEGIN NOW  The bouncer is real good with faces. END
BEGIN NOW  The interior has things hanging from the ceiling, cool lights, old movie props, random sculpture, and a generally dark, but cool ambience. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is well known for it's grey hounds and behind the bar one can find a bar back literally cutting and squeezing grapefruit all night long. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar itself is like a long skinny hallway and it can get really packed on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW  In the very back is a tiny stage where there's live music playing on a regular basis. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never been blown away by the bands there except in the sense that the music is so loud you have to yell to talk, but that said it's good to have something playing than not. END
BEGIN NOW  Otherwise they play the most random music. END
BEGIN NOW  Classic rock to american country sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW  Currently the grey hounds run 7$ so not cheap, but they have the standard stuff on tap for beer too. END
BEGIN NOW All in all this place is a pretty dope place to kick it and hang out for drinks and talk. END
BEGIN NOW  It's not the kinda place to get wasted at but it will def impress people when you take em here. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd recommend this place anytime. END
