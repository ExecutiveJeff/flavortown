BEGIN NOW Birds chirp. The sun shines. Blue skies for miles. In END
BEGIN NOW short, a damn fine day to be alive. And then: END
BEGIN NOW A DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE END
BEGIN NOW Jerks to a stop in front of the holy edifice. Out of the END
BEGIN NOW beat-to-shit Carrera convertible climbs: END
BEGIN NOW HANK MOODY END
BEGIN NOW A man in his thirties. A figure in black. END
BEGIN NOW He's good-looking, yeah, but the thing that's always helped END
BEGIN NOW Hank with the opposite sex is the fact that he simply doesn't END
BEGIN NOW give a rat’s ass what anyone thinks about him. END
BEGIN NOW He removes his sunglasses. Winces in disgust. END
BEGIN NOW Hank is not a guy who appreciates the birds and the sun and END
BEGIN NOW tranquility of nature and whatnot. END
BEGIN NOW INSIDE THE CHURCH END
BEGIN NOW Hank saunters in, immediately at odds with the holy vibe. END
BEGIN NOW The place is dark. Cold. Empty. END
BEGIN NOW He snuffs his cigarette in a nearby bowl of Holy H2O. His END
BEGIN NOW footsteps loud as hell as he makes his way down the center END
BEGIN NOW aisle. He arrives at the altar. Looks up. And there he is: END
BEGIN NOW THE MAN HIMSELF END
BEGIN NOW Up on the cross. Hanging out. Doing his thing. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Alright, big guy. You and me... we've END
BEGIN NOW never done this. But desperate times END
BEGIN NOW call for desperate measures. My name is END
BEGIN NOW Hank -- END
BEGIN NOW A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Hank. END
BEGIN NOW Hank reacts, startled, as END
BEGIN NOW A YOUNG NUN END
BEGIN NOW Emerges from the holy green room. Full habit, headdress, and END
BEGIN NOW everything. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hey. Sorry about that. I was just END
BEGIN NOW having a little chat with the guy on the END
BEGIN NOW wall up here. END
BEGIN NOW YOUNG NUN END
BEGIN NOW Is there something I can help you with? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I wouldn’t want to bother a real, END
BEGIN NOW live person. I was just -- END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW fact, that's what I'm here for. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW You're very pleasant, sister. Very END
BEGIN NOW agreeable. END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW I think you'll find that I'm very END
BEGIN NOW agreeable indeed. END
BEGIN NOW She smiles. It’s a pretty smile. Some might say sexy. END
BEGIN NOW Which weirds Hank out a little bit. Or maybe it turns him END
BEGIN NOW on. Hard to say. END
BEGIN NOW He gives the Nun a closer look. Pretty eyes, perfect skin. END
BEGIN NOW Despite the holy garb and all that, the girl is attractive. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? Maybe the holy garb helps. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Here's the thing. I've been having what END
BEGIN NOW you might call a crisis of faith. Put END
BEGIN NOW simply, I’m an addict. END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW (a knowing nod) END
BEGIN NOW Drugs and alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW A little bit, yeah. But that stuff I can END
BEGIN NOW handle. It’s the sex that’s killing me, END
BEGIN NOW sister. You’re looking at a goddamn END
BEGIN NOW fucking sex addict. END
BEGIN NOW (catches himself) END
BEGIN NOW Sorry about that. I fucked up. Once END
BEGIN NOW again. My apologies. END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW Well, normally I would suggest a bunch of END
BEGIN NOW “Our Father’s” and a couple of “Hail END
BEGIN NOW Mary’s,” but I don't think that’s gonna END
BEGIN NOW get it done. END
BEGIN NOW She ponders for a moment. Looks up. Smiles. END
BEGIN NOW 2. END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW What about a blowjob? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Come again? END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW A blowjob. Would that make you feel any END
BEGIN NOW better? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW A blowjob...? From you...? END
BEGIN NOW The Nun eyes Hank's crotch. END
BEGIN NOW NUN END
BEGIN NOW Something tells me it's not gonna suck END
BEGIN NOW itself, Hank. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW But you're a nun. END
BEGIN NOW She pulls off her headgear. Beautiful blonde hair spills out END
BEGIN NOW all over. Jenna Jameson in a habit. Hank stares, gulps. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW A totally fucking hot nun. END
BEGIN NOW The Nun walks up to him. Close. Unzips his pants. Proceeds END
BEGIN NOW to go down on him. Hank groans... END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Judas Priest... END
BEGIN NOW INT. A BEDROOM SOMEWHERE - DAY END
BEGIN NOW Hank wakes. Simultaneously screaming and cumming. A blur of END
BEGIN NOW flesh and white sheets. A trashy yet indisputably hot young END
BEGIN NOW woman emerges from underneath, wiping her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW This is HEATHER. The nun from the dream. A prototypical END
BEGIN NOW California blonde if ever there was one. Simply stunning. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW Bad dream...? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Well... hard to say, really. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW You drifted off. And I thought to END
BEGIN NOW myself, “Self, what's the nicest possible END
BEGIN NOW way I could wake up Mr. Hank here?” END
BEGIN NOW 3. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Well, kudos to you, because you END
BEGIN NOW definitely stumbled upon one of the nicer END
BEGIN NOW ways. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW You're nice to me, I'm nice to you. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Very quid pro quo. END
BEGIN NOW (off her look) END
BEGIN NOW Never mind. END
BEGIN NOW Hank grabs a pack of cigarettes off the night stand. Lights END
BEGIN NOW two. Hands one to Heather. They smoke in silence. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW Can I tell you something? END
BEGIN NOW Hank is afraid. Very afraid. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Sure. Anything. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW My husband has never given me an orgasm. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Never? END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW Ever. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW You’re shitting me. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW I shit you not. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Does he... you know...? END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW Go downtown? Never. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Ever? END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW Well, no, that's not true. He did. END
BEGIN NOW Once. But he made me take a shower END
BEGIN NOW first. And then spent forty-five minutes END
BEGIN NOW trying to find my clit. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW How'd he do? END
BEGIN NOW 4. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW Not so good. I mean, he came within END
BEGIN NOW spitting distance a couple of times, but END
BEGIN NOW then he veered off in some other END
BEGIN NOW direction. I think he thinks it's on the END
BEGIN NOW bottom. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Near the vaganus? That's weird. END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW I thought so. END
BEGIN NOW Hank grins, disappears under the sheets. From the look on END
BEGIN NOW her face, it appears as though he has struck gold. END
BEGIN NOW And then comes the unmistakable SOUND of THE FRONT DOOR END
BEGIN NOW OPENING AND CLOSING. Heather's smile disappears. Hank pops END
BEGIN NOW up -- END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What the fuck is that? END
BEGIN NOW HEATHER END
BEGIN NOW That would be my husband. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, so the guy can't find your clit, but END
BEGIN NOW he has no problem finding you legs END
BEGIN NOW akimbo? END
BEGIN NOW Hank jumps out of bed. Yanking on boxers and a T-shirt. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Well, m’lady, it’s been a slice, but END
BEGIN NOW seeing as I’s a lover, not a fighter, END
BEGIN NOW it’s time for this fella to put on his END
BEGIN NOW dancing shoes... if I could find them, END
BEGIN NOW that is... END
BEGIN NOW He can’t find his shoes. Or his pants. And the FOOTSTEPS END
BEGIN NOW are getting closer. He shrugs. Starts to go. Returns for a END
BEGIN NOW kiss and then tears ass through the sliding glass doors... END
BEGIN NOW OUT ONTO A STRETCH OF MALIBU BEACHFRONT END
BEGIN NOW A postcard-worthy snapshot of SoCal bliss that Hank has END
BEGIN NOW neither the time or the luxury to appreciate. He creeps END
BEGIN NOW along the side of the house, wincing at ALL THE YELLING END
BEGIN NOW coming from inside, finally ending up... END
BEGIN NOW IN THE DRIVEWAY END
BEGIN NOW Where his DIRTY BLACK PORSCHE awaits. He hops in the car... END
BEGIN NOW fires it up... Billy Idol’s cover of The Doors’ “L.A. Woman” END
BEGIN NOW playing on the stereo... END
BEGIN NOW 5. END
BEGIN NOW He closes his eyes, says a silent prayer for escaping almost END
BEGIN NOW certain death, and when he opens them again... END
BEGIN NOW A TATTOOED MILLIONAIRE END
BEGIN NOW Is standing in front of the car. Baseball bat in hand. A END
BEGIN NOW murderous, cuckolded gleam in his eye. A frazzled, halfnaked END
BEGIN NOW Heather watching from the front door. Hank sighs. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Dude. Just so you know? The little man END
BEGIN NOW in the boat? He’s on the top. END
BEGIN NOW The Husband is confused. Hank wags his tongue between index END
BEGIN NOW and middle finger in a rather crude simulation of END
BEGIN NOW cunnilingus. Winks at Heather. END
BEGIN NOW Then he GUNS IT -- END
BEGIN NOW Outraged, the Husband swings, takes out a tailight or some END
BEGIN NOW such, but it’s too late... he’s gone... out into the middle END

BEGIN NOW and their dangerously cute pre-teen daughter, END
BEGIN NOW BECCA, 12, waiting for him. END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, it must be date night. END

BEGIN NOW Come on, Mom... END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, baby. END

BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW You’re a classy guy, Hank. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW That's funny. Coming from you and all. END
BEGIN NOW Karen bites her tongue. Gets in the car. Becca waves. END

BEGIN NOW Dad? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, baby? END

BEGIN NOW Can we watch “Anchorman”? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END

BEGIN NOW A MAN'S VOICE END
BEGIN NOW (on the machine) END
BEGIN NOW Hank. Your friend, but more END

BEGIN NOW Hey, Dad? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW “Anchorman,” right. Let's get on that. END

BEGIN NOW Wait right here. END
BEGIN NOW IN THE BEDROOM END
BEGIN NOW There is in fact a NAKED WOMAN in Hank's bedroom. END
BEGIN NOW On his bed, to be more specific. Wrapped up in the sheets. END
BEGIN NOW Looking somewhat chagrined. Hank enters. Naked Lady smiles. END
BEGIN NOW Her name is SANDY. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing here? END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW I thought I'd surprise you. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Well, you surprised my daughter. END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW So that's Becca. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW That's Becca alright. END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry, Hank. I should've called. I END
BEGIN NOW just thought... END
BEGIN NOW Hank softens, sits on the edge of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW 8. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Hey, I'm sorry, too. In fact... maybe we END
BEGIN NOW should think about cooling things off a END
BEGIN NOW little... END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW ...or not. Either way. I'm easy. END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW So you don't want to see me anymore? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW That's not what I said. END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW You're amazing, Hank. You spend all this END
BEGIN NOW time sweet-talking me into the sack and END
BEGIN NOW now that you've exacted your revenge, END
BEGIN NOW you're done with me? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Revenge? What are you talking about, END
BEGIN NOW revenge? END
BEGIN NOW SANDY END
BEGIN NOW Come on, you can't tell me that it wasn't END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Well, when you put it that way... END

BEGIN NOW What other way is there to put it, Hank? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Look, I'm sorry, I got carried away. I'm END

BEGIN NOW let you off easy here. But you know END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Great. So not only do you give lousy END

BEGIN NOW too. END
BEGIN NOW 9. END
BEGIN NOW That's when Becca enters, juggling a couple of beers and a END

BEGIN NOW BECCA END
BEGIN NOW Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW They all drink up. A moment. END
BEGIN NOW BECCA END
BEGIN NOW (to Sandy) END

BEGIN NOW INT. HANK'S CONDO - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Hank has fallen asleep on the couch while watching TV with END
BEGIN NOW Becca. She laughs, looks, sees that he is asleep. She gets END
BEGIN NOW up off the couch, disappears. Returns a moment later with a END
BEGIN NOW blanket. Drapes it over him. END
BEGIN NOW A knock at the door. Becca opens it to Karen. Shushes her. END
BEGIN NOW They both look at the snoozing Hank with a mixture of END
BEGIN NOW sadness, anger and regret. END
BEGIN NOW BECCA END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I wish we could take him home END
BEGIN NOW with us. END
BEGIN NOW Karen’s heart breaks, but she keeps it together for Becca. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Go wait in the car, okay? END
BEGIN NOW Becca shoots her mother a look. Gives her sleeping father a END

BEGIN NOW What? Whatsa matter? END
BEGIN NOW (off her look) END
BEGIN NOW Uh-oh. I know that look. That’s not a END

BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW And why would I be happy, Hank? END

BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Cute. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW The guy can't help it. He’s cute. END

BEGIN NOW in your bedroom. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, she mentioned that? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END

BEGIN NOW So, what? You're jealous? END

BEGIN NOW over. END
BEGIN NOW Which does a pretty good job of shutting him up. END

BEGIN NOW Okay, are you trying to make me throw up? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you're one to talk. You're out there END
BEGIN NOW sticking your dick in anything that END

BEGIN NOW Beat. Hank softens. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you're right. Okay, no maybes. END
BEGIN NOW You're right. I'm a mess. I need some END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Because he’s a fucking dial tone. He's END

BEGIN NOW Because I know you. END

BEGIN NOW Yeah, I guess not. END
BEGIN NOW (then) END
BEGIN NOW So that's it, huh? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW I guess so. END

BEGIN NOW INT. HANK'S CONDO - THE NEXT DAY END
BEGIN NOW Hank sits at the kitching table, staring at his Mac laptop. END
BEGIN NOW He launches Microsoft Word, comforted by the familiar startup END
BEGIN NOW screen. And then there it is: END
BEGIN NOW THE BLANK SCREEN END
BEGIN NOW The cursor blinks. Silently mocking him. END
BEGIN NOW He shifts in his seat, uncomfortable. He types the word END
BEGIN NOW "fuck" and holds down the "k" for a long time, filling the END
BEGIN NOW page. END
BEGIN NOW He sighs. Takes a sip of coffee. END
BEGIN NOW He launches the browser. Starts perusing internet porn. END
BEGIN NOW 13. END
BEGIN NOW EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Where the movie adaptation of Hank's novel is playing. “A END

BEGIN NOW turns away, walks back, buys a ticket. END
BEGIN NOW INT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER END
BEGIN NOW Hank walks into the dark theater, Coke and popcorn in hand. END
BEGIN NOW Movie in progress. He finds a seat. Digs into his popcorn. END
BEGIN NOW A cellphone RINGS. Right in front of him. END
BEGIN NOW Hank sighs as the GUY in front of him -- some twentysomething END
BEGIN NOW Persian wannbe-gangsta-type -- proceeds to answer... END
BEGIN NOW CELLPHONE PERSIAN END
BEGIN NOW (into phone) END
BEGIN NOW Talk to me. Hey, baby... wassup? I'm at END
BEGIN NOW the movies. What's going on? Fuck, END
BEGIN NOW babe, I miss you, too... END
BEGIN NOW Hank gives it a minute. When he realizes this is not going END
BEGIN NOW to end anytime soon, he sighs, resigned to his fate. He END
BEGIN NOW carefully places his Coke and popcorn on the floor. Taps END
BEGIN NOW Cellphone Persian on the shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Come on, buddy, gimme a break... END
BEGIN NOW Without so much as a look back, Cellphone Persian gives him END
BEGIN NOW the finger. Hank chuckles to himself. He reaches forward. END
BEGIN NOW Grabs the cellphone out of the guy's hand. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW (into phone) END
BEGIN NOW Hello? Hi. Sorry. The asshole you're END
BEGIN NOW calling is gonna have to give you a call END
BEGIN NOW back. Later. After the movie. 'Kay? END

BEGIN NOW Hank hangs up. Hands the phone to said Asshole, who is END

BEGIN NOW At this point, OTHER MOVIE-GOERS are watching, curious. END
BEGIN NOW Hank picks up his Coke and popcorn, points to the screen. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW (whispers) END
BEGIN NOW The book was way better. END
BEGIN NOW The phone RINGS again. Cellphone Persian looks at Hank. END
BEGIN NOW Like a child testing a parent. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Don't do it. Don't you do it... END
BEGIN NOW 14. END
BEGIN NOW He answers it. Starts having his conversation all over END
BEGIN NOW again. This time, Hank shakes his head. Heaves a heavy END
BEGIN NOW sigh. Weight of the world and whatnot. Puts down his Coke END
BEGIN NOW and popcorn again. END
BEGIN NOW All of a sudden, he yanks the phone out of the guy's hand. END
BEGIN NOW Hurls it against the wall, shattering it. END
BEGIN NOW The guy jumps to his feet. Hank just looks at him. Weary. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Are you sure? Are you absolutely END
BEGIN NOW positive you want to do this? I mean, END
BEGIN NOW 'cause you could just apologize and we'll END

BEGIN NOW They're good. I'll get you one. END
BEGIN NOW CELLPHONE PERSIAN END
BEGIN NOW Fuck. You. END
BEGIN NOW Hank climbs slowly to his feet. One punch. Two. He END
BEGIN NOW proceeds to beat the living shit out of Cellphone Persian. END
BEGIN NOW In the process, the movie stops and the lights come up. END
BEGIN NOW Hank keeps on kicking ass until Cellphone Persian is just a END
BEGIN NOW bloody, blubbering mess on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Next time, just put it on fucking vibrate END
BEGIN NOW or something, okay? Or I don't know, END
BEGIN NOW turn it off maybe. God forbid you miss a END

BEGIN NOW A YOUNG WOMAN IS WATCHING HIM END
BEGIN NOW Sitting in a big, comfy chair all her own. Opposite him. END
BEGIN NOW Also reading his book. She looks at the picture of Hank on END

BEGIN NOW one is looking a little worse for wear. END
BEGIN NOW Her name is MIA. Smart. Sexy. Long, dark hair. Collegeage. END
BEGIN NOW She smiles, watching Hank smile. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Looks up. Catches her looking at him. He looks down again, END
BEGIN NOW embarrassed. Then, feeling sheepish, he looks up. Gives her END
BEGIN NOW a look. "You got me." She smiles. Fashions her hand into a END
BEGIN NOW pistol and shoots him. END
BEGIN NOW Hank points to the empty seat next to her. "Can I?" She END
BEGIN NOW shrugs. "Sure." He gets up, walks over. Sits down. She END
BEGIN NOW wrinkles her face, annoyed. END

BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? You were like, "Sure. END

BEGIN NOW Which hardly seems a compliment. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Hey -- what do you know about it, lady? END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW Does the word "duh" mean anything to you? END

BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW (disgusted) END
BEGIN NOW Wait a second -- you're married? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no. Not married. So not married. END
BEGIN NOW Divorced. Fairly recently. Haven't END

BEGIN NOW Well, now I'm definitely for sure END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Why not?! END
BEGIN NOW 20. END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW Because you're like this wounded bird. END

BEGIN NOW No, ma'am, I do not. END

BEGIN NOW Are you gonna...? END
BEGIN NOW Hank nods. Mia smiles. And just as he's about to... END
BEGIN NOW SHE PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE END
BEGIN NOW A mixture of pain and pleasure so intense Hank doesn't know END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What the...?! END
BEGIN NOW Mia punches him in the face again. Just as hard. END
BEGIN NOW Hank tries to get out from under her, but she grinds away on END

BEGIN NOW PENNY END
BEGIN NOW No, it’s okay. He’s right. END

BEGIN NOW What?! END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Thank god... END

BEGIN NOW She’s a lesbian. Thank god. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW What are you talking about? END
BEGIN NOW 23. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW I’ve prayed for this. Look, I’m sure we END

BEGIN NOW (pumps his fist) END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Unbelievable... END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW (disappointed) END
BEGIN NOW She’s not...? END
BEGIN NOW PENNY END
BEGIN NOW Based on what I’ve seen, no. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW So why are we discussing her sexuality? END
BEGIN NOW PENNY END
BEGIN NOW Because she seems to have very recently END

BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Well, she is beautiful. END

BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW No. You’ll just get mad. And that’s END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you talk to her. She’ll end up END

BEGIN NOW Oh my God -- you’re such a fucking prick. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What, I’m not allowed to worry about her, END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW No, but given my fondness for internet END

BEGIN NOW of sorts. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW CHARLIE END
BEGIN NOW They want you to blog for them. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Fuck me. Must be my trick ear. I END

BEGIN NOW CHARLIE END
BEGIN NOW Hear me out. Given your reputation as a END

BEGIN NOW fact that you’ve become something akin to END
BEGIN NOW the Axl Rose of the literary world... END
BEGIN NOW they are very interested in your thoughts END
BEGIN NOW on writing and fucking at the very edge END

BEGIN NOW Full habit, headdress and everything. END
BEGIN NOW CHARLIE END
BEGIN NOW Well, it doesn’t take Freud to figure END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, yeah, yeah... END

BEGIN NOW Wait. Let me try. You grew up in the END

BEGIN NOW Hank pulls to a stop in front of a mammoth North of Montana END
BEGIN NOW home. Karen’s waiting for him. She gets in. He tears off. END
BEGIN NOW INSIDE THE CAR END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Where to? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere up in the Palisades. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Who took her? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Bill’s daughter. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What? I didn’t even know he had a END
BEGIN NOW daughter. How old is she? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Sixteen. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW And you let Becca hang out with her? END
BEGIN NOW Beat. Karen sniffs the air. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW You smell like pussy. END
BEGIN NOW Beat. Hank drives off. END
BEGIN NOW EXT. PALISADES PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Parents are away. Kids are playing. Hard. Hank pulls up on END
BEGIN NOW the lawn, almost taking out a few teenagers. He gets out, END
BEGIN NOW followed by Karen. END
BEGIN NOW INT. PARTY HOUSE END
BEGIN NOW Kids everywhere. Drunk, stoned and coked out of their END
BEGIN NOW brains. Hip-hop blasting on a ridiculously high-end stereo. END
BEGIN NOW An all-out assault on the senses. END
BEGIN NOW 34. END
BEGIN NOW SOME DRUNK KID, booze-emboldened, tries to stop them. END
BEGIN NOW DRUNK KID END
BEGIN NOW Hey, man... END
BEGIN NOW Hank grabs him by the shirt -- END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Becca Moody -- where is she? END
BEGIN NOW DRUNK KID END
BEGIN NOW (gulp) END
BEGIN NOW Upstairs. I think. END
BEGIN NOW Hank tosses him aside. Takes the stairs two at a time. END
BEGIN NOW UPSTAIRS HALLWAY END
BEGIN NOW Hank yanks open a bedroom door. Two teens fucking. END
BEGIN NOW HE BOLTS IN END
BEGIN NOW Looks closer. Not Becca. Thank god. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW As you were. END
BEGIN NOW BACK TO THE HALLWAY END
BEGIN NOW Tries another door. Locked. Kicks it open. Two teens. END
BEGIN NOW Making out on the bed. Getting serious. This time it’s for END
BEGIN NOW real. Becca and some FUTURE FRATBOY on the make. Becca’s END
BEGIN NOW got her shirt off. Just her bra. END
BEGIN NOW Hank freaks. Runs into END
BEGIN NOW THE BEDROOM END
BEGIN NOW And proceeds to kick the living shit out of the guy. END
BEGIN NOW Punching, kicking, slapping. An ugly, embarrassing display END
BEGIN NOW of fury. If the movie theater scene was funny, this is END
BEGIN NOW disturbing. Karen tries to pull him off, all to no avail. END
BEGIN NOW Finally, Becca screams: END
BEGIN NOW BECCA END
BEGIN NOW Daddy!!! END
BEGIN NOW Which snaps him out of it. He stops his pounding. Looks END
BEGIN NOW down. The kid is a bloody mess on the floor. Not dead or END
BEGIN NOW anything -- just a good solid beating. END
BEGIN NOW Becca rushes over, and for just a second, almost as if by END
BEGIN NOW reflex, Hank opens his arms to receive her, but alas it’s not END
BEGIN NOW to be... she runs straight for the boy. END
BEGIN NOW In that one second, Hank is crushed. He looks at Karen. END
BEGIN NOW 35. END
BEGIN NOW And for once, they’re thinking the same thing. Something END
BEGIN NOW approaching empathy passes between them. END
BEGIN NOW INT./EXT. PORSCHE - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Hank pulls up in front of the North of Montana house. END
BEGIN NOW Karen’s next to him. Becca’s in the back, not talking to END
BEGIN NOW either of them. A beat. Hank looks back. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Becca... look... END
BEGIN NOW A beat. Becca fixes him with an icy gaze. END
BEGIN NOW BECCA END
BEGIN NOW I hate you. END
BEGIN NOW That said, she gets out of the car, runs into the house. END
BEGIN NOW Hank sags, a dagger through the heart. Karen looks at him, END
BEGIN NOW sympathizes. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Guess I deserve that. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW No one deserves that. END
BEGIN NOW (then) END
BEGIN NOW Wanna come in? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What about...? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW He’s out of town. END
BEGIN NOW A beat. Hank nods. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW But only if you wash the pussy off. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Deal. END
BEGIN NOW INT. KAREN & BILL’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Hank washes up in a luxurious bathroom. Looks in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn’t much like what he sees looking back. He opens the END
BEGIN NOW medicine cabinet. Finds a bottle of Perocet. Pops a couple. END
BEGIN NOW IN THE HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER END
BEGIN NOW Hank walks down the hallway. Stops at his daughter’s room. END
BEGIN NOW She’s on her bed, back to him. He’s unsure whether or not he END
BEGIN NOW should walk in. She picks up a remote. Presses a button. END
BEGIN NOW The door shuts in his face. END
BEGIN NOW 36. END
BEGIN NOW IN THE KITCHEN END
BEGIN NOW Hank, Karen and coffee. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Well, that happened. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, and it was going to happen sooner END
BEGIN NOW or later. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW So you’re saying I was wrong? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW You did exactly what I wanted to do. END
BEGIN NOW Which still doesn’t make it right. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW I just reacted. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Yeah... well... you’ve always been a END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Which, oddly enough, is the title of my END

BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW What next novel? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW What are we talking about here? Our END
BEGIN NOW daughter or my writing? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Kind of the same thing, isn’t it? END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Hey, you called me. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Your daughter didn’t come home. I END
BEGIN NOW thought you should know. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Bullshit. You were alone. You wanted me END
BEGIN NOW to handle it. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW You say that like it’s a bad thing. I END
BEGIN NOW want you in my life, Hank. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW (teases) END
BEGIN NOW Because you love me. Because you want to END
BEGIN NOW have like ten-thousand more of my babies. END
BEGIN NOW 37. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW (rolls her eyes) END
BEGIN NOW Because how Becca turns out is our END
BEGIN NOW responsibility. Like it or not, we’re END
BEGIN NOW tied to each other for life. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Minus the obvious sexual benefits. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I’m sure I couldn’t hold a candle to END
BEGIN NOW the multidude of skanks that have come END
BEGIN NOW along since. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Hey, don’t sell yourself short. If I END
BEGIN NOW remember correctly, our problems didn’t END
BEGIN NOW extend to the bedroom. END
BEGIN NOW A hint of a smile from Karen. Which pleases Hank to no end. END
BEGIN NOW And then -- the SOUND of the front door slamming. Footsteps. END
BEGIN NOW A girl walks into the kitchen. A pretty girl. And if she END
BEGIN NOW looks familiar, it’s because we’ve met her before. END
BEGIN NOW Hank chokes. Spills coffee all over. Jumps to his feet. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Fuck!!! END
BEGIN NOW The girl is Mia. END
BEGIN NOW From the book store. From the coffee shop. She of the END
BEGIN NOW fucking and the punching. END
BEGIN NOW Fuck indeed. END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW I am so sorry. Are you okay? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Hank, this is Bill’s daughter, Mia. END
BEGIN NOW Stunned silence from Hank. Mia smiles. Karen takes it in. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Do you two know each other...? END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW Well... END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW No -- we do not know each other. END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW ...I do recognize you. END
BEGIN NOW 38. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW No, you don’t -- END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW Sure I do... END
BEGIN NOW (then) END
BEGIN NOW From your book. Your picture’s on the END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I see... END
BEGIN NOW Karen’s already moved on -- END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW What happened tonight, Mia? END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW Look, I told her to be careful. I told END
BEGIN NOW her to pace herself. I told her to stay END
BEGIN NOW away from that guy, but there’s only so END
BEGIN NOW much one gal can do, you know? END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW Well, at least you called. I appreciate END
BEGIN NOW that. END
BEGIN NOW MIA END
BEGIN NOW How is she? END

BEGIN NOW She is, actually. A good kid. END
BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW How, um, old is she? END

BEGIN NOW HANK END
BEGIN NOW Sixteen. Wow. END
BEGIN NOW KAREN END
BEGIN NOW I know what you’re thinking. END

BEGIN NOW with my mom in a tiny apartment END
BEGIN NOW building with no air conditioning. END
BEGIN NOW In the summer, it would get so hot END
BEGIN NOW that at night everyone would sleep END
BEGIN NOW out on their fire escapes. Anyway, END
BEGIN NOW my dad drove a cab. A miserable, END
BEGIN NOW sweaty little cab. Six days a END
BEGIN NOW week. Then on Sundays, he and his END
BEGIN NOW friends would gather in our living END
BEGIN NOW room to watch the fights and share END
BEGIN NOW some cold beer. And from the END
BEGIN NOW kitchen, I'd watch them laughing, END
BEGIN NOW and talking, and yelling at the TV, END

BEGIN NOW I'm not done. Well, one Sunday END
BEGIN NOW morning, I got up and found the END

BEGIN NOW was already getting hot, and my END
BEGIN NOW dad's beer was starting to warm up. END
BEGIN NOW So I rode my bike to the dairy and END
BEGIN NOW started filling an orange crate END
BEGIN NOW with ice. I made three trips END
BEGIN NOW before I had enough to keep the END
BEGIN NOW beer cold. When my dad saw what I END
BEGIN NOW did, he put his arm around me and END
BEGIN NOW told me I was all right. He even END
BEGIN NOW let me watch the fights with him. END
BEGIN NOW That day I realized that beer is END
BEGIN NOW the common denominator. The END
BEGIN NOW wrecking ball that tears down the END
BEGIN NOW walls between people. I'm sorry, END
BEGIN NOW Mike, but if Norm Peterson comes END
BEGIN NOW across an imperfect brew, it will END

BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW You remember. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW How could I forget? I still can’t END

BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW What’s my lawyer doing on campus? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I’m a student. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW That can’t be an inspiring journey. END
BEGIN NOW Duncan goes to a dorm-sized fridge and grabs two beers. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Eh, those ivy league twits on the END
BEGIN NOW state bar have had me under a END
BEGIN NOW microscope since I started. END
BEGIN NOW They’ve suddenly decided that even END
BEGIN NOW though I have a law degree, my END
BEGIN NOW college degree isn’t “legitimate.” END
BEGIN NOW Duncan hands Jeff one of the beers. END
BEGIN NOW 6. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW I thought you had a bachelor’s from END
BEGIN NOW Columbia. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW And now I have to get one from END
BEGIN NOW America. They must have noticed END
BEGIN NOW the eagle in the seal was holding END
BEGIN NOW coffee branches. I’m dead in the END
BEGIN NOW water until I replace that degree. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW If you’re in my class, I hope END
BEGIN NOW you’re not going to ask for special END
BEGIN NOW treatment. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Professor, please, I do have rules. END
BEGIN NOW I would never take psychology, it’s END
BEGIN NOW boring. But I was hoping that, as END
BEGIN NOW a teacher, you could get me all the END
BEGIN NOW quizzes, tests and exams for the END
BEGIN NOW classes I am taking this semester. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff places a sheet of paper on Duncan’s desk. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Jeff, you just described - no, END
BEGIN NOW defined cheating. Not only is it END
BEGIN NOW illegal, it’s unethical. END
BEGIN NOW He takes a drink of his own beer. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Well, laws are tools. We reshape END
BEGIN NOW them to suit the job. And you END
BEGIN NOW seemed less concerned with ethics END
BEGIN NOW the day I convinced twelve of your END
BEGIN NOW peers that when you did a U turn on END
BEGIN NOW a freeway and tried to order END

BEGIN NOW box, your only real crime was being END
BEGIN NOW an American. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW You’re saying I owe you. END

BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW That’s not small talk? END

BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW What’s your deal and IS GOD DEAD?! END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Alright. My deal. I dropped out END
BEGIN NOW of high school to pursue my love of END
BEGIN NOW anarchy. I made a lot of new END
BEGIN NOW friends vandalizing billboards, I END
BEGIN NOW helped coordinate us into a very END
BEGIN NOW large, successful movement of END
BEGIN NOW anarchist billboard vandals, and we END
BEGIN NOW decided I was the leader, which END
BEGIN NOW meant we had to kick me out, END
BEGIN NOW because we were anarchists. Soon END
BEGIN NOW after, they became an advertising END
BEGIN NOW firm. One of their shampoo END
BEGIN NOW billboards is across the street. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW The one that says “hey, it’s your END
BEGIN NOW hair, we just want to clean it?” END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Power to the people. And you can END
BEGIN NOW go on Facebook and see photos of END
BEGIN NOW their children, who have names like END
BEGIN NOW Hemingway and Chomsky and who are END
BEGIN NOW seated in the backs of SUVs. So I END
BEGIN NOW guess my deal is, be honest with me END
BEGIN NOW and I’ll like you. Because I may END
BEGIN NOW be broke and “crawling back to END

BEGIN NOW learned that what’s most important END

BEGIN NOW Well, yeah, and we’re students, END
BEGIN NOW from different backgrounds, and I’m END

BEGIN NOW ABED END

BEGIN NOW Suppose I did feel indebted to you, END

BEGIN NOW like that way closer to wherever END

BEGIN NOW I’m asking if you understand the END

BEGIN NOW 12. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I understand “right” and “wrong” END
BEGIN NOW are slippery slopes that end with END
BEGIN NOW presidents who don’t believe END
BEGIN NOW dinosaurs existed. And I’ve END
BEGIN NOW understood since I was a kid that END
BEGIN NOW if I talked long enough, I could END
BEGIN NOW make anything true. So either I’m END

BEGIN NOW remember the first day of class, I END
BEGIN NOW asked if anyone was interested in END
BEGIN NOW starting a Spanish study group, and END
BEGIN NOW passed around a sign-up sheet, and END

BEGIN NOW get grabbed by the hair and have END
BEGIN NOW their faces put through jukeboxes. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW (blurting) END
BEGIN NOW Seriously! END
BEGIN NOW Britta quickly composes herself. Annie pouts. Shirley END
BEGIN NOW regains her shyness. Pierce gives her head a supportive END
BEGIN NOW stroke, causing her to wince. Jeff points a pen at Pierce, END
BEGIN NOW shifting to what he hopes is even more fertile ground for END
BEGIN NOW sowing discontent. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Pierce, let’s discuss this END
BEGIN NOW creepiness. END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW I beg your pardon? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Are you unaware Shirley finds your END
BEGIN NOW advances inappropriate? END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW What advances? END
BEGIN NOW SHIRLEY END
BEGIN NOW You have been sexually harassing me END
BEGIN NOW since the first day of class! END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW “Sexually harassing?” That doesn’t END
BEGIN NOW make sense, why would I “harass” END
BEGIN NOW someone that turns me on? END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW Saying she turns you on is the END
BEGIN NOW harrassment, buddy. END
BEGIN NOW Pierce slams the table with his fist. END
BEGIN NOW 19. END
BEGIN NOW SHIRLEY (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW I am a business leader and a END
BEGIN NOW community pillar and I don’t take END
BEGIN NOW courting advice from teenage boys! END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW Well this teenage boy is a END
BEGIN NOW quarterback and a prom king, so END
BEGIN NOW maybe you should! END
BEGIN NOW ANNIE END
BEGIN NOW You’re not prom king anymore, Troy, END
BEGIN NOW this isn’t Greendale High. END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW How did you know I went there? END
BEGIN NOW ANNIE END
BEGIN NOW Because you’re wearing your stupid END
BEGIN NOW letter jacket and more importantly END
BEGIN NOW I SAT BEHIND YOU IN ALGEBRA! END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW Wait, are you the girl that got END
BEGIN NOW hooked on pills and dropped out? END
BEGIN NOW You’re Little Annie Adderall! END
BEGIN NOW ANNIE END
BEGIN NOW And you’re a stupid jock that lost END
BEGIN NOW his scholarship because he END
BEGIN NOW celebrated getting it with a keg END
BEGIN NOW stand and dislocated both END
BEGIN NOW shoulders! END
BEGIN NOW ABED END
BEGIN NOW I’m ready! I’m ready! END
BEGIN NOW Everyone looks at Abed. END
BEGIN NOW ABED (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW I bought one of those big binders END
BEGIN NOW to store my DVDs in. And I left it END
BEGIN NOW in the sun, and the plastic sleeves END
BEGIN NOW melted to the discs, and they’re END
BEGIN NOW all unplayable and it’s my fault! END
BEGIN NOW Abed starts sobbing real tears. Everyone watches, confused. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW That’s your Breakfast Club doozy? END
BEGIN NOW ABED END
BEGIN NOW (through sobs) END
BEGIN NOW I love cinema! END
BEGIN NOW 20. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff’s phone rings. He answers. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Hello? END
BEGIN NOW A very low voice from the other end: END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN (V.O.) END
BEGIN NOW (on phone) END
BEGIN NOW It’s Professor Duncan. Come to the END
BEGIN NOW parking lot. Now. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW What’s wrong with your voice? END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN (V.O.) END
BEGIN NOW (on phone) END
BEGIN NOW I’m disguising it. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I’ll be right there. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff hangs up. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Now where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW It’s an emergency. You guys need END
BEGIN NOW to hash this stuff out anyway, END
BEGIN NOW because we can’t study with all END
BEGIN NOW this stuff seething under the END
BEGIN NOW surface. I just hope at least one END
BEGIN NOW of you is here when I get back. END
BEGIN NOW CUT TO: END
BEGIN NOW EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Jeff enters the parking lot, looking around. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN (O.S.) END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Jeff. END
BEGIN NOW Duncan emerges from between two cars, holding a large, thick END
BEGIN NOW envelope. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Every answer to every test in your END
BEGIN NOW curriculum this semester. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW You are the best. END
BEGIN NOW 21. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff reaches for the package. Duncan withholds it. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW But what do I get? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I thought we had a deal. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Deals are bound by ethics, Jeff. END
BEGIN NOW Deals are for five year old girls. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW What do you want. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Your Lexus. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW HA! My luxury sedan for a END
BEGIN NOW semester’s worth of answers? END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Come on, you’re never going to stop END
BEGIN NOW taking the easy way out. I’ll be END
BEGIN NOW helping you for four years. You END
BEGIN NOW want to get a degree while taking END
BEGIN NOW naps? I want leather seats with END
BEGIN NOW built-in ball warmers. Offer END
BEGIN NOW expires in ten seconds. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I’m supposed to do what, walk home? END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Take my Prius. END
BEGIN NOW Duncan holds up some keys. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW PRIUS? END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW It’s good for the Earth. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW So is wiping your butt with a leaf END
BEGIN NOW but it’s not how a man gets around! END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Time’s up. END
BEGIN NOW Duncan starts to walk away. Jeff panics. END
BEGIN NOW 22. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Alright! END
BEGIN NOW CUT TO: END
BEGIN NOW INT. LIBRARY END
BEGIN NOW Jeff heads across the library toward the study room, carrying END
BEGIN NOW Duncan’s packet. END
BEGIN NOW Britta opens the door and comes running to him. We can hear END
BEGIN NOW chaos coming from the room behind her. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW It’s really bad in there. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, sounds like a train wreck. END
BEGIN NOW What do you say? Time to go? END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Go? Jeff, I would rather flunk END
BEGIN NOW Spanish and starve to death than END
BEGIN NOW abandon a group of people in pain. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff stares at her for a beat, then: END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW You thought I meant time to go to END
BEGIN NOW dinner? I meant time to go give END
BEGIN NOW these people the healing they need. END
BEGIN NOW Time to spread the love, time to END
BEGIN NOW set everything back to exactly the END
BEGIN NOW way it was before they got here. END
BEGIN NOW She gives his arm one of those platonic but lingering touches END
BEGIN NOW that women have been using to secretly control civilization END
BEGIN NOW for 50,000 years. As she heads back to the room, Jeff adds END
BEGIN NOW carefully: END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Then dinner. END
BEGIN NOW FADE OUT. END
BEGIN NOW 23. END
BEGIN NOW ACT III END
BEGIN NOW FADE IN: END
BEGIN NOW INT. STUDY ROOM END
BEGIN NOW Jeff walks in. Everyone is sitting with their arms folded, END
BEGIN NOW staring at the table in front of them. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW How’s it going in here? END
BEGIN NOW Everyone explodes into furious name calling and arguing. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Alright, alright. Simmer down! I END
BEGIN NOW want to tell you something! END
BEGIN NOW They quiet down. He squares himself. Closing argument time. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW You know what makes humans END
BEGIN NOW different from other animals? We END
BEGIN NOW are the only species on Earth that END
BEGIN NOW observes Shark Week. Sharks don’t END
BEGIN NOW even have Shark Week, but we do. END
BEGIN NOW For the same reason I can pick up END
BEGIN NOW this pencil, tell you its name is END
BEGIN NOW Steve, then go like this END
BEGIN NOW (snaps pencil) END
BEGIN NOW And part of you dies just a little END
BEGIN NOW inside. Because humans can connect END
BEGIN NOW to anything. We can sympathize END
BEGIN NOW with a pencil, we can forgive a END
BEGIN NOW shark, we can give Ben Affleck an END
BEGIN NOW Academy Award for screenwriting. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone nods knowingly, touched. Britta, however, remains END
BEGIN NOW poker-faced. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW People can find the good in just END
BEGIN NOW about anything but themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Look at me. It’s obvious to all of END
BEGIN NOW you that I’m awesome, and yet, if I END
BEGIN NOW agreed with you, I would be an ass. END
BEGIN NOW But I can think Annie’s awesome in END
BEGIN NOW ways that I’m not. She’s driven. END
BEGIN NOW Some people have to be driven or END
BEGIN NOW the power goes off and the ice END
BEGIN NOW cream melts. And look at Pierce. END
BEGIN NOW 24. END
BEGIN NOW (MORE) END
BEGIN NOW Other guys his age are locked up in END
BEGIN NOW their houses yelling at the people END
BEGIN NOW on TV for farting, this guy is out END
BEGIN NOW here, with us, even though he’s END
BEGIN NOW earned the right to dismiss us. END
BEGIN NOW Just like Shirley’s earned a little END
BEGIN NOW elbow room, and a lot of respect, END
BEGIN NOW not as a wife, not as a mother, END
BEGIN NOW it’s time for her to be a woman, END
BEGIN NOW and don’t test her on that, because END
BEGIN NOW that thing about the jukebox was END
BEGIN NOW way too specific to be improvised, END
BEGIN NOW we want her on our side when we END
BEGIN NOW rumble with the other study groups. END
BEGIN NOW The group murmurs in enthusiastic agreement. Troy nods at END
BEGIN NOW Shirley. Shirley smiles. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW You want Troy, too. That’s why END
BEGIN NOW we’re tempted to dis the jacket, END
BEGIN NOW because it’s a symbol that END
BEGIN NOW intimidates us, you think END
BEGIN NOW astronauts go to the moon because END
BEGIN NOW they hate oxygen, come on, they’re END
BEGIN NOW trying to impress their high END
BEGIN NOW school’s prom king, and well they END
BEGIN NOW should, because I saw our track END
BEGIN NOW team tonight and I’m pretty sure END
BEGIN NOW Troy’s gonna be a big dog on END
BEGIN NOW campus. And Abed. You know, God END
BEGIN NOW made people with minds that wander END
BEGIN NOW because the answers we need are END
BEGIN NOW barely ever the ones we’re asking. END
BEGIN NOW Abed’s a shaman, ask him to pass END
BEGIN NOW the salt, you get a bowl of soup, END
BEGIN NOW and guess what, soup is better. END
BEGIN NOW Abed is better. END
BEGIN NOW (beat) END
BEGIN NOW You’re all better than you think END
BEGIN NOW you are. You’re just not designed END
BEGIN NOW to believe it when you hear it from END
BEGIN NOW yourself. So everybody, do me a END
BEGIN NOW favor, look to the person on the END
BEGIN NOW left. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody does it. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW I want you to extend to that person END
BEGIN NOW the same compassion you extend to END
BEGIN NOW sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck. I END
BEGIN NOW want you to say to that person, “I END
BEGIN NOW forgive you.” Go ahead. END
BEGIN NOW 25. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Everyone says “I forgive you.” END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Now look at me. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone looks at Jeff. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW You just stopped being a study END
BEGIN NOW group. You have now become END
BEGIN NOW something unstoppable. I hereby END
BEGIN NOW pronounce you a community. END
BEGIN NOW Abed wipes at some tears. END
BEGIN NOW ABED END
BEGIN NOW It’s not like Breakfast Club END
BEGIN NOW anymore. Now it’s like Stripes, or END
BEGIN NOW Meatballs. Anything with Bill END
BEGIN NOW Murray, really. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I agree with Abed that tonight has END
BEGIN NOW been very special. Too special for END
BEGIN NOW Spanish, really, and I think that, END
BEGIN NOW like the Breakfast Club, we ought END
BEGIN NOW to disband and reflect. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff looks at Britta and nods his head slightly toward the END
BEGIN NOW door, like, “let’s go.” END
BEGIN NOW Britta looks at Jeff. She looks around the room at all the END
BEGIN NOW mesmerized faces. Finally, she announces her decision while END
BEGIN NOW watching Jeff carefully. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Actually, now that we’re END
BEGIN NOW unstoppable, it’ll probably take no END
BEGIN NOW time at all to prepare for this END
BEGIN NOW quiz, right? END
BEGIN NOW Everyone agrees with that. They’re very excited about END
BEGIN NOW studying, now. Jeff goes to plan C. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I have a surprise for you guys. We END
BEGIN NOW don’t need to study. I have all END
BEGIN NOW the tests and answers for the END
BEGIN NOW semester. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff shows the packet he got from Duncan. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW So. All done. END
BEGIN NOW 26. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone at the table is a bit taken aback. Britta narrows END
BEGIN NOW her eyes on him. Pierce puzzles through this. END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW Well, Jeff, now, why in Hell’s END
BEGIN NOW Bells would you want to enroll in a END
BEGIN NOW community college to cheat? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t want to enroll here, END
BEGIN NOW Pierce, I have to be here. I’m a END
BEGIN NOW lawyer. I mean, I was a lawyer, END
BEGIN NOW and I’d like to get back to being END
BEGIN NOW one as soon as possible. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW (gross) END
BEGIN NOW A lawyer... END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW Then why have a study group? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I DON’T HAVE A STUDY GROUP! YOU END
BEGIN NOW PEOPLE JUST SHOWED UP! END
BEGIN NOW Britta explains something to everyone she’d been putting END
BEGIN NOW together for a while. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW It was all to get in my pants. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Why can’t you see that for the END
BEGIN NOW compliment that it is? END
BEGIN NOW ANNIE END
BEGIN NOW What about the look left speech? END
BEGIN NOW Was that real? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I learned it at tennis camp when I END
BEGIN NOW was seven. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone is dismayed and disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW I added the Ben Affleck references! END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Jeff, you had me at “I’m a lawyer,” END
BEGIN NOW and by had me, I mean had me ready END
BEGIN NOW to puke. Now please leave and let END
BEGIN NOW us study before my gag reflex hits END
BEGIN NOW a tipping point. END
BEGIN NOW 27. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW But you’re not listening, I have END
BEGIN NOW the answers. END
BEGIN NOW Britta physically gags. END
BEGIN NOW Abed shakes his head. END
BEGIN NOW ABED END
BEGIN NOW I thought you were like Bill Murray END
BEGIN NOW in any of his films. But you’re END
BEGIN NOW really like Michael Douglas in any END
BEGIN NOW of his. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, well, you have Asperger’s. END
BEGIN NOW As Jeff exits, everyone recoils in shock and comforts a END
BEGIN NOW confused Abed. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW He is not qualified to make that END
BEGIN NOW diagnosis. END
BEGIN NOW CUT TO: END
BEGIN NOW EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Jeff exits the front doors, miffed, sour grapey, opening END
BEGIN NOW Duncan’s packet. END
BEGIN NOW He gets the envelope open and pulls out a stack of papers END
BEGIN NOW from inside. He looks at them, stunned. END
BEGIN NOW We watch as Jeff flips through a stack of pages from old END
BEGIN NOW Psychology Today magazines. END
BEGIN NOW CUT TO: END
BEGIN NOW INT. DUNCAN’S OFFICE END
BEGIN NOW Professor Duncan is enjoying a pipe in his office and seems END
BEGIN NOW to have been expecting Jeff to burst through the door, which END
BEGIN NOW Jeff now does. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Before you react, you’ll want to END
BEGIN NOW think about the gift you’ve been END
BEGIN NOW given. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW An excuse to punch a hippy? END
BEGIN NOW 28. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW A second chance at an honest life. END
BEGIN NOW A life that starts here at END
BEGIN NOW Greendale. All these tricks you END
BEGIN NOW acquired to survive out there, they END
BEGIN NOW have no use in this place that END
BEGIN NOW you’re wiping your feet on. People END
BEGIN NOW here are excited and proud to be END
BEGIN NOW here, students and faculty alike. END
BEGIN NOW And frankly, we’re a little END
BEGIN NOW offended by the implication that END
BEGIN NOW there’s anywhere else we’d like to END
BEGIN NOW be. This is a lesson you need to END
BEGIN NOW learn, Jeff. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff shrugs. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Well, I’m...I’m sorry, but I’m not END
BEGIN NOW getting it. END
BEGIN NOW DUNCAN END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you’re incapable of learning. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Is it possible you’re incapable of END
BEGIN NOW teaching? It is community college. END
BEGIN NOW Now give me my keys or it’s going END
BEGIN NOW to get sloppy. END
BEGIN NOW DISSOLVE TO: END
BEGIN NOW EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW Jeff stomps across the empty night time campus of Greendale END
BEGIN NOW community college. So fucked. END
BEGIN NOW He sees the Old Black Woman sitting on one of the benches END
BEGIN NOW that is just outside the library entrance. He starts walking END
BEGIN NOW to her. She’s clearly bummed out about this. He stands by END
BEGIN NOW her for a moment, mustering the confession: END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know how to do it. END
BEGIN NOW OLD BLACK WOMAN END
BEGIN NOW I don’t care. END
BEGIN NOW She gets up. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW OLD BLACK WOMAN END
BEGIN NOW (sarcastic) END
BEGIN NOW Don’t you know, honey child? END
BEGIN NOW 29. END
BEGIN NOW (MORE) END
BEGIN NOW I gots to go polish that moon and END
BEGIN NOW hang them clouds out to dry. But END
BEGIN NOW don’t you worry. Outer space Jesus END
BEGIN NOW negro lady is watching over you. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff slumps down on the bench as she walks away. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Great. Even God thinks I’m a dick. END
BEGIN NOW He sits there for a moment. Puts his head back. END
BEGIN NOW Pierce emerges from the library’s front doors, sees Jeff, and END
BEGIN NOW pauses to take in the night air. END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW Boy. There is Autumn, and then END
BEGIN NOW there is just Fall. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW You may have purchased a knockoff END
BEGIN NOW calendar. END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW You said some nice things about me END
BEGIN NOW up there, Jeffrey. END
BEGIN NOW Pierce sits on another bench across from him. END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW And I do admit, I’ve got things to END
BEGIN NOW learn about the ladies. You know END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been married seven times? I’m END
BEGIN NOW starting to think I’m doing END
BEGIN NOW something wrong. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Do I look like I’m in a position to END
BEGIN NOW give romantic advice right now? END
BEGIN NOW Troy comes out of the library, sees them both and nods. END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW Hey. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I thought you guys were studying. END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW We’re done. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Oh. That was fast. END
BEGIN NOW Troy sits next to him, curious. END
BEGIN NOW 30. END
BEGIN NOW OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D) END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW Let me ask you something. People END
BEGIN NOW have been clowning me about this END
BEGIN NOW jacket since I got here. But if I END
BEGIN NOW take it off to make them happy, I’m END
BEGIN NOW weak, right? END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW (shrug) END
BEGIN NOW Troy, what’s it matter. You lose END
BEGIN NOW the jacket to please them, you keep END
BEGIN NOW it to piss them off...either way, END
BEGIN NOW it’s for them, that’s what’s weak. END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW (epiphany) END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. END
BEGIN NOW (bigger epiphany) END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. END
BEGIN NOW (confusion) END
BEGIN NOW Wait, but - END
BEGIN NOW (realization) END
BEGIN NOW Whoa! END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW He’s good, isn’t he? END
BEGIN NOW TROY END
BEGIN NOW My brain’s all wrinkly. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff doesn’t necessarily mind the praise, but he’s still got END
BEGIN NOW wallowing to do. END
BEGIN NOW Shirley and Annie come through the doors together. Annie END
BEGIN NOW stops when she sees the boys sitting together. END
BEGIN NOW ANNIE END
BEGIN NOW Is this another “we hate Annie” END
BEGIN NOW meeting? END
BEGIN NOW SHIRLEY END
BEGIN NOW Oh, sweetie. Nobody hates you. END
BEGIN NOW (catching it) END
BEGIN NOW Sorry I called you sweetie, it’s a END
BEGIN NOW mother’s habit - END
BEGIN NOW ANNIE END
BEGIN NOW (almost crying) END
BEGIN NOW My parents, um - END
BEGIN NOW (clears throat) END
BEGIN NOW This is interesting architecture. END
BEGIN NOW Abed and Britta come through the library doors. END
BEGIN NOW 31. END
BEGIN NOW ABED END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hey, everybody. END
BEGIN NOW Britta is not excited to see Jeff. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Shouldn’t you be at home rolling END
BEGIN NOW around on a bed covered with quiz END
BEGIN NOW answers? END
BEGIN NOW Jeff tosses the envelope to her. She looks at the contents. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Ha! Live by the sword, huh Amigo? END
BEGIN NOW (explaining) END
BEGIN NOW Amigo means “friend.” You might END
BEGIN NOW need to know that for tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff nods, resigned to his fate. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I want to say something. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff starts to say something. Then stops. He gets a weird END
BEGIN NOW look on his face. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW But nothing I say is true, so...I END
BEGIN NOW can’t... END
BEGIN NOW He struggles. Then, finally: END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW Sorry. I need help. END
BEGIN NOW He buries his face in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF (CONT’D) END
BEGIN NOW I’m gonna flunk. I need help. END
BEGIN NOW The group looks around at each other. Mostly, they’re all END
BEGIN NOW looking at Britta. END
BEGIN NOW Shirley looks at Britta with a face that says “do something.” END
BEGIN NOW Britta looks at Shirley with a “What? Me?” face. She END
BEGIN NOW indicates Jeff and makes a gagging gesture. END
BEGIN NOW Shirley makes a gesture that means “give me a break and maybe END
BEGIN NOW also get over yourself because there are worse things in the END
BEGIN NOW world than men making asses of themselves over you.” END
BEGIN NOW Troy gestures insistently. So does Pierce. Abed is END
BEGIN NOW confused. END
BEGIN NOW 32. END
BEGIN NOW ABED END
BEGIN NOW What’s going on? Can you guys hear END
BEGIN NOW me? Am I deaf? END
BEGIN NOW Jeff looks up, curious to see what Abed is talking about. END
BEGIN NOW Britta makes a decision. She addresses the group. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Hey, um. We should, um. END
BEGIN NOW (clears throat) END
BEGIN NOW We should get back upstairs, and END
BEGIN NOW finish, right? END
BEGIN NOW Jeff is confused. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW I thought you were done. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Who said that? Are we done? END
BEGIN NOW PIERCE END
BEGIN NOW I’m not done. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone agrees they’re not done. Abed is more confused. END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Well, let’s go. Jeff, you coming? END
BEGIN NOW Jeff is taken aback by the offer. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW Are you serious? I can study with END
BEGIN NOW you guys? END
BEGIN NOW BRITTA END
BEGIN NOW Eh. You know. If you want. I END
BEGIN NOW don’t care. END
BEGIN NOW Jeff stands up, recovering from his depression. END
BEGIN NOW JEFF END
BEGIN NOW That’s the nicest thing anyone’s END
BEGIN NOW ever said to me. END
BEGIN NOW The group heads back for the library entrance as we pull back END
BEGIN NOW in a crane shot that, like this campus, packs a lot of END
BEGIN NOW emotional punch for a reasonable price. END
