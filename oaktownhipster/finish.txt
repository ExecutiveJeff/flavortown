BEGIN NOW What should I make of this?. END
BEGIN NOW I'm trapped inside a terminal. END

BEGIN NOW I dreamt about you nearly every night this week. END
BEGIN NOW How many secrets can you keep?. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat. END
BEGIN NOW Until I fall asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Spilling drinks on my settee. END

BEGIN NOW If this feeling flows both ways?. END
BEGIN NOW (Sad to see you go). END

BEGIN NOW Simmer down and pucker up. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know if you feel the same as I do. END

BEGIN NOW Arabella's got some interstellagator skin boots. END
BEGIN NOW And a helter skelter around her little finger and I ride it endlessly. END
BEGIN NOW She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit. END
BEGIN NOW And when she needs a shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams. END
BEGIN NOW My days end best when this sunset gets itself. END
BEGIN NOW Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side. END
BEGIN NOW It's much less picturesque without her catching the light. END
BEGIN NOW The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes. END
BEGIN NOW As Arabella, oh. END
BEGIN NOW As Arabella. END
BEGIN NOW Just might have tapped into your mind and soul. END
BEGIN NOW You can't be sure. END
BEGIN NOW Arabella's got a 70s head. END
BEGIN NOW But she's a modern lover. END
BEGIN NOW It's an exploration, she's made of outer space. END
BEGIN NOW And her lips are like the galaxy's edge. END
BEGIN NOW And a kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place. END
BEGIN NOW My days end best when this sunset gets itself. END
BEGIN NOW Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side. END
BEGIN NOW It's much less picturesque without her catching the light. END
BEGIN NOW The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes. END
BEGIN NOW As Arabella, oh. END
BEGIN NOW As Arabella. END
BEGIN NOW Just might have tapped into your mind and soul. END
BEGIN NOW You can't be sure. END
BEGIN NOW That's magic in a cheetah print coat. END
BEGIN NOW Just a slip underneath it I hope. END
BEGIN NOW Asking if I can have one of those. END
BEGIN NOW Organic cigarettes that she smokes. END
BEGIN NOW Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke. END
BEGIN NOW Makes you wish that you were the bottle. END
BEGIN NOW Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like.... END
BEGIN NOW Just might have tapped into your mind and soul. END
BEGIN NOW You can't be sure. END
BEGIN NOW Blind faith. END
BEGIN NOW Heartache. END

BEGIN NOW Mistakes. END
BEGIN NOW My sweet fireball. END

BEGIN NOW Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke. END
BEGIN NOW Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road. END
BEGIN NOW Leave me listening to the stones. END
BEGIN NOW 2000 light years from home. END
BEGIN NOW So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not. END
BEGIN NOW Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna. END
BEGIN NOW Never knowing when to stop. END
BEGIN NOW Sunglasses indoors, par for the course. END
BEGIN NOW Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls. END
BEGIN NOW Cages and poles. END
BEGIN NOW Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again. END
BEGIN NOW She's having a sly indoor smoke. END
BEGIN NOW She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends. END
BEGIN NOW Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes. END
BEGIN NOW As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach. END
BEGIN NOW And it seems as though those lumps in your throat. END
BEGIN NOW That you just swallowed have got you going. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, come on, come on. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, come on, come on. END
BEGIN NOW Number one party anthem. END
BEGIN NOW She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't. END
BEGIN NOW May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her. END
BEGIN NOW Just to get the ball to roll. END
BEGIN NOW Drunken monologues, confused because. END
BEGIN NOW It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good. END
BEGIN NOW And you look like you could. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, come on, come on. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, come on, come on. END
BEGIN NOW Number one party anthem. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, come on, come on. END
BEGIN NOW Before the moment's gone. END
BEGIN NOW Number one party anthem. END

BEGIN NOW And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time. END
BEGIN NOW There's all these secrets that I can't keep. END
BEGIN NOW Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,. END
BEGIN NOW It's kinda strange now you're gone. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found. END
BEGIN NOW Has it gone for good?. END

BEGIN NOW Tells me it's home time. END
BEGIN NOW But I'm not finished. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause you're not by my side. END
BEGIN NOW And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving. END
BEGIN NOW Carrying your shoes. END
BEGIN NOW Decided that once again I was just dreaming. END

BEGIN NOW And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor. END
BEGIN NOW As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for. END
BEGIN NOW And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you. END

BEGIN NOW Will wait until the point when you let go. END
BEGIN NOW Two... One, two, three, four.... END
BEGIN NOW The only girl I've ever loved. END

BEGIN NOW Of the life we used to love. END
BEGIN NOW Just to keep ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW At least enough to carry on. END

BEGIN NOW And here is the room where your brothers were born. END
BEGIN NOW Indentions in the sheets. END
BEGIN NOW Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore. END
BEGIN NOW And it's so sad to see the world agree. END
BEGIN NOW That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies. END

BEGIN NOW I wish you hadn't stayed. END
BEGIN NOW My vision's clearer now, but I'm unafraid. END
BEGIN NOW Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze. END

BEGIN NOW And go. END
BEGIN NOW In your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW See I am. END
BEGIN NOW Stop. END
BEGIN NOW And go. END
BEGIN NOW In your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW When I saw her for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW Lips moved as her eyes closed. END
BEGIN NOW Heard something in his voice. END
BEGIN NOW "And I'll be there", he says. END
BEGIN NOW Then he walks out. END
BEGIN NOW Somehow he was trying. END
BEGIN NOW Too hard to be like them. END
BEGIN NOW Well I am. END
BEGIN NOW Stop. END
BEGIN NOW And go. END
BEGIN NOW In your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW And I am. END
BEGIN NOW Stop. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, darling, let me go. END
BEGIN NOW Tried it once and they like it. END
BEGIN NOW Then tried to hide it. END
BEGIN NOW Says, "I've been doing this 25 years". END
BEGIN NOW But I'm not listening no more. END
BEGIN NOW And these friends, they keep asking for more. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, but that's it. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't take no shortcuts. END
BEGIN NOW I spent the money that I saved up. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Momma running out of luck. END
BEGIN NOW Like my sister, don't give a fuck. END
BEGIN NOW I wanna steal your innocence. END
BEGIN NOW To me, my life, it don't make sense. END
BEGIN NOW Those strange manners, I loved 'em so. END
BEGIN NOW "Why won't you wear your new trench coat?". END
BEGIN NOW I should've worked much harder. END
BEGIN NOW I should've just not bothered. END
BEGIN NOW I never show up on weekdays. END
BEGIN NOW Something that you learned yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW "Drive you to work; you'll be on time. END
BEGIN NOW These little problems they're not yours and mine,". END
BEGIN NOW "Come on and listen to what I say. END
BEGIN NOW I've got some secrets that'll make you stay". END
BEGIN NOW I just want to turn you down. END
BEGIN NOW I just want to turn you around. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you ain't never had nothin' I wanted, but.... END
BEGIN NOW I want it all. END
BEGIN NOW I just can't figure out.... END
BEGIN NOW Nothing. END
BEGIN NOW And all together it went well. END
BEGIN NOW We made pretend we were best friends. END
BEGIN NOW Then she said, "Oh, you're a freak". END
BEGIN NOW "They ordered me to make mistakes". END
BEGIN NOW Together again, like the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW It all works somehow in the end. END
BEGIN NOW The things we did, the things you hide. END
BEGIN NOW For the record it's between you and I. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts. END
BEGIN NOW I spent the money that I saved up. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Momma running out of luck. END
BEGIN NOW Like my sister, don't give a fuck. END
BEGIN NOW I wanna steal your innocence. END
BEGIN NOW To me my life, it just don't make any sense. END
BEGIN NOW Those strange manners, I loved 'em so. END
BEGIN NOW "Why won't you wear your new trench coat?". END
BEGIN NOW I just want to misbehave. END
BEGIN NOW I just want to be your slave. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but.... END
BEGIN NOW I want it all. END
BEGIN NOW I just can't figure out.... END
BEGIN NOW Nothin'. END
BEGIN NOW And all together it went well. END
BEGIN NOW We made pretend we were best friends. END
BEGIN NOW Then she said, "Oh, I can wait". END
BEGIN NOW They ordered me to make mistakes. END
BEGIN NOW Together again like the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW It all works somehow in the end. END
BEGIN NOW The things we did, the things you hide. END
BEGIN NOW And for the record, it's between you and I. END
BEGIN NOW In many ways, they'll miss the good old days. END
BEGIN NOW Someday, someday. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW When we was young, oh man, did we have fun. END
BEGIN NOW Always, always. END
BEGIN NOW Promises, they break before they're made. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth. END

BEGIN NOW Darlin', your head's not right. END
BEGIN NOW See, alone we stand, together we fall apart. END

BEGIN NOW No, I ain't wastin' no more time. END
BEGIN NOW And now my fears. END
BEGIN NOW They come to me in threes. END
BEGIN NOW So, I. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW Say, "Fate my friend,. END
BEGIN NOW You say the strangest things. END
BEGIN NOW I find, sometimes". END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth. END
BEGIN NOW Say I will try my best. END
BEGIN NOW You say you wanna stay by my side. END

BEGIN NOW I ain't wasting no more time. END
BEGIN NOW No choice now, it's too late. END
BEGIN NOW Let him go, he gave up. END
BEGIN NOW I gave up. END
BEGIN NOW Lisa says, "Take time for me". END
BEGIN NOW Dropping him down to his knees. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, chest down.... END
BEGIN NOW Take me away. END
BEGIN NOW See I've got to explain. END
BEGIN NOW Things, they have changed. END
BEGIN NOW In such a permanent way. END
BEGIN NOW Life seems unreal. END
BEGIN NOW Can we go back to your place?. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, "You drink too much". END
BEGIN NOW Makes me drink just the same. END
BEGIN NOW People tried. Felt so right. END
BEGIN NOW Giving themselves good advice. END
BEGIN NOW Looking down sometimes felt nice.... END

BEGIN NOW We all like it a little different.. END
BEGIN NOW Last night she said,. END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, baby, I feel so down.. END

BEGIN NOW I'm walkin' out that door.". END
BEGIN NOW Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now. END

BEGIN NOW Says we're all the same. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I don't see it that way. END

BEGIN NOW Trying to remind her. END
BEGIN NOW When we go back. END
BEGIN NOW I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train. END
BEGIN NOW I try but you see, it's hard to explain. END
BEGIN NOW I say the right things, but act the wrong way. END
BEGIN NOW I like it right here, but I cannot stay. END
BEGIN NOW I watch the TV; forget what I'm told. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I am too young, and they are too old. END
BEGIN NOW The joke is on you, this place is a zoo. END

BEGIN NOW Oh, man, can't you see I'm nervous, so please. END
BEGIN NOW Pretend to be nice, so I can be mean. END
BEGIN NOW I miss the last bus, we take the next train. END
BEGIN NOW I try but you see, it's hard to explain. END
BEGIN NOW Won't decide, but he won't debate. END
BEGIN NOW Said, "Thanks my friend," but he was too late. END
BEGIN NOW Oh why, oh why. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW So you think things move pretty fast down here. END
BEGIN NOW Well just wait my dear 'till you look up there. END
BEGIN NOW Oh maybe someday you'll know. END
BEGIN NOW Had his second kid, was an early night. END
BEGIN NOW Got to be well dressed 'cause he hates to fly. END

BEGIN NOW Instead of anywhere with you. END
BEGIN NOW But, to me, it's all the same. END
BEGIN NOW And I lost my page. Again. END
BEGIN NOW I know this is surreal. END
BEGIN NOW But, I'll try my luck with you. END
BEGIN NOW This life is on my side. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I am your one?. END
BEGIN NOW "Believe me, this is a chance," oh oh. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see what's for sale. END

BEGIN NOW Oh, it's never gonna be. END
BEGIN NOW It's sad, but I agree. END
BEGIN NOW The signals don't seem right. END
BEGIN NOW They last for just one night, and then. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry that I said:. END
BEGIN NOW "That we were just good friends". END
BEGIN NOW No harm, he's armed. END
BEGIN NOW Setting off all your alarms. END
BEGIN NOW They're trapped. END

BEGIN NOW Home - home in the late-night. END
BEGIN NOW And away - away in the half-life. END
BEGIN NOW Except saturday - crushed by the boring. END
BEGIN NOW Until played and plagued by the tourists again. END
BEGIN NOW When once you had believed it. END
BEGIN NOW Now you see it's sucking you in. END
BEGIN NOW To string you along with the pretense. END
BEGIN NOW And pave the way for the coming release. END
BEGIN NOW Alone and prone in the half-light. END
BEGIN NOW And late- late to the real-life. END
BEGIN NOW If you will find a way into the gold rush. END
BEGIN NOW You will stay until the morning comes. END
BEGIN NOW You will normalize. END
BEGIN NOW Don't it make you feel alive. END
BEGIN NOW Its time to get away, its time to get away from you. END
BEGIN NOW Its time to get away, its time to get away from you. END
BEGIN NOW You brought a lot of money. END
BEGIN NOW But me, I got a tiny tummy. END
BEGIN NOW And you, you make me sleep. END
BEGIN NOW I try and try. END
BEGIN NOW But you're under my knee. END
BEGIN NOW And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean). END
BEGIN NOW And so its time to get away, Its time to get away from you. END
BEGIN NOW I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away. END
BEGIN NOW Next time we'll talk it over. END
BEGIN NOW And we can start again. END
BEGIN NOW For you, I caught a lot of static. END

BEGIN NOW Ah-what what what what what did you think would happen next?. END
BEGIN NOW Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?. END
BEGIN NOW Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you. END
BEGIN NOW I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away. END
BEGIN NOW Next time let's talk about it. END
BEGIN NOW And maybe start again. END
BEGIN NOW To think I used to pity you. END

BEGIN NOW To think I used to pity you. END
BEGIN NOW To think I used to talk to you, it's true. END
BEGIN NOW Next time we can talk about it. END
BEGIN NOW Or even start again. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't tell you what you wanted. END
BEGIN NOW (You know what I'm saying?) I knew you were low man,. END
BEGIN NOW But the truth is I was shocked. END
BEGIN NOW (Of) power eyes, eyes never lie. END

BEGIN NOW But if we act all shy, it'll make it ok. END
BEGIN NOW Makes it go away.. END
BEGIN NOW Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin. END

BEGIN NOW I wish that we could talk about it,. END
BEGIN NOW But there, that's the problem.. END
BEGIN NOW With someone new I couldn't start it,. END
BEGIN NOW Too late, for beginnings.. END
BEGIN NOW The little things that made me nervous,. END
BEGIN NOW Are gone, in a moment.. END
BEGIN NOW I miss the way we used to argue,. END
BEGIN NOW Locked, in your basement.. END
BEGIN NOW I wake up and the phone is ringing,. END
BEGIN NOW Surprised, as it's early.. END
BEGIN NOW And that should be the perfect warning,. END
BEGIN NOW That something's, a problem.. END
BEGIN NOW To tell the truth I saw it coming,. END
BEGIN NOW The way, you were breathing.. END
BEGIN NOW But nothing can prepare you for it,. END
BEGIN NOW The voice, on the other, end.. END
BEGIN NOW The worst is all the lovely weather,. END
BEGIN NOW I'm stunned, it's not raining.. END
BEGIN NOW The coffee isn't even bitter,. END
BEGIN NOW Because, what's the difference?. END
BEGIN NOW There's all the work that needs to be done,. END
BEGIN NOW It's late, for revision.. END
BEGIN NOW There's all the time and all the planning,. END
BEGIN NOW And songs, to be finished.. END
BEGIN NOW And it keeps coming,. END
BEGIN NOW And it keeps coming,. END
BEGIN NOW And it keeps coming,. END
BEGIN NOW Till the day it stops. END
BEGIN NOW And it keeps coming,. END
BEGIN NOW Till the day it stops.. END
BEGIN NOW I wish that we could talk about it,. END

BEGIN NOW You're smaller than my wife imagined,. END

BEGIN NOW There shouldn't be this ring of silence,. END
BEGIN NOW But what, are the options?. END
BEGIN NOW When someone great is gone.. END
BEGIN NOW We're safe, for the moment.. END
BEGIN NOW Saved,. END
BEGIN NOW For the moment.. END
BEGIN NOW That's how it starts. END
BEGIN NOW We go back to your house. END
BEGIN NOW We check the charts. END
BEGIN NOW And start to figure it out. END
BEGIN NOW And if it's crowded, all the better. END
BEGIN NOW Because we know we're gonna be up late. END
BEGIN NOW But if you're worried about the weather. END
BEGIN NOW Then you picked the wrong place to stay. END
BEGIN NOW That's how it starts. END
BEGIN NOW And so it starts. END
BEGIN NOW You switch the engine on. END
BEGIN NOW We set controls for the heart of the sun. END
BEGIN NOW One of the ways we show our age. END
BEGIN NOW And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up. END
BEGIN NOW And I still don't wanna stagger home. END
BEGIN NOW Then it's the memory of our betters. END
BEGIN NOW That are keeping us on our feet. END
BEGIN NOW You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan. END
BEGIN NOW And the next five years trying to be with your friends again. END
BEGIN NOW You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can. END
BEGIN NOW Teah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend. END
BEGIN NOW It comes apart. END
BEGIN NOW The way it does in bad films. END
BEGIN NOW Except in parts. END
BEGIN NOW When the moral kicks in. END
BEGIN NOW Though when we're running out of the drugs. END
BEGIN NOW And the conversation's winding away. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't trade one stupid decision. END
BEGIN NOW For another five years of life. END
BEGIN NOW You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can. END
BEGIN NOW And the next ten people who are trying to be polite. END
BEGIN NOW When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?. END
BEGIN NOW And to tell the truth. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, this could be the last time. END
BEGIN NOW So here we go. END
BEGIN NOW Like a sales force into the night. END
BEGIN NOW And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool. END
BEGIN NOW On the road, there's always this. END
BEGIN NOW And if I'm sewn into submission. END
BEGIN NOW I can still come home to this. END
BEGIN NOW And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand. END
BEGIN NOW You can sleep on the plane or review what you said. END
BEGIN NOW When you're drunk and the kids leave impossible tasks. END
BEGIN NOW You think over and over, "hey, I'm finally dead.". END
BEGIN NOW Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand. END
BEGIN NOW Tou look contorted on yourself your ridiculous prop. END
BEGIN NOW You forgot what you meant when you read what you said. END
BEGIN NOW And you always knew you were tired, but then. END
BEGIN NOW Where are your friends tonight?. END
BEGIN NOW Where are your friends tonight?. END
BEGIN NOW Where are your friends tonight?. END
BEGIN NOW If I could see all my friends tonight. END
BEGIN NOW If I could see all my friends tonight. END
BEGIN NOW If I could see all my friends tonight. END
BEGIN NOW If I could see all my friends tonight. END

BEGIN NOW But still you pick up the phone. END
BEGIN NOW But hey man, you can take it. END
BEGIN NOW As long as they don't shove you out in the cold. END
BEGIN NOW It's not getting better, no it's not getting better, man. END
BEGIN NOW It's just getting old. END
BEGIN NOW Ah ooh! we do what we're programmed to do--. END
BEGIN NOW Hey we do what we're told. END
BEGIN NOW I never remember to carry my book when I get on the bus. END
BEGIN NOW You never forget it's your time to collect. END
BEGIN NOW When they are making a fuss. END
BEGIN NOW We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips. END
BEGIN NOW We're all high high high, high high on wiggling hips. END
BEGIN NOW Ah ooh! you break off your plans for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW And ah oh! you can tell them the dates. END
BEGIN NOW But that don't mean they're letting you go. END
BEGIN NOW Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW And you stay for the year. END
BEGIN NOW Avoid all the plans cuz we're making our day jobs. END
BEGIN NOW Into a steady career. END
BEGIN NOW We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips. END
BEGIN NOW We all claw claw claw, cli-climb-on to sinking ships. END
BEGIN NOW And ah ooh! avoid all the cold sideways glances. END
BEGIN NOW And ah ooh! celebrate! celebrate! celebrate!. END
BEGIN NOW And then turn to stone. END
BEGIN NOW Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes. END
BEGIN NOW You turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes. END
BEGIN NOW C'mon. END
BEGIN NOW Hey the rock writer told me to tell you:. END
BEGIN NOW "though you're great and you're brave. END
BEGIN NOW You still lack that which makes you a star.". END
BEGIN NOW Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes. END
BEGIN NOW We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes. END
BEGIN NOW Ow!. END
BEGIN NOW Sound of silver talk to me. END
BEGIN NOW Makes you want to feel like a teenager. END
BEGIN NOW Until you remember the feelings of. END
BEGIN NOW A real life emotional teenager. END
BEGIN NOW Then you think again. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're bringing me down. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're bringing me down. END
BEGIN NOW Like a rat in a cage. END
BEGIN NOW Pulling minimum wage. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're bringing me down. END
BEGIN NOW New York, you're safer. END
BEGIN NOW And you're wasting my time. END
BEGIN NOW Our records all show. END
BEGIN NOW You are filthy but fine. END
BEGIN NOW But they shuttered your stores. END
BEGIN NOW When you opened the doors. END
BEGIN NOW To the cops who were bored. END
BEGIN NOW Once they'd run out of crime. END
BEGIN NOW New York, you're perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Don't please don't change a thing. END
BEGIN NOW Your mild billionaire mayor's. END
BEGIN NOW Now convinced he's a king. END
BEGIN NOW So the boring collect. END
BEGIN NOW I mean all disrespect. END
BEGIN NOW In the neighborhood bars. END
BEGIN NOW I'd once dreamed I would drink. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're freaking me out. END
BEGIN NOW There's a ton of the twist. END
BEGIN NOW But we're fresh out of shout. END
BEGIN NOW Like a death in the hall. END
BEGIN NOW That you hear through your wall. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're freaking me out. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're bringing me down. END
BEGIN NOW New York, I Love You. END
BEGIN NOW But you're bringing me down. END
BEGIN NOW Like a death of the heart. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, where do I start?. END
BEGIN NOW But you're still the one pool. END
BEGIN NOW Where I'd happily drown. END
BEGIN NOW And oh.. Take me off your mailing list. END
BEGIN NOW For kids that think it still exists. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, for those who think it still exists. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I'm wrong. END
BEGIN NOW And maybe you're right. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I'm wrong. END
BEGIN NOW And maybe you're right. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you're right. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I'm wrong. END
BEGIN NOW And just maybe you're right. END
BEGIN NOW And Oh... END
BEGIN NOW Maybe mother told you true. END
BEGIN NOW And they're always be something there for you. END
BEGIN NOW And you'll never be alone. END
BEGIN NOW But maybe she's wrong. END
BEGIN NOW And maybe I'm right. END
BEGIN NOW And just maybe she's wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe she's wrong. END
BEGIN NOW And maybe I'm right. END
BEGIN NOW And if so, is there?. END
BEGIN NOW You turn on a spindle.. END
BEGIN NOW You're so much looser now but you're not explaining how you gained such new repose.. END
BEGIN NOW I touch the clasp of your locket, with its picture held,. END
BEGIN NOW Some secret you wouldn't tell but let it choke your neck.. END
BEGIN NOW So we imagine a darkness where all shapes divide,. END
BEGIN NOW Solids changing into light, with a burst of heat so bright.. END
BEGIN NOW Well fine, don't you do what I want you to.. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, don't degrade yourself the way that I do. END
BEGIN NOW Cause you don't depend upon all the shit that I use to make my moods improve.. END
BEGIN NOW Near a sea of pianos, there were waves of chords. END
BEGIN NOW That crashed against the shore in one huge and useless roar.. END
BEGIN NOW And there were girls bringing water,. END
BEGIN NOW Like a dream they came to cure the fever of my brain,. END
BEGIN NOW And soothe my burning throat.. END
BEGIN NOW And they made me a necklace, hanging beads of sweat on a string of my regrets,. END
BEGIN NOW And placed it round my neck. END
BEGIN NOW And they were singing, don't you do what you've wanted to.. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, don't destroy yourself like those cowards do. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the sun keeps coming up cause it's gotten used to you. END
BEGIN NOW And your constant need for proof.. END
BEGIN NOW Here is a scale. Weigh it out and you'll find, easily,. END
BEGIN NOW More than sufficient doubt that these colors, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Were picked in advance by some careful hand. END
BEGIN NOW With an absolute concept of beauty.. END
BEGIN NOW They are smeared and these blurs come in random order. END
BEGIN NOW And they color the eyes of your former lovers.. END
BEGIN NOW Hers were green like July,. END
BEGIN NOW Except when she cried they were red.. END
BEGIN NOW Now I know a disease that these doctors can't treat.. END
BEGIN NOW You contract on the day you accept all you see. END
BEGIN NOW Is a mirror and a mirror is all it can be.. END
BEGIN NOW A reflection of something we're missing.. END
BEGIN NOW And language just happened. It was never planned.. END
BEGIN NOW And it's inadequate to describe where I am. END
BEGIN NOW In the room of my house where the light's never been. END
BEGIN NOW Waiting for this day to end.. END
BEGIN NOW And these clocks keep unwinding and completely ignore. END
BEGIN NOW Everything that we hate or adore.. END
BEGIN NOW Once the page of a calendar is turned it's no more.. END
BEGIN NOW So tell me then, what was it for?. END
BEGIN NOW Oh tell me, what was it for?. END
BEGIN NOW Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning when you start to raise your head?. END
BEGIN NOW And does he sing to you incessantly from the space between your bed and wall?. END
BEGIN NOW Does he walk around all day at school with his feet inside your shoes?. END
BEGIN NOW Looking down every few steps to pretend he walks with you.. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched. END
BEGIN NOW And does he cry through broken sentences like I love you far too much?. END
BEGIN NOW Does he lay awake listening to your breath?. END
BEGIN NOW Worried you smoke too many cigarettes.. END
BEGIN NOW Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor?. END
BEGIN NOW For every speck of tile there's a thousand more. END
BEGIN NOW You won't ever see but most hold inside yourself eternally. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I drug your ghost across the country and we plotted out my death.. END
BEGIN NOW In every city, memories would whisper: "Here is where you rest.". END
BEGIN NOW I was determined in Chicago but I dug my teeth into my knees. END
BEGIN NOW And I settled for a telephone and sang into your machine.. END
BEGIN NOW You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw that her father gave to her.. END
BEGIN NOW She had eyes bright enough to burn me. They reminded me of yours.. END
BEGIN NOW And in a story told she was a little girl in a red-rouge, sun-bruised field. END
BEGIN NOW And there were rows of ripe tomatoes where a secret was concealed.. END
BEGIN NOW And it rose like thunder, clapped under our hands.. END
BEGIN NOW And it stretched for centuries to a diary entry's end where I wrote,. END
BEGIN NOW You make me happy oh!! when skies are gray. END
BEGIN NOW You make me happy oh!! when skies are gray and gray and gray.. END
BEGIN NOW Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest with hands. END
BEGIN NOW Stretched towards the calendar hanging itself. END
BEGIN NOW But I will not weep for those dying days.. END
BEGIN NOW For all the ones who've left there's a few that stayed.. END
BEGIN NOW And they found me here and pulled me from the grass where I was laid.. END
BEGIN NOW Now and again it seems worse than it is,. END
BEGIN NOW But mostly the view is accurate.. END
BEGIN NOW You see your breath in the air as you'll climb up the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW To that coffin you call your apartment.. END
BEGIN NOW And you sink in your chair, brush the snow from your hair. END
BEGIN NOW And drink the cold away.. END
BEGIN NOW And you're not really sure what you're doing this for. END
BEGIN NOW But you need something to fill up the days.. END
BEGIN NOW A few more hours.. END
BEGIN NOW There's a dream in my brain that just won't go away.. END
BEGIN NOW It's been stuck there since it came a few nights ago. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm standing on a bridge in the town where I lived. END
BEGIN NOW As a kid with my mom and my brothers.. END
BEGIN NOW And then the bridge disappears and I'm standing on air. END
BEGIN NOW With nothing holding me.. END
BEGIN NOW And I hang like a star, fucking glow in the dark,. END
BEGIN NOW For all those starving eyes to see,. END
BEGIN NOW Like the ones we've wished on.. END
BEGIN NOW But now I'm confused. Is this death really you?. END
BEGIN NOW And do these dreams have any meaning?. END
BEGIN NOW No. No, I think it's more like a ghost that's been following us both.. END
BEGIN NOW Something vague that we're not seeing,. END
BEGIN NOW Something more like a feeling.. END
BEGIN NOW You follow the footsteps echoes leading down a hall to a room.. END
BEGIN NOW There is music playing tiny bells with moving parts.. END
BEGIN NOW Here the shadows make things ugly, an effect quite undesirable.. END
BEGIN NOW The bold and yellow daylight grows like ivy across the wall. END
BEGIN NOW And it bounces off of the painted porcelain, tiny dancing doll.. END
BEGIN NOW Her body spins, as she pirouettes again, the world suddenly seems small.. END
BEGIN NOW On an off white, subtle morning you stretch your legs in the front seat.. END
BEGIN NOW And the road has made a vacuum where our voices used to be.. END
BEGIN NOW And you lay your head onto my shoulder, pour like water over me.. END
BEGIN NOW So if I just exist for the next ten minutes of this drive that would be fine.. END
BEGIN NOW And all these trees that line this curb would be rejoicing and alive.. END
BEGIN NOW Soon all the joy that pours from everything makes fountains of your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Because you finally understand the movement of a hand waving good-bye.. END
BEGIN NOW The fragile keep secrets, gathered in pockets,. END
BEGIN NOW And they'll sell them for nothing a cheap watch or locket. END
BEGIN NOW That kind of gold washes off.. END
BEGIN NOW And the sad act like lepers, they stick to the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW And long to ring bells of warning to tell of their coming. END
BEGIN NOW So that the pure can shut their doors.. END
BEGIN NOW And the angry are animals senseless and savage.. END
BEGIN NOW They act without order in logical lapses,. END
BEGIN NOW They stain their mouths with blood.. END
BEGIN NOW So take my hand, this barren land is alive tonight.. END
BEGIN NOW The corn has grown stalks that form a wall too high.. END
BEGIN NOW But the wind carries sounds that I can't see from beyond that line.. END
BEGIN NOW Then the stalks begin to sway. END
BEGIN NOW Oh stay with me Arienette until the wolves are away.. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Well the wicked are vultures, and they bake in the canyons.. END
BEGIN NOW They circle in sunlight and wait for their victims. END
BEGIN NOW To collapse and call to them.. END
BEGIN NOW And the desperate are water. They will run down forever. END
BEGIN NOW As they soak into silence mend up together,. END
BEGIN NOW In a dark and distant, dark and distant place.. END
BEGIN NOW So don't leave me here with only mirrors watching me.. END
BEGIN NOW This house it holds nothing but the memories.. END
BEGIN NOW And the moon it leaves silver but never sleep.. END
BEGIN NOW And then the silver turns to gray. END
BEGIN NOW Oh stay with me Arienette until the wolves are away.. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow when I wake up I'm finding my brother. END
BEGIN NOW And making him take me back down to the water.. END
BEGIN NOW That lake where we sailed and we laughed with our father.. END
BEGIN NOW I will not desert him. I will not desert him.. END
BEGIN NOW No matter how I may wish for a coffin so clean. END
BEGIN NOW Or these trees to undress all their leaves onto me.. END
BEGIN NOW I put my face in the dirt and then finally I see. END
BEGIN NOW The sky that has been avoiding me.. END
BEGIN NOW I started this letter I'm gonna send it to Ruba.. END
BEGIN NOW It will be blessed by her eyes on the gulf coast of Florida.. END
BEGIN NOW With her feet in the sand and one hand on her swimsuit,. END
BEGIN NOW She will recite the prayer of my pen.. END
BEGIN NOW Saying, ...time take us forward. Relief from this longing,. END
BEGIN NOW They can land that plane on my heart I don't care. END
BEGIN NOW Just give me November, the warmth of a whisper. END
BEGIN NOW In the freezing darkness of my room.. END
BEGIN NOW But no matter what I would do in attempt to replace.. END
BEGIN NOW All these pills that I take trying to balance my brain.. END
BEGIN NOW I've seen the curious girl with that look on her face.. END
BEGIN NOW So surprised she stares out from her display case.. END
BEGIN NOW The phone slips from a loose grip. END
BEGIN NOW Words were missed then, some apology. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't want to tell you this. END
BEGIN NOW No, it's just some guy she's been hanging out with. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know, the past couple weeks I guess. END
BEGIN NOW Well, thank you and hang up the phone. END
BEGIN NOW Let the funeral start. END
BEGIN NOW Hear the casket close. END
BEGIN NOW Let's pin split-black ribbon to your overcoat. END
BEGIN NOW Well, laughter pours from under doors. END
BEGIN NOW In this house, I don't understand that sound no more. END
BEGIN NOW Seems artificial, like a T.V. set. END
BEGIN NOW Well, haligh, haligh, a lie, haligh. END
BEGIN NOW This weight it must be satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW You offer only one reply. END
BEGIN NOW You know not what you do. END
BEGIN NOW But you tear and tear your hair from roots. END
BEGIN NOW Of that same head you have twice removed now. END
BEGIN NOW A lock of hair you said would prove. END
BEGIN NOW Our love would never die. END
BEGIN NOW Well ha ha ha. END
BEGIN NOW I remember everything. END
BEGIN NOW The words we spoke on freezing South Street. END
BEGIN NOW And all those mornings watching you get ready for school. END
BEGIN NOW You combed your hair inside that mirror. END
BEGIN NOW The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears. END
BEGIN NOW Something about those bright colors. END
BEGIN NOW Would always make you feel better. END
BEGIN NOW But now we speak with ruined tongues. END
BEGIN NOW And the words we say aren't meant for anyone. END
BEGIN NOW It's just a mumbled sentence to a passing acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW But there was once you. END
BEGIN NOW You said you hate my suffering. END
BEGIN NOW And you understood. END
BEGIN NOW And you'd take care of me. END
BEGIN NOW You'd always be there. END
BEGIN NOW Well where are you now?. END
BEGIN NOW Haligh, haligh, a lie, haligh. END
BEGIN NOW The plans were never finalized. END
BEGIN NOW But left to hang like yarn and twine. END
BEGIN NOW Dangling before my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW As you tear and tear your hair from roots. END
BEGIN NOW Of that same head you have twice removed now. END
BEGIN NOW A lock of hair you said would prove. END
BEGIN NOW Our love would never die. END
BEGIN NOW And I sing and sing of awful things. END
BEGIN NOW The pleasure that my sadness brings. END
BEGIN NOW As my fingers press onto the strings. END
BEGIN NOW In yet another clumsy chord. END
BEGIN NOW Haligh, haligh, an awful lie. END
BEGIN NOW This weight would now be satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna give you only one reply. END
BEGIN NOW I know not who I am. END
BEGIN NOW But I talk in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW To the stranger that appears. END
BEGIN NOW Our conversations are circles. END
BEGIN NOW Always one sided. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing is clear. END
BEGIN NOW Except we keep coming back. END
BEGIN NOW To this meaning that I lack. END
BEGIN NOW He says the choices were given. END
BEGIN NOW Now you must live them. END
BEGIN NOW Or just not live. END
BEGIN NOW But do you want that?. END
BEGIN NOW t the center of the world. END
BEGIN NOW There's a statue of a girl.. END
BEGIN NOW She is standing near a well. END
BEGIN NOW With a bucket bare and dry.. END
BEGIN NOW I went and looked her in the eyes. END
BEGIN NOW And she turned me into sand.. END
BEGIN NOW This clumsy form that I despise. END
BEGIN NOW It scattered easy in her hand.. END
BEGIN NOW And came to rest upon a beach,. END
BEGIN NOW With a million others there.. END
BEGIN NOW We sat and waited for the sea. END
BEGIN NOW To stretch out so that we could disappear. END
BEGIN NOW Into the endlessness of blue,. END
BEGIN NOW Into the horror of the truth.. END
BEGIN NOW You see, we are far less than we knew.. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, we are far less than we knew. END
BEGIN NOW But we knew what we could taste.. END
BEGIN NOW Girls found honey to drench our hands.. END
BEGIN NOW Men cut marble to mark our graves.. END
BEGIN NOW Said we'll need something to remind us of. END
BEGIN NOW All the sweetness that has passed through us. END
BEGIN NOW (fresh sangria and lemon tea).. END
BEGIN NOW The priests dressed children for a choir. END
BEGIN NOW (white-robed small voices praise Him). END
BEGIN NOW But found no joy in what was sung.. END
BEGIN NOW The funeral had begun. END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of the day. END
BEGIN NOW When you drive home to your place. END
BEGIN NOW From that job that makes you sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Back to the thoughts that keep you awake. END
BEGIN NOW Long after night has come to claim. END
BEGIN NOW Any light that still remains. END
BEGIN NOW In the corner of the frame. END
BEGIN NOW That you put around her face.. END
BEGIN NOW Two pills just weren't enough.. END
BEGIN NOW The alarm clock's going off. END
BEGIN NOW But you're not waking up.. END
BEGIN NOW This isn't happening, happening, happening,. END
BEGIN NOW Happening, happening. It is.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW Swiftly go the days.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW You wake up, then you undress.. END
BEGIN NOW It always is the same.. END
BEGIN NOW The sunrise and the sunsets.. END
BEGIN NOW You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain.. END
BEGIN NOW The sunrise and the sunsets. END
BEGIN NOW You realize then you forget what you've been trying to retain.. END
BEGIN NOW But everybody knows that it is all about the things. END
BEGIN NOW That get stuck inside of your head,. END
BEGIN NOW Like the songs your roommate sings. END
BEGIN NOW Or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed.. END
BEGIN NOW She raised her hands in the air, asked you,. END
BEGIN NOW When was the last time you looked in the mirror?. END
BEGIN NOW Cause you've changed.. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you've changed.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrises, sunsets.. END
BEGIN NOW You're hopeful then you regret.. END
BEGIN NOW The circle never breaks.. END
BEGIN NOW With a sunrise and a sunset there's a change of heart or address.. END
BEGIN NOW Is there nothing that remains?. END
BEGIN NOW For a sunrise or a sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW You're manic or you're depressed.. END
BEGIN NOW Will you ever feel ok?. END
BEGIN NOW For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress.. END
BEGIN NOW Did you really think she'd stay?. END
BEGIN NOW For a sunrise or a sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW You're either coming or you just left but you're always on the way.. END
BEGIN NOW Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet.. END
BEGIN NOW They are really just the same.. END
BEGIN NOW To the sunrise and the sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW The master and his servant have exactly the same fate.. END
BEGIN NOW It's a sunrise and a sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW From a cradle to a casket.. END
BEGIN NOW There is no way to escape.. END
BEGIN NOW The sunrise and the sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW Hold your sadness like a puppet, keep putting on the play.. END
BEGIN NOW But everything you do is leading to the point. END
BEGIN NOW Where you just won't know what to do.. END
BEGIN NOW And at that moment you may laugh. END
BEGIN NOW But there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you.. END
BEGIN NOW So it's true, the trick is complete.. END
BEGIN NOW Become everything you said you never would be.. END
BEGIN NOW You're a fool! You're a fool!. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise and the sunsets.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset, sunrises, sunsets.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise and the sunsets.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW Go home to your apartment. END
BEGIN NOW And put the cassette in the tape deck and let that fever play.. END
BEGIN NOW Sunrise, sunset.. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you Arienette?. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you Arienette?. END
BEGIN NOW Did you expect it all to stop at the wave of your hand?. END
BEGIN NOW Like the sun's just going to drop if it's night you demand.. END
BEGIN NOW Well, in the dark we're just air so the house might dissolve.. END
BEGIN NOW But once we are gone, who's gonna care if we were ever here at all?. END
BEGIN NOW Well, summer's going to come, it's gonna cloud our eyes again.. END
BEGIN NOW No need to focus when there's nothing that's worth seeing.. END
BEGIN NOW So we trade liquor for blood in an attempt to tip the scales.. END
BEGIN NOW I think you lost what you loved in that mess of details.. END
BEGIN NOW They seemed so important at the time. END
BEGIN NOW But now you can't even recall any of the names, faces, or lines.. END
BEGIN NOW It's more the feeling of it all.. END
BEGIN NOW Well, winter is going to end, I'm going to clean these veins again.. END
BEGIN NOW So close to dying that I finally can start living.. END
BEGIN NOW [There is a radio interview in the end of this track]. END
BEGIN NOW [Radio interviewer (impersonated by Matt Silcock of Lullaby for the Working Class) - R]. END
BEGIN NOW [Conor Oberst (impersonated by Todd Fink of The Faint) - C]. END
BEGIN NOW [Radio interviewer:] Hi, we're back, this is radio K[beep]x and we're here with Conor Oberst of the band Bright Eyes. How are you doing, Conor?. END
BEGIN NOW [Conor:] Fine, thanks, just a little wet.. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, it's still coming down out there?. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I sort of had to run from the car.. END
BEGIN NOW  Well, we are glad you made it! Now, your new album, "Fevers and Mirrors"... Tell us a little about the title. I know there's a good deal of repeated imagery in the lyrics; fevers, mirrors, scales, clocks: Could you discuss some of this?. END
BEGIN NOW Sure. Let's see, the fever's.... END
BEGIN NOW  First, First let me say that, this is a brilliant record, man, we're all really into it here at the station and we get lots of calls, it's really good stuff.. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks. Thanks a lot.. END
BEGIN NOW  So talk about some of the symbolisms.. END
BEGIN NOW The fever?. END
BEGIN NOW  Sure!. END
BEGIN NOW Well, the fever is basically, what ever ails you, or oppresses you... It could be anything, in my case it's my neurosis, my: depression... but I don't want it to be limited to that... it's certainly different for different people. It's whatever keeps you up at night.. END
BEGIN NOW  I see.. END
BEGIN NOW And the, and the mirror's like, as you might have guessed, self-examination, or reflection, or whatever form. This could be vanity, or self loathing. I, I know I'm, I'm guilty of both.. END
BEGIN NOW  That's interesting. How about the scale?. END
BEGIN NOW The scales are essentially our attempt to solve our problems quantitatively, through logic or rationalization. In my opinion it's often fruitless, but... always, no, not always... And the clocks and calendars it's uh... is just... time... our little measurements, it's like, it's always chasing after us.. END
BEGIN NOW  It is. It is. Uh, How about this Arienette, how does she fit into all this?. END
BEGIN NOW Umm, I'd prefer not to talk about it, in case she's listening.. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize she was a real person.. END
BEGIN NOW She's not. I made her up.. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, so she's not real?. END
BEGIN NOW Just as real as you or I.. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't think I understand.. END
BEGIN NOW Neither do I, but after I grow up, I will. I mean a lot... A lot of things: are really unclear for me right now.. END
BEGIN NOW  That's interesting. Ah, now you mentioned your depression.... END
BEGIN NOW ...No I didn't.. END
BEGIN NOW  You're from Nebraska , right?. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, so?. END
BEGIN NOW  Now, let me now if I'm getting too personal, but there seem to be a pretty dark past back there somewhere. What was it like for you growing up?. END
BEGIN NOW Dark? Not really... uh... actually I had a great childhood, my parents were wonderful. I went to a Catholic school. They have... they had money, so... it... It was all... easy. Basically I had everything I wanted, handed to me.. END
BEGIN NOW  Really? So some of the references, like babies in bathtubs, are not biographical?. END
BEGIN NOW Well I do have a brother who died in a bathtub. Drowned. Actually, I had five brothers who died that way.. END
BEGIN NOW [R: chuckles]. END
BEGIN NOW No, I'm serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, so, that's: They all got one song.. END
BEGIN NOW  Hmm.. END
BEGIN NOW It's kinda like walking out the door to discover it's a window.. END
BEGIN NOW  But your music is certainly very personal.. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, I put a lot of myself into what I do. But it's like, being an author you have to, free yourself to use symbolism and allegory to reach your goal and, and a part of that is, compassion, empathy for other people and their, and their situations. Some of what I sing comes from other people's experiences as well as my own. It:It shouldn't matter, the message is intended to be universal.. END
BEGIN NOW  I see what you mean.. END
BEGIN NOW Can you make that sound stop please?. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes! [a bell that has been softly ringing for the duration of the interview becomes silent] And your goal?. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. Uh, create feelings, I guess. A song? It never ends up the way you planned it, though.. END
BEGIN NOW  That's funny that you say that, do you think that.... END
BEGIN NOW Do you ever hear things that aren't really there?. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sorry, what?. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind. How long have you worked at this station?. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, just a few minutes. Uh, now you mentioned empathy for others. Would you say that that is what motivates you to make the music that you make?. END
BEGIN NOW No, not really. It's more a need for sympathy. I want people to feel sorry for me. I like the feel of the burn of the audience's eyes on me when I'm whispering all my darkest secrets into the microphone. When I was a kid, I used to carry this safety pin around with me, everywhere I went in my pocket. And when people weren't paying enough attention to me, I'd dig it into my arm until I started crying. Everyone would stop what they were doing and ask me what was the matter. I guess, I guess I kinda [unintelligible].. END
BEGIN NOW  Really? You're telling me you're doing all this for attention?. END
BEGIN NOW No, I hate it when people look at me. I get nauseous. In fact, I could care less what people think, about me. Do you feel that? Wanna dance?. END
BEGIN NOW  No, I'm feeling sick.. END
BEGIN NOW I really just wanna be warm yellow light that pours all over everyone I love.. END
BEGIN NOW  So, uh, you're gonna play something for us now. Is this a new song?. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, but I haven't written it yet. It's one I've been meaning to write, uh, called, "A Song To Pass The Time.". END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, that's a nice title.. END
BEGIN NOW [mumbles] No, it isn't. You should write your own scripts.. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah, I know!. END
BEGIN NOW  There is a middle-aged woman she's dragging her feet.. END
BEGIN NOW She carries baskets of clothes to a laundromat.. END
BEGIN NOW While the Mexican children kick rocks into the street. END
BEGIN NOW And they laugh in a language I don't understand.. END
BEGIN NOW But I love them.. END
BEGIN NOW Why do I love them?. END
BEGIN NOW So the neighborhood is dimming as I smoke on the porch. END
BEGIN NOW And watch the people as they pass enclosed inside their cars.. END
BEGIN NOW On their faces just anger or disappointment.. END
BEGIN NOW I start wishing there was something I could offer them.. END
BEGIN NOW A consolation, what could I offer them?. END
BEGIN NOW And they are sad in their suburbs robots water the lawn. END
BEGIN NOW And everything they touch gets dusted spotless.. END
BEGIN NOW And so they start to believe they've not touched anything at all.. END
BEGIN NOW And the cars in the driveway only multiply.. END
BEGIN NOW They are lost in their houses.. END
BEGIN NOW I have heard them sing in the shower. END
BEGIN NOW Making speeches to their sister on the telephone.. END
BEGIN NOW Saying, you come home.. END
BEGIN NOW Woman, you come here.. END
BEGIN NOW Don't stay so far away from me.. END
BEGIN NOW This weather has me wanting love more tangible.. END
BEGIN NOW Something I can hold cause it's getting cold.. END
BEGIN NOW I say hold up our fists to the flame in the sky. END
BEGIN NOW To block out the light that's reaching for our eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Cause it... cause it would blind us. Yeah it will blind us.. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I've locked my actions in the grooves of routine.. END
BEGIN NOW So I may never be free of this apathy.. END
BEGIN NOW But I wait for a letter that is coming to me.. END
BEGIN NOW She sends me pictures of the ocean in an envelope.. END
BEGIN NOW So there still is hope.. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I can be healed.. END
BEGIN NOW There is someone looking for what I've concealed. END
BEGIN NOW In my secret drawer, in my pockets deep,. END
BEGIN NOW You will find the reasons that I can't sleep and you will still want me.. END
BEGIN NOW But will you still want me? Will you still want?.... END
BEGIN NOW Well, I say come for the week.. END
BEGIN NOW You can sleep in my bed.. END
BEGIN NOW And pass through my life like a dream through my head.. END
BEGIN NOW It will... it will be easy. I'll make it easy.. END
BEGIN NOW But all I have for the moment is a song to pass the time.. END
BEGIN NOW A melody to keep me from worrying.. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, some simple progression to keep my fingers busy.. END
BEGIN NOW And words that are sure to come back to me. END
BEGIN NOW And they'll be laughing, and they'll be laughing.. END
BEGIN NOW My mediocrity.. END
BEGIN NOW My mediocrity.. END
BEGIN NOW (And they'll be laughing). END
BEGIN NOW My brother finds comfort in calculators.. END
BEGIN NOW He assigns every number a name.. END
BEGIN NOW He believes that they add up to certainty and he is upset with fractions that remain.. END
BEGIN NOW So I examine these maps with my eyes and at best I can trace with my. END
BEGIN NOW Finger all the way to that town where she went an attempt to forget the cracks and the lines of my face.. END
BEGIN NOW So Jetsabel cleaned out the closets for me and she piled the boxes in the hall.. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow when she wakes she'll come take them away and they will never haunt me again.. END
BEGIN NOW But it is still hard to sleep with the moons heavy beams.. END
BEGIN NOW I run barefoot to the backyard, just to freeze in my place by the rod iron gate, too afraid and ashamed to advance.. END
BEGIN NOW Today I walked through the snow and found a field of headstones.. END
BEGIN NOW They were in rows like the weeks on calendars where each box is a day that you can never escape, without pills or the poison of sleep.. END
BEGIN NOW These memories leak from these faucets that weep.. END
BEGIN NOW Hot tears splash against the shower floor and I stand in the steam as if inside a dream--. END
BEGIN NOW I can see her again by the sink from behind the bathroom mirror she pulls a thermometer and placed it under my tongue.. END
BEGIN NOW She said "you are as pale as a sheet, you look awful my sweet lay down and wait for the sun.". END
BEGIN NOW So I stayed in that bed. She brought me water and read each night from a volume out loud.. END
BEGIN NOW She whispered soft poetry.. END
BEGIN NOW Her favorite was Anabel Lee.. END
BEGIN NOW And those words, like these drugs comforted me.. END
BEGIN NOW But the clocks kept waving their hands and she could not understand why my temperature would never drop.. END
BEGIN NOW And although she promised with tears that she would always be here I heard truth like the sounding sea.. END
BEGIN NOW I said, "My Arienette, oh how soon you'll forget this house will never be your home.. END
BEGIN NOW And you will leave in the fall when the trees become graves and their color lie dead in the grass.". END
BEGIN NOW Gold and green torture me like the lies I believe too easily.. END
BEGIN NOW Oh my Jetsabel, look at this hell that I have made.. END
BEGIN NOW If you want maybe drop by sometime put some flowers on my grave.. END
BEGIN NOW So that I will look beautiful in my silent sepulchre.. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah that's fine throw those dresses away I don't want anything of hers.. END
BEGIN NOW For the moon never shines and the stars never rise without bringing me dreams.. END
BEGIN NOW Haunted by the ghosts of those bright eyes.. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay in the grass?. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay there?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you want to be found?. END

BEGIN NOW Isn't the Sun even going to try to find a hole in the clouds?. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't the Sun even going to try to find a hole in the clouds?. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it even gonna try. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it even gonna try. END
BEGIN NOW To find a hole in the clouds. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it even gonna try. END
BEGIN NOW Why won't it try, then. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay in the grass?. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay there?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you want to be found?. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay so low in the grass?. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay there?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you want to be found. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay in the grass?. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lay in the grass?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you want to be found?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you want to be found?. END
BEGIN NOW I thought that you wanted that.. END
BEGIN NOW To pretend no one can find. END
BEGIN NOW The fallacies of morning rose. END

BEGIN NOW It's time to move over.... END
BEGIN NOW Smeared black ink... your palms are sweaty. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm barely listening to last demands. END
BEGIN NOW I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath. END
BEGIN NOW Where I am. END
BEGIN NOW Where I am. END
BEGIN NOW I'll wear my badge... a vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest. END
BEGIN NOW That tells your new friends I am a visitor here.... END
BEGIN NOW I am not permanent. END
BEGIN NOW And the only thing keeping me dry is. END
BEGIN NOW Where I am. END
BEGIN NOW Where I am. END
BEGIN NOW Where I am. END
BEGIN NOW You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex. END

BEGIN NOW We kiss they're perfectly aligned. END
BEGIN NOW And I have to speculate. END
BEGIN NOW That God himself did make. END
BEGIN NOW Us into corresponding shapes. END
BEGIN NOW Like puzzle pieces from the clay. END
BEGIN NOW And true, it may seem like a stretch,. END
BEGIN NOW But its thoughts like this that catch. END
BEGIN NOW My troubled head when you're away. END
BEGIN NOW When I am missing you to death. END
BEGIN NOW When you are out there on the road. END
BEGIN NOW For several weeks of shows. END
BEGIN NOW And when you scan the radio,. END
BEGIN NOW I hope this song will guide you home. END

BEGIN NOW Last week I had the strangest dream. END
BEGIN NOW Where everything was exactly how it seemed. END
BEGIN NOW Where there was never any mystery of who shot John F. Kennedy. END
BEGIN NOW It was just a man with something to prove. END
BEGIN NOW Slightly bored and severely confused. END
BEGIN NOW He steadied his rifle with his target in the center. END
BEGIN NOW And became famous on that day in November. END
BEGIN NOW Don't wake me I plan on sleeping. END

BEGIN NOW Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in. END
BEGIN NOW Again last night I had that strange dream. END
BEGIN NOW Where everything was exactly how it seemed. END
BEGIN NOW Where concerns about the world getting warmer. END
BEGIN NOW The people thought they were just being rewarded. END
BEGIN NOW For treating others as they'd like to be treated. END
BEGIN NOW For obeying stop signs and curing diseases. END
BEGIN NOW For mailing letters with the address of the sender. END
BEGIN NOW Now we can swim any day in November. END
BEGIN NOW Don't wake me I plan on sleeping. END

BEGIN NOW I can't accept that it's over.... END
BEGIN NOW And I will block the door like a goalie tending the net. END
BEGIN NOW In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry. END
BEGIN NOW So just say how to make it right. END
BEGIN NOW And i swear I'll do my best to comply. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better. END
BEGIN NOW Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together. END
BEGIN NOW I feel I must interject here you're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW With these revisions and gaps in history. END
BEGIN NOW So let me help you remember.. END
BEGIN NOW I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear.. END
BEGIN NOW I've prepared a lecture on why i have to leave. END

BEGIN NOW I take a breath and pull the air in 'til there's nothing left. END
BEGIN NOW I'm feeling green like teenage lovers between the sheets. END
BEGIN NOW Ba ba ba ba .... END
BEGIN NOW Knuckles clenched to white as the landing gear retract for flight. END
BEGIN NOW My head's a balloon inflating with the altitude. END
BEGIN NOW Ba ba ba ba.... END
BEGIN NOW I watch the patchwork farms' slow fade into the ocean's arms. END
BEGIN NOW And from here they can't see me stare. END
BEGIN NOW The stale taste of recycled air. END
BEGIN NOW I watch the patchwork farms' slow fade into the ocean's arms. END
BEGIN NOW Calm down, release your cares. END
BEGIN NOW The stale taste of recycled air. END
BEGIN NOW I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London underground when it struck me. END
BEGIN NOW That I've been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and sound like a movie. END
BEGIN NOW So I changed my plans I rented a camera and a van and then I called you. END
BEGIN NOW "I need you to pretend that we are in love again" and you agreed to. END
BEGIN NOW I want so badly to believe that "there is truth, that love is real". END
BEGIN NOW And I want life in every word to the extent that it's absurd. END
BEGIN NOW I greased the lens and framed the shot using a friend as my stand-in. END
BEGIN NOW The script it called for rain but it was clear that day so we faked it. END
BEGIN NOW The marker snapped and I yelled "quiet on the set" and then called "action!". END
BEGIN NOW And I kissed you in a style that Clark Gable would have admired (I thought it classic). END
BEGIN NOW I want so badly to believe that "there is truth, that love is real". END
BEGIN NOW And I want life in every word to the extent that it's absurd. END
BEGIN NOW I know you're wise beyond your years, but do you ever get the fear. END
BEGIN NOW That your perfect verse is just a lie you tell yourself to help you get by?. END
BEGIN NOW I've got a cupboard with cans of food, filtered water,. END
BEGIN NOW And pictures of you and I'm not coming out. END
BEGIN NOW Until this is all over. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm looking through the glass where the light bends. END
BEGIN NOW At the cracks. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs pretending. END
BEGIN NOW The echoes belong to someone. END
BEGIN NOW Someone I used to know. END
BEGIN NOW And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go. END
BEGIN NOW Ba ba ba.... END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to walk through the empty streets. END
BEGIN NOW And feel something constant under my feet,. END
BEGIN NOW But all the news reports recommended that. END
BEGIN NOW I stay indoors. END
BEGIN NOW Because the air outside will make our cells. END
BEGIN NOW Divide at an alarming rate until our shells. END
BEGIN NOW Simply cannot hold all our insides in,. END
BEGIN NOW And that's when we'll explode. END
BEGIN NOW (and it won't be a pretty sight). END
BEGIN NOW And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go. END
BEGIN NOW Ba ba ba.... END
BEGIN NOW And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go. END
BEGIN NOW Ba ba ba.... END
BEGIN NOW And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go. END

BEGIN NOW And we'll become. END
BEGIN NOW This place is a prison. END
BEGIN NOW And these people aren't your friends. END
BEGIN NOW Inhaling thrills through $20 bills. END
BEGIN NOW And the tumblers are drained and then flooded again. END
BEGIN NOW And again. END
BEGIN NOW Ther're guards at the on ramps armed to the teeth. END
BEGIN NOW And you may case the grounds from the cascades to puget sound,. END
BEGIN NOW But you are not permitted to leave. END
BEGIN NOW I know there's a big world out there like the one i saw on the screen. END
BEGIN NOW In my living room late last night,. END
BEGIN NOW It was almost too bright to see. END
BEGIN NOW And i know that it's not a party if it happens every night. END
BEGIN NOW Pretending there's glamour and candelabra. END
BEGIN NOW When you're drinking by candlelight. END
BEGIN NOW What does it take to get a drink in this place?. END
BEGIN NOW What does it take, how long must i wait?. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be the grapes fermented,. END
BEGIN NOW Bottled and served with the table set in my finest suit. END
BEGIN NOW Like a perfect gentlemen. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick. END
BEGIN NOW Where you will sit and contemplate your day. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning. END
BEGIN NOW In an open tab when your judgment's on the brink. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite. END
BEGIN NOW Albums back as you're lying there drifting off to sleep.... END
BEGIN NOW I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you.... END
BEGIN NOW You won't have to strain to look into my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat. END
BEGIN NOW With the collar up so you won't catch a cold. END
BEGIN NOW I want to take you far from the cynics in this town. END
BEGIN NOW And kiss you on the mouth. END
BEGIN NOW We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene,. END
BEGIN NOW Start a brand new colony. END
BEGIN NOW Where everything will change,. END
BEGIN NOW We'll give ourselves new names (identities erased). END
BEGIN NOW The sun will heat the grounds. END
BEGIN NOW Under our bare feet in this brand new colony. END
BEGIN NOW Everything will change, oOo oOo.... END
BEGIN NOW I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing. END
BEGIN NOW It will be a natural anthem, familiar it will seem. END
BEGIN NOW It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay. END
BEGIN NOW And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day. END
BEGIN NOW I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind. END
BEGIN NOW Because all the names and places I have taken from real life. END
BEGIN NOW So please don't be upset at this portrait that I paint. END
BEGIN NOW It may be a little biased, but at least I spelled your name right.... END
BEGIN NOW I never knew this could happen to me. END
BEGIN NOW I know now fragility. END
BEGIN NOW I know there's people who I haven't told. END
BEGIN NOW I know of people who are getting old. END
BEGIN NOW Wish I could speak in just one sweep. END
BEGIN NOW What you are and what you mean to me. END
BEGIN NOW Instead I mumble randomly. END
BEGIN NOW You stand by and enlighten me. END
BEGIN NOW In a dream I lost my teeth again. END
BEGIN NOW Calling me woman and half man. END
BEGIN NOW Yes in a dream all my teeth fell out. END
BEGIN NOW A cracked smile and a silent shout. END
BEGIN NOW A cracked smile and a silent shout. END
BEGIN NOW If I explain it once thoroughly. END
BEGIN NOW He'll have you later 'cause it's never free. END
BEGIN NOW You were at the gigantic spree. END
BEGIN NOW I caught a glimpse now it haunts me. END
BEGIN NOW I caught a glimpse now it haunts me. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes are sober and this is the plan. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sitting in a car heading Neverland. END
BEGIN NOW A fancy man a fancy man. END
BEGIN NOW He's pointing with the fingers that are left on his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Eyes are hazel but far too cold. END
BEGIN NOW Looking out for love. END
BEGIN NOW But none of us can. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the monkey that I've been told of. END
BEGIN NOW I'm staring at the money. END
BEGIN NOW That burns in my hand. END
BEGIN NOW I'm dancing for dollars. END
BEGIN NOW And for a fancy man. END
BEGIN NOW Come right over. END
BEGIN NOW I'll knock on your shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW This is a story and this is what I've planned. END

BEGIN NOW Dude, I got so turnt last night!. END
BEGIN NOW This article doe. END
BEGIN NOW That party was too turnt!. END
BEGIN NOW It’s hella hot outside today. END
BEGIN NOW Karen only wears oversized frockets and leggings. END
BEGIN NOW  She’s hella basic. END
BEGIN NOW She threw shade at me in front of everyone and thought I wouldn’t realize. END
BEGIN NOW This song is giving me life! YAS!. END
BEGIN NOW I totally ship Piper and Alex! My all-time favorite ship is Ross and Rachel. END
BEGIN NOW Those tacos were good AF. END
BEGIN NOW Did you see his eyes? He was lit af. END
BEGIN NOW You always have my back, fam. END
BEGIN NOW let's do brunch. END
BEGIN NOW best brunch spot in the city, you can't even get there on the bus. END
BEGIN NOW i can't, i'm in an uber right now. END
BEGIN NOW A truly tasty burger requires no secrets; use only fresh ingredients, prepare them to order, and serve it as promptly as possible. END
BEGIN NOW  This one was delivered as promised on a soft Firebrand bun with pungent Point Reyes bleu cheese and sweet caramelized onions. END
BEGIN NOW  I opted for mine to be grilled medium-rare and to be spared the mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW The kitchen at GLK did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW  My goodness was this sandwich delicious! Augmented by perfectly seasoned French fries and an ice cold pint, I relished every bite while dining outside overlooking Lake Merritt, enjoying the company of my girlfriend and strangers that were seated close by who all felt as strongly about their selection of entrees as I did mine. END
BEGIN NOW They told me that that a total remodeling of the place had just been completed three days ago. END
BEGIN NOW  So I guess I'll just have to come back to check that out at brunch someday soon. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm already looking forward to it already. END
BEGIN NOW I'm torn because the food was inventive yet pedestrian in execution. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs Bennie is my fave and go to brunch meal. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the yardstick of a good spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Again,  torn. END
BEGIN NOW  It was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW Innovative- check. END
BEGIN NOW  They replaced the English muffin with rye bread, presumably from Acme, and the fruit with an salad with a nice vinegarette. END
BEGIN NOW   Score!. END
BEGIN NOW Execution- the eggs came out over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  They should've never come out of the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  They have just re-opened after a major reno and people are swarming like bees. END
BEGIN NOW  I put this down to the kitchen getting used to the new flow. END
BEGIN NOW Staff- totally saved their bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  Really. END
BEGIN NOW   The hostess is very gracious and adept at empathizing with customers. END
BEGIN NOW  It takes a special person to get people excited for an hour wait by sending them to the farmers market and making it convenient to check in. END
BEGIN NOW   I sat in essentially the serve area for the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartender made it the best seat in the house. END
BEGIN NOW  She is very thorough and attentive in her job. END
BEGIN NOW  Her mimosa was delish. END
BEGIN NOW Trouble is the crowd and a need to turn tables. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch is supposed to be, or at least feel, leisurely. END
BEGIN NOW  It was fun but I can see myself relaxing there. END
BEGIN NOW I absolutely love this spot. END
BEGIN NOW I was looking for a good brunch place not in SF and found Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  The restaurant is pretty damn small but if you can ge. END
BEGIN NOW t there at a good time, the wait isn't terrible. END
BEGIN NOW  It's also nice that the lake is right outside so you can just hang out if the weather permits. END
BEGIN NOW My friend and I ordered the Savory French Toast and the Pork Belly Hash. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't rteally remember the hash, because the savory french toast was SO FREAKING GOOD. END
BEGIN NOW  The flavor combos here just worked so well. END
BEGIN NOW  So well, in fact, that I ate here a little over a year ago and I'm just now writing the review. END
BEGIN NOW I was also recently introduced to chilaquiles, which I see is on the menu here, so I'm making it a goal to return sometime soon!. END
BEGIN NOW No wait at dinner time. END
BEGIN NOW   Thoughtful food prepared with love and care. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice breeze on the patio and lovely alcoholic and nonalcoholic drink options. END
BEGIN NOW   I will be back for brunch to see if it can live up to the hype and long lines. END
BEGIN NOW This is by far in my top three places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW   I've usually just picked up a sandwhich, but I went for breakfast and has just a full on delicious meal. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a little chilly, but they provided blankets, which actually made the experience a little more fun. END
BEGIN NOW The coffee is just right. END
BEGIN NOW   I got the soft scrambled eggs and it was just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   My dad got the oyako egg salad open faced on rye and the eggs had such a different flavor and texture but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW I just love the flavors here. END
BEGIN NOW   The portions are perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   And I absolutely loved the staff. END
BEGIN NOW   Whatever they're doing just keep doing it. END
BEGIN NOW   Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW 30 minute wait for brunch on a Monday? Must be that good, eh it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for my birthday with a few friends, and we all shared what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD: I had the chilaquiles since it was highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW  Personally, I didn't like how soggy the chips were and the salsa lacked flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Out of the two dishes my friends ordered, oyaka and savory French toast, the savory French toast stood out for its unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  There is actually no French toast involved, just toasted rye bread for the base, topped with arugula and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  The oyaka was an open faced egg salad sandwich topped with chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend liked it, and I thought it just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  But honesty, it's hard to mess up an egg salad. END
BEGIN NOW DRINKS: We shared a pitcher of POG mimosas, which were perfect for the hot weather. END
BEGIN NOW OVERALL: I might come back to try out other things on the menu, but will stay away from the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW What a lovely spot. END
BEGIN NOW  My beau and I went here on our last day in California, and to check out the spot as the friend we visited is the manager. END
BEGIN NOW  Most of the seating is outside (until the expansion is completed) but it was a nice enough day so we plopped down and ordered. END
BEGIN NOW I had the strawberry French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  My boo had the eggs Benedict with toast, a side of greens and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  Our meal was so amazing!! Some of the best eggs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  They were light and fluffy yet moist and cheesy without being over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  The French toast was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Lightly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Fresh strawberries, whip cream and yummy maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW It hasn't even been a month since our visit and I already miss the food. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're in the Oakland area, do your mouth a favor and swing by this spot. END
BEGIN NOW 4. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm falling more and more in love with Oakland each time I visit, especially this area around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Such gorgeous views with hip things to do, like brunch! I randomly searched for brunch places around here, and Grand Lake Kitchen was first on the list. END
BEGIN NOW  My boyfriend and I put our names on the list, took a brief walk around Lake Merritt, then came back just in time for our names to be called. END
BEGIN NOW We were seated on the outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW  It was a warm Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect for brunch outside. END
BEGIN NOW  What a lively vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Much different from having brunch in San Francisco, I'd say. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Pastrami Benedict which was served on rye bread. END
BEGIN NOW  so unique and tasty! Lots of cool things on the menu, whether brunch, lunch, or snacks. END
BEGIN NOW  My boyfriend got the Pork Belly Hash which did not look as appealing as the Pastrami Benedict but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Inside the actual restaurant seems more narrow, but you get to see the chefs work their magic, which is pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall it's definitely worth the trek to Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  They have an excellent selection of meats that you can't miss!. END
BEGIN NOW Got here around 11 and didn't get seated until 11:45. END
BEGIN NOW  Be prepared for that wait!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is tiny! But the food is great and the Bellinis are pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the savory French toast and would recommend adding the prosciutto as I went without and kind of felt it was lacking. END
BEGIN NOW  I did love that the savory French toast had arugella and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  Yuuuuum! Plus poached eggs were cooked well. END
BEGIN NOW  One was slightly over done but didn't affect the dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW Friend ordered the soft scramble and it looked. END
BEGIN NOW  basic but tasted pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW Although a tiny spot along Lake Merritt, Grand Lake Kitchen is truly a gem! I stopped in for a late breakfast/brunch and I would highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW  Although it's tempting to sit inside at the counter and watch the chefs work their magic, the umbrellaed outdoor patio gives a beautiful (although a touch away) view of beautiful Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Although we visited on a Monday late morning (note: they're closed all day Tuesdays!), there was a steady stream of people waiting for tables throughout our visit. END
BEGIN NOW We started with a bottled rose lemonade (although it isn't made in house, I always order a Fentimans soda when available) and a hibiscus cleanse (more sour than I expected but different in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW  From there we ordered the dungeness crab appetizer, served on toasted bread with avocado and topped with fresh greens. END
BEGIN NOW  This was truly a spectacular dish, the crab was amazing and the flavors combined perfectly and were crisp and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect appetizer to split between two people. END
BEGIN NOW  For our main course we ordered the Italian sandwich, which they cut in the kitchen for us and served on two plates, a nice touch, with a pickled vegetable on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  The ACME bread that it was served on (as most of the sandwiches are served on) is spectacular, sandwiches delicious meats, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  You will not be disappointed with this pick from the menu!. END
BEGIN NOW Grand Lake Kitchen is a restaurant that, if I lived in the area, I would return to over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and I've heard from others positive things about so many dishes. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a place where it'd be easy to explore the menu and always want to order something new. END
BEGIN NOW  They also sell a variety of specialty products in the restaurant, including Durham, NC made Big Spoon peanut butter (shout out to my home city!) One note: they don't accept American Express here. END
BEGIN NOW This is my favorite brunch spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  You have to get there early though, there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW  I think the wait is worth it! The front patio is great too, it's right across from lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  I love the pastrami eggs Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW  The pellinis are super good too! Even if it's cold out, sit on the front prior. END
BEGIN NOW  They will give you blankets to keep warm. END
BEGIN NOW Cheers to Yelp again for helping me find a delicious brunch place. END
BEGIN NOW  My bf's favorite meal of the day is brunch so off we go searching for one when I found this place. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm assuming they're expanding since there's construction going on next door. END
BEGIN NOW  Great if they are!. END
BEGIN NOW Seatings are limited but we went on a weekday so snagged a table right away. END
BEGIN NOW  Love their outdoor seating area that is across from Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Great place for a full belly then cross the street to walk it off. END
BEGIN NOW We order the Savory French Toast and Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  Great house coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  Would have been nice if they came by to check on us and refill it without asking. END
BEGIN NOW but waitress was a sweetheart so all good. END
BEGIN NOW SFT was delicious! I failed to add on prosciutto and it was still rich with flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Wouldn't think that of just toast, eggs, arugula and cheese but the combination with the herb oil and sauté wild mushrooms made it a worth-order dish!. END
BEGIN NOW Now to the Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW I love Mexican food but can't bring myself to like it for breakfast/brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  It's my personal taste so don't take my word for it. END
BEGIN NOW  BF thought it was good but not exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe. END
BEGIN NOW only maybe if they give you an option to add carne asada or al pastor. END
BEGIN NOW now that would be my type of a brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW Short and sweet:. END
BEGIN NOW "Deli-style" old-school restaurant feel. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was everything I've heard about it being. END
BEGIN NOW  We had the savory French toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't be scared, homie. END
BEGIN NOW  It was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been hearing about it for months. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything it was supposed to be. END
BEGIN NOW Friendly, attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW With a beautiful view situated right across Lake Merritt, this place is in a perfect spot to sit back on a Sunday morning and eat some delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a 20 minute wait and none of us minded when they handed us some mimosas and coffee so that we could sit in their outside patio soaking up some sun. END
BEGIN NOW   Lucky for us, the weather was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  Warm enough to take off our jackets and grey blankets draped on the chairs in case we got chilly. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get to the most important part of this experience and talk about the food. END
BEGIN NOW    Because that's what we care about the most right?  Here you go folks, straight from the menu right to you. END
BEGIN NOW *CRAB TOAST - DUNGENESS CRAB, AVOCADO, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPER VINAIGRETTE, SOURDOUGH 14. END
BEGIN NOW 00. END
BEGIN NOW   Yessss. END
BEGIN NOW  Generous portion of crab meat, salad greens and perfectly toasted sourdough. END
BEGIN NOW   Couldn't get enough of this stuff. END
BEGIN NOW   It was so good that had they given us a bigger portion, I would have kept stuffing my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW   Not cute. END
BEGIN NOW *CHILAQUILES - TORTILLA CHIPS, SALSA ROJA, BLACK BEANS, 2 EGGS SUNNY, AVOCADO, QUESO FRESCO, SOUR CREAM, PICKLED RED ONIONS 12. END
BEGIN NOW 00  I'm going to be in the minority and say that I wasn't impressed with this. END
BEGIN NOW   The red sauce was bland and nothing about this stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW   Wouldn't order it again. END
BEGIN NOW *SAVORY FRENCH TOAST - RYE BREAD IN PORCINI BATTER, 2 POACHED EGGS, WILD MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, ARUGULA, HERB OIL 13. END
BEGIN NOW 00  Savory French Toast?  Talk about first time for everything. END
BEGIN NOW   I was glad I got to pop this cherry because boy oh boy. END
BEGIN NOW   This was good. END
BEGIN NOW   The french toast itself was slightly crunchy on the outside, seasoned with a pinch of salt. END
BEGIN NOW  The rest of the ingredients were the perfect accompaniment. END
BEGIN NOW   Pancetta on top gave it a nice salty kick and we practically inhaled this entire plate. END
BEGIN NOW I have to add in that their bathroom was immaculate. END
BEGIN NOW   If you've read my other reviews, you know how much I appreciate a clean toilet bowl. END
BEGIN NOW   Good job Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   You have impressed me. END
BEGIN NOW perfect for wkend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are the best. END
BEGIN NOW   we always come here for these. END
BEGIN NOW we've tried some benedicts. END
BEGIN NOW and it was good too but Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are something really special about this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW all servers are super nice!!! Thank that I can start my wkend morning pleasantly w these great food and awesome servers. END
BEGIN NOW THEY ARE BACK AND THEY BETTA!. END
BEGIN NOW Bigger inside more seating with a bar! Same amazing customer service and delicious food! Love this place so much I always leave happy and stuffed. END
BEGIN NOW People who have read my reviews know that breakfast/brunch is my least favorite meal to eat out. END
BEGIN NOW  Mainly because I'm always underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW  I've yet to find an amazing brunch in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW Grand Lake Kitchen has been on my list to try though due to the great reviews and alluring photos. END
BEGIN NOW  Since me and the BF were free on a Thursday morning, I decided to give it a try!. END
BEGIN NOW There was no wait, but we decided to sit outside since it was nice and cool. END
BEGIN NOW  They gave us blankets to keep warm, which I thought was a nice touch!. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the chilaquiles and the savory french toast. END
BEGIN NOW  It was my first time having chilaquiles and I wasn't that impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Soggy chips, coquita cheese and unseasoned black beans. END
BEGIN NOW  The scrambled eggs were soft but lackluster on their own. END
BEGIN NOW   Ample amount of avocado! I felt like everything was on the bland side and I needed to use salt on everything (which I usually never do). END
BEGIN NOW  The savory french toast was interesting and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the mushrooms! But I found the huge amount of arugula to be a bit much. END
BEGIN NOW  Portions were decent size. END
BEGIN NOW  However, it wasn't a WOW dish for me either. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, I found both dishes to be just okay. END
BEGIN NOW The service was really friendly and attentive though, checking up on use to make sure we were good since we were the only ones sitting outside. END
BEGIN NOW The search continues. END
BEGIN NOW Extremely cute brunch & lunch place in Oakland near Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  This spot is kind of small and crammed, but the food is fresh and not too greasy. END
BEGIN NOW  My partner and I split the breakfast sandwich and ordered a side salad with roasted chicken. END
BEGIN NOW  The breakfast sandwich was delicious and I especially loved the acme bread it was on. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread was soft and not too hard and it blended well with the eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  We decided to substitute the ham for bacon at a $1 extra as I am not a fan of ham. END
BEGIN NOW  The salad was pretty good too and the dressing had a mustard vinaigrette dressing. END
BEGIN NOW I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try the pork belly hash which is only served on the weekends so I will definitely need to be back when I'm in the Bay Area again. END
BEGIN NOW  They also sell chips, spreads, bread and some other groceries on a shelf near the entrance. END
BEGIN NOW Grand Lake Kitchen is/was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I have no complaints about the food or the service. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I don't think it warrants the rating it has on here. END
BEGIN NOW I had one of their recommended sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW  It was good, but it was nothing to write home about. END
BEGIN NOW  If you decide to eat here, the portions can be small, so you may have to order side dishes. END
BEGIN NOW There are a couple of things I have on repeat at this joint. END
BEGIN NOW Because they don't have a ton of veggie options. END
BEGIN NOW French toast with oven-toasted blackberries? Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Huevos rancheros? Good but not Mexican enough (calm down, I'm Mexican, so I have license to say that). END
BEGIN NOW Red potato salad? Good. END
BEGIN NOW Obama sammie? Great:). END
BEGIN NOW Usually love brunching at Oakland Grill around the corner; in fact it's my fave spot in Oakland to brunch hands down but decided to try something different so we tried out Chop Bar instead. END
BEGIN NOW Ordered the pork belly hash, it was absolutely delish, hats off to the chefs. END
BEGIN NOW  Also ordered mimosas, it was meh. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend wasnt impressed with this place however the ambience more then made up for it. END
BEGIN NOW  The interior had a beautiful layout woodsy country theme with a modern twist. END
BEGIN NOW  Decided to try the outdoor sitting, just perfect for a summer day. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice cool breeze and the opportunity to people watch :). END
BEGIN NOW 2 stars for the servers, they were not friendly, lacked enthusiasm but I didn't let that ruin my vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Check out this spot when you're in the area!. END
BEGIN NOW Decent place for weekend brunch in a casual, relaxed setting. END
BEGIN NOW I opted for the eggs Benedict, which was pretty good - the Hollandaise sauce was nice and smooth and the eggs were cooked perfectly, although the English muffin was a bit tough. END
BEGIN NOW  I also enjoyed the Bloody Mary with bacon, which had a good combination of saltiness and spice. END
BEGIN NOW Service is not the most engaging, but adequate for the prices. END
BEGIN NOW Friendly service, chic-industrial interior, so-so brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW The pork belly hash left something to be desired. END
BEGIN NOW  so says mi amigo. END
BEGIN NOW And the Eggs ala Cazuela with Veggie Mojo? Well, first let me translate that for non espanol speakers- eggs baked in roasted tomato-pepper sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Now for my review of that dish. END
BEGIN NOW  En espanol- Es ok. END
BEGIN NOW  In English- It's okay. END
BEGIN NOW Two eggs swimming in tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Soak up the sun (of sauce) with roasted potatoes and 2 small slices of acme bread. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel a side salad or some greenery would've spruced things up- evened out that sauce, carbs, and eggs dynamic. END
BEGIN NOW  Hello, Salt. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW The laid-back vibe and open window seating creates an enjoyable atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  Close to Jack London square (not near the water but in the warehouse area), Chop Bar is a 10 minute walk from the Lake Merritt bart stop. END
BEGIN NOW  I hear their oxtail poutine fries are good, so I'd get that if I came another time. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems like a fun place for a happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW I've been here twice and I have yet to eat anything that I would reorder. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks, however, are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW The bacon bloody Mary is tangy, spicy, sweet and robust. END
BEGIN NOW  Do yourself a favor and get a group together for brunch and order the Bacon Bloody Mary. END
BEGIN NOW  Your taste buds will appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW isited on Valentine's Day!. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't too busy yet since we came early. END
BEGIN NOW  Food was aiiittteee. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the polenta and mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW  Mimosa was good. END
BEGIN NOW  Polenta was fine. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a cute place f'sho. END
BEGIN NOW The cute table gave my sweater dress a splinter. END
BEGIN NOW  Good thing it didn't puncture through my dress. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing else on the menu stood out to me so I probably won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW It'a located in good ol' Jack London square. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice location good for dates. END
BEGIN NOW  Walk around and catch the farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW  Or catch whatever is going on at Jack London square! They have Jack of all trades. END
BEGIN NOW  Movies in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW  The list goes on. END
BEGIN NOW Great food at reasonable prices. END
BEGIN NOW  Taken out of town guests here twice and everyone has commented on the excellent quality of the food. END
BEGIN NOW Food - fantastic! I've tried or sampled: pork banh mi, mussels, chicken torta, the chop burger, Ruben, and fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW  All were flawless and would order each item again. END
BEGIN NOW  I would give special attention to the broth with the mussels and ask for extra bread; you don't want to let that broth go to waste. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks- again fantastic! I've tried the Bloody Mary with and without Bacon - highly recommend either as they tickle all different flavor areas on your tongue. END
BEGIN NOW   Also had a Spicy Q, drink with rum and jalapeño, would order on the rocks next time but delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Service - first visit was absolutely amazing - server was a mind reader - on it for drink orders and brought extra bread for the mussels without us even asking. END
BEGIN NOW   I tipped 30% in appreciation. END
BEGIN NOW Second visit was sub-par. END
BEGIN NOW  I just felt like the server didn't want to be there and didn't ask if we wanted a second round of drinks when we were low. END
BEGIN NOW  Ended up not ordering more drinks because we finished our food. END
BEGIN NOW  Also asked how was the food while facing another table and not making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW  Head wasn't in the game. END
BEGIN NOW  Essentially barely checking on us after the food came out. END
BEGIN NOW  I was server for 4 years, we all have those off days (or hangovers), I get it. END
BEGIN NOW Atmosphere - really love the bar and wood elements inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Pig pictures on the walls and pig toilet paper holder in bathroom is a funny touch. END
BEGIN NOW  Saw a TV but it was not on during lunch hours for either visit. END
BEGIN NOW not sure if that was intentional or not but it created more of a conversational experience at my table with dudes who would have normally zoned out to sportscenter. END
BEGIN NOW  Didn't bother me either way, just felt it should be noted. END
BEGIN NOW Overall - 4 Stars - would give them a 5 except for service on second visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect ratings are reserved for perfect restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW Pastrami Potato Hash was well seasoned, poached eggs were done perfectly and the potatoes were solid. END
BEGIN NOW The frittata was a unique twist on the classic. END
BEGIN NOW  There's was thinner with a crispy bottom vs traditional ones that is thicker and more reminiscent of a pie. END
BEGIN NOW The variety is good but not the best for vegetarians especially during brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Expect to wait especially during peak times. END
BEGIN NOW Overall Thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad I got a chance to try Chop Bar and more grateful that I didn't leave disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW Not going to lie, one of the best parts of Chop Bar is that you can call 30 min in advance and put your name down for a table. END
BEGIN NOW  I was on Bart when I called and upon arrival a table was waiting for us! A few other groups were waiting outside for brunch but we just sat right down. END
BEGIN NOW  (if only SF places were like this. END
BEGIN NOW ). END
BEGIN NOW Walking up, we saw some people with the bloody marys and they looked incredible! I personally don't like bloody marys but my friend said it wasn't quite as spicy as she would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW  The pickled veggies and the bacon that come with it were delicious though!. END
BEGIN NOW I got the french toast with apples and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW  The toast was pretty fluffy and thoroughly soaked in syrup. END
BEGIN NOW  In fact, the toast was in a pool of syrup so the last few bites were a bit too soggy. END
BEGIN NOW  I also wished there had been more apples and walnuts because that would have added more texture to the dish. END
BEGIN NOW Chop Bar is a great spot for brunch and lunch. END
BEGIN NOW Brunch: 4 stars, Lunch: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  Dinner: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW Although the brunch menu may look like your typical brunch, they really do a great job. END
BEGIN NOW  The quality of ingredients and the flavors are on point. END
BEGIN NOW  The chilaquiles and french toast are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Lunch is also good too but the few times I've been I wasn't too impressed with their menu. END
BEGIN NOW  One item I really enjoyed was their clams. END
BEGIN NOW  My mom had the pork banh-mi and I wasn't too impressed when I tried it. END
BEGIN NOW  It was expensive and made with great quality ingredients I'm sure, but it didn't beat a $4 banh mi I could get in chinatown. END
BEGIN NOW  I also tried the oxtail poutine which was a little too saucy and it needed either more fries or bread on the side to dip into it. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious but I couldn't just slurp the gravy on its own. END
BEGIN NOW All in all, the service is great and there is a great amount of parking near by. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is nice with indoor and outdoor seating. END
BEGIN NOW  The last time I went Festus Ezeli from the warriors was sitting near me. END
BEGIN NOW  I was pretty star struck and decided not to disturb him, but that was a cool memory of this place! (:. END
BEGIN NOW Wanted to try the Bloody Mary ($8) at this place since I heard it was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I had never had one before, so I figured I might as well start with a good one. END
BEGIN NOW  Needless to say, I don't think I'm the Bloody Mary type. END
BEGIN NOW  It had a nice flavor, but it's too spicy and more like a meal in a glass (I'm also not a fan of milkshakes with my food). END
BEGIN NOW  I do recommend getting it with bacon ($2 extra), as it's some of the best I've had. END
BEGIN NOW The food came to us oddly quick. END
BEGIN NOW  Within minutes. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the asparagus appetizer ($11). END
BEGIN NOW  It came with a poached egg and some sort of green sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Flavor was nice, but it was a little salty. END
BEGIN NOW  Not too salty, just a little. END
BEGIN NOW I got the Chop Bar Burger for my meal ($14) with Swiss cheese ($1 extra, but some add-ons were $2 extra). END
BEGIN NOW  Meat-wise, the burger was top notch. END
BEGIN NOW  And I liked the bun, too. END
BEGIN NOW  Other than that, there weren't a whole lot of other flavors going on. END
BEGIN NOW  Just the bacon, which merely added to the saltiness of the patty. END
BEGIN NOW  The Swiss cheese and the aioli were non-existent. END
BEGIN NOW  I even asked for more aioli for extra taste. END
BEGIN NOW  It only barely helped. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't a bad burger by any means. END
BEGIN NOW  It was just too reliant on the bold meat flavor and needed a little more craft. END
BEGIN NOW My dad got the pork confit ($20) with a side of Jo-Jos ($6), which are basically potato wedges. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork was very flavorful, and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW They specialize in meat, and they passed with flying colors in that department. END
BEGIN NOW  It's just that they tend to add a lot of ingredients that merely sound good on paper without truly complimenting each other. END
BEGIN NOW Also, this place is a tad bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW  $8 for the Bloody Mary isn't bad, but the food is just too expensive for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had better for less. END
BEGIN NOW But most importantly, this place was good enough to make me want to come back to try their other menu items. END
BEGIN NOW We heard the meatloaf was good, but I guess we'll save that for next time. END
BEGIN NOW Try ordering ANYTHING off the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  These guys have ZERO interest in giving a customer a satisfying experience. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel bad because the chefs are working hard trying to make amazing food and it's being served by these indifferent "hipster barrista" types. END
BEGIN NOW Damn disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW Sunday brunch was most excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated fairly quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  The staff was incredibly attentive and nice. END
BEGIN NOW  All smiles!. END
BEGIN NOW The French toast is a big win. END
BEGIN NOW  Custard-dipped brioche with candied walnuts, apples and whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW  It was to die for. END
BEGIN NOW Other big wins was the chiliquiles with chorizo and salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW  A really big portion. END
BEGIN NOW The side of bacon was meh. END
BEGIN NOW  It was actually one slice of bacon cut in three chunks. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't particularly tasty and $5 which was a bit of a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee was most excellent and local. END
BEGIN NOW Will definitely visit this place again. END
BEGIN NOW I love that this place lets you call ahead for brunch to put your name down on the list. END
BEGIN NOW  I cannot appreciate that enough. END
BEGIN NOW  I oftentimes will avoid brunch in SF because I don't want to wait over an hour after I get there just to get seated. END
BEGIN NOW I tried the bloody mary "baconized". END
BEGIN NOW  I saw other people with the bloody mary as we walked in and decided right then that I had to get it. END
BEGIN NOW  It looked like a pretty standard bloody mary, but with bacon on top (I know, right?!)!! Not sure how much I actually liked the bacon in it, but it was definitely an interesting twist. END
BEGIN NOW  The bloody mary itself was decent, a little on the tomato-y side, not super spicy. END
BEGIN NOW The menu is not super extensive, but has your standard brunch options. END
BEGIN NOW  Between me and my friends, we ordered a few different things. END
BEGIN NOW 1) Pastrami hash (with poached eggs) - I had this, it was pretty tasty, nothing particularly special about it, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I enjoyed it, though it was more like chunks of pastrami and potato, rather than a hash really. END
BEGIN NOW 2) Pork belly frittata - The pork belly in the frittata looked like it had a good fat to lean ratio (which is important!) but wasn't seasoned quite enough. END
BEGIN NOW 3) Eggs cazuela. END
BEGIN NOW 4) French toast. END
BEGIN NOW Chop Bar is the good Oakland, the kind you want to show off to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW It's located in a cool loft space in Jack London, within walking distance from the Blue Bottle flagship location. END
BEGIN NOW  The wait on a Sunday afternoon teeters around 20 mins, which isn't all that bad in comparison to some spots in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW The menu features all kinds of new American and California inspired plates. END
BEGIN NOW  Their burger is a serious force to be reckoned with. END
BEGIN NOW  This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  Let me lay this out for you. END
BEGIN NOW  the bun is somewhere between sourdough and a pastry. END
BEGIN NOW  It is remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW  The hamburger patty is so thick and so juicy and as you eat this thing, the juices dribble out and the soft part of the bun soaks it up. END
BEGIN NOW  Thick, hickory smoked slices of bacon and avocado adorn this creation. END
BEGIN NOW  Make sure to add cheese too because, holy crap, the melted swiss cheese on this thing was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  I asked for medium rare and received a very well done patty, but I was too hungry to do anything about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Kind of a bummer, so make sure your waiter knows you're not playing around. END
BEGIN NOW They only have 4 beers on tap, none of which is a pilsner, and all their taps were broken when I went. END
BEGIN NOW  Basically their only downfall is being a beer buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW I feel like Chop Bar can do no wrong. END
BEGIN NOW I've had dinner here twice, and stopped in one time for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW   While it can get kind of loud in this small, intimate space, you'll probably be too busy savoring the amazing food to want to talk to whoever else you're with. END
BEGIN NOW   Just keeping it 100. END
BEGIN NOW Their agua frescas ($3) are, well, refreshing. END
BEGIN NOW   If you want something other than water, but that won't drive your BAC up, this is a great choice. END
BEGIN NOW   I had a watermelon one for dinner and it had the faintest hint of lime in it, too. END
BEGIN NOW   Even with the striking blend of flavors, I think it blended pretty well with the pork chop I ordered that evening. END
BEGIN NOW For lunch, I opted for their pork Bolognese with pac mac noodles by Baia Pasta (shop. END
BEGIN NOW baiapasta. END
BEGIN NOW com/produ…) - $18. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're not in the mood for meat, there's also a seasonal vegetable option, too. END
BEGIN NOW   With a generous portion of shaved parmesan on top, this dish really hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Just the right ratio of noodles to sauce, with plenty of chunks of savory ground pork. END
BEGIN NOW The first time I had dinner here, I went for the oxtail poutine - $20 (french fries, oxtail gravy, Fiscalini cheddar). END
BEGIN NOW   I might or might not have licked the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW The second time I went for dinner, I ordered the pork chop and chose kale and mashed potatoes as my side dishes (you also have the option of going with their mac and cheese) - $24. END
BEGIN NOW   Their mashed potatoes were just too good. END
BEGIN NOW   I honestly want to ask them to double up on the mashed potatoes next time. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe i'll just beg for a bowl as my entree. END
BEGIN NOW   The kale was cooked perfectly with onions and garlic, too, and I definitely felt less guilty eating them. END
BEGIN NOW  but the mashed potatoes!!!  As for the pork chop, goodness. END
BEGIN NOW   There was a slight crust that formed all around while the interior remained tender and moist. END
BEGIN NOW   It came in a pool of gravy that complimented it nicely, too, not salty or gelatinous as some gravies can be. END
BEGIN NOW I would definitely be proud to show this gem of a gastropub to friends and family. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe next time I'll try some appetizers and desserts, too. END
BEGIN NOW We came here for brunch on Mother's Day , we called about 30 mins ahead and was seated almost right away. END
BEGIN NOW  The food arrived quickly and the server was great. END
BEGIN NOW  We got the pork hash , the eggs Benedict and eggs Benedict with crab and the torta. END
BEGIN NOW  All the food was perfect and cooked wonderfully. END
BEGIN NOW  The torta was almost like a banh mi fusion but I'm not complaining , I probably wouldn't call it a torta but it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The crab eggs Benedict tasted amazing , they were really generous with the crab and came with a generous side of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  Of course I can't forget about the hot sauce , they had cholula and a house made sauce that was really smokey and delicious but pretty spicy. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't wait to come back again. END
BEGIN NOW This place is eehhhh. END
BEGIN NOW  The price we paid was definitely not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW  2 entrees and a coffee and orange juice cost us about $40! The French toast was so soggy. END
BEGIN NOW  My husband ordered the pork belly hash. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't even pork belly more like small tiny pieces of bacon and there's no hash! It was just home style potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  Not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW  Go over by lake Merritt for way better brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW come to Portal's Queer Beer Wednesday every week! The sliders on the happy hour menu are my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW UPDATE: I have been coming to every QBW for over a year! The fried chicken sliders are a welcome addition to the before 5:00 "happy (hour) meal" menu, and I'm not sorry to see the cheese sauce go from the fries either. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal's rotating menu of craft beers has taught me a lot about beer and about my taste too. END
BEGIN NOW  Ask for Melvin. END
BEGIN NOW  He's the best!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is pretty neat. END
BEGIN NOW  I came in for lunch on a beautiful afternoon and sat on the outdoor patio overlooking the lake. END
BEGIN NOW There was a large party of 12 requiring the attn of most of the wait staff (3 servers). END
BEGIN NOW  Service was very slow from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW  Not a place for a quick bite or lunch if you're on the clock. END
BEGIN NOW The food was very good. END
BEGIN NOW  Quality ingredients and large portions. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the Garlic bread meatball sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW  The mini burgers and chilaquiles looked good and I hope to come back for those. END
BEGIN NOW Overall a good spot, but service was shoddy -- no refills or checkups. END
BEGIN NOW Came here for dinner with a few friends. END
BEGIN NOW   We shared the vegetarian garbage bread, which was quite delish. END
BEGIN NOW   The garbage bread was very hearty, and it definitely did not need meat. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW   For myself, I ordered 2 mini burgers in fried chicken and turkey, both were quite filling and tasty, though not as exciting as our garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW Overall the atmosphere was a nice small pub, great for a couple of friends. END
BEGIN NOW   The outside area is also very cute, definitely want to return for brunch with mimosas!  Will update my review upon return!. END
BEGIN NOW I'm completely in love with this place. END
BEGIN NOW  The food, the people, the beer, and seating!! Very close to the lake with outdoor seating (there's indoor seating as well). END
BEGIN NOW  They have 3 tvs inside, and one shared bathroom (the only drawback). END
BEGIN NOW I love the beer selection here, only problem I have is that there's a high turn over of the beer. END
BEGIN NOW  As soon as you fall in love with one there's one to replace it. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is great, try the cheese knots. END
BEGIN NOW  They're basically like homemade mozzarella sticks and they will change your life on how you see mozzarella sticks. END
BEGIN NOW  The wings are great as well. END
BEGIN NOW  Not bad prices. END
BEGIN NOW There's parking all around. END
BEGIN NOW  When you sit outside you have views of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Very nice decor both indoor and outdoor. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW  They do have vegan and veg options!. END
BEGIN NOW It is definitely worth the (honestly not bad) wait for a table on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW  I was so relaxed with a beer and good food, staring out at the breezy lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Thank God out of their decently-sized list of beers on tap, there was at least one sour. END
BEGIN NOW  We just barely missed bottomless mimosas (I believe they're done at 1 pm?), damn. END
BEGIN NOW We shared the pork belly salad and garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  If it sounds like we were eating light, we absolutely were not. END
BEGIN NOW  The garbage bread sneaks up on you, and all the fixings inside are going to make you groan after it settles in twenty or so minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious in the moment, though. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork belly salad was average, and a bit overdressed/salty. END
BEGIN NOW Parking was fortunately easy to find all around, and seriously, thank God for the location. END
BEGIN NOW  We had to walk it off for an hour around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW Portal is like. END
BEGIN NOW one of those places where you stumble across on accident. END
BEGIN NOW  But at the end of the day you realize the encounter was supposed to happen. END
BEGIN NOW  Some may even say "divine intervention" well at least for those into bar food with a light sophisticated twist. END
BEGIN NOW  And those that like local beers, hoppy ales, and micro brews. END
BEGIN NOW  And a nice view of Lake Merrit from the patio. END
BEGIN NOW  So far Portal has a few things right. END
BEGIN NOW  Allow me to tell you a little more. END
BEGIN NOW  Here is my review of Portal. END
BEGIN NOW 4/21/16. END
BEGIN NOW My constant Yelping seems to have rubbed on aome of my friends! I decided to stay and take in Oakland after going to my guard card class earlier on in the day. END
BEGIN NOW  I had booked marked so many places in Oakland and didn't think I was going to get to visit any of them until my buddy contacted me after seeing me check in on "Facebook" in the "City of Oakland" he was like "Yo dude you in my hood, I been checking out some cool gastropubs on Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  Let's check out this place called Portal!" I was stoked because I one didn't know my homie "Yelped" and two because I didn't realize I had bookedmarked it already. END
BEGIN NOW  So I was totally down. END
BEGIN NOW  He swooped me up and we set off. END
BEGIN NOW It was nice to see a few places I've bookedmarked in Oakland as we drove throughout downtown and the Lake Merrit area. END
BEGIN NOW  But our minds were set, we wanted to step this "Portal" and have some good beer and bar fair. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice to see Lake Merrit as kinda the. END
BEGIN NOW "Landmark" if you were trying to find this place and another east bay restarunt that's creating a buzz (rockin crawfish oakland) which is like. END
BEGIN NOW across the street. END
BEGIN NOW  But back to the reason for this review. END
BEGIN NOW Portal!. END
BEGIN NOW Service - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW Food - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW Beer 100/5 :D. END
BEGIN NOW The Warriors played this day so this place went from like empty to packed house in like a 10 min span. END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention my NY Yankees were playing as well so. END
BEGIN NOW I was indeed having a great day. END
BEGIN NOW  My homie and I started with some 805's (beer) with bbq and hot wings for starters. END
BEGIN NOW  Of you've had 805 before, its a pretty good light beer made here in cali, it really compliments light foods in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW  The wings were prefect! Fried just right, the sauces were just enough and not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW  Plus the prices were pretty good on the food and beer here as well (see my my pics for prices and menu shots!) oh. END
BEGIN NOW and if you get a pitcher of the "Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme 11% abv" be prepared to take a "Uber or Lyft" home :D. END
BEGIN NOW Will I go back?. END
BEGIN NOW In a heartbeat!. END
BEGIN NOW In conclusion, this place is perfect for hanging out, happy hour, dates, shenanigans and just chillaxing. END
BEGIN NOW  And with the Patio, I'm sure the ambiance at night is just pretty ill with Lake Merrit as the backdrop. END
BEGIN NOW  I say if you've bookedmarked this place before, I would say give it a go! You will like it here! Of not. END
BEGIN NOW you just hard to please! :D As always yelp your own experience. END
BEGIN NOW Oakland you have a winner! My first time at this place & I loved everything about this hipster spot. END
BEGIN NOW We got there right at 10am when they opened. END
BEGIN NOW  I can see where the wait can be a little long especially if you want to sit on the patio (which has a gorgeous view of Lake Merit). END
BEGIN NOW Everyone at the table had a little bit of everything. END
BEGIN NOW  The Migas, The Drunk Bread, Guacamole, French Toast. END
BEGIN NOW  We loved all the food. END
BEGIN NOW  I will definitely be back next time I am in town. END
BEGIN NOW Oh yeah. END
BEGIN NOW cannot forget the bottomless Mimosas!. END
BEGIN NOW On the outskirts of Lake Merrit, you will find that this little pub/beer garden pleasantly awaits you. END
BEGIN NOW  You really can't beat Portal's back patio. END
BEGIN NOW  Especially because, the inside of Portal isn't huge - think a few tables and a bar. END
BEGIN NOW  That back patio, tho. END
BEGIN NOW  Communal seating - so, think beer garden steez. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been a few times at wonky hours, think 3:30 looking for brunch and sadly, they stick to dining hours for food, although you can always order drinks and items like fries and such. END
BEGIN NOW  Another huge pro about Portal is their beer list. END
BEGIN NOW  Craft beer aficionnados, you will not be disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW I've had their bloody mary and it's good, not the best, but real solid. END
BEGIN NOW  As always, more accoutrements, please. END
BEGIN NOW  And to my surprise, no vodka in this bad boy, soju only. END
BEGIN NOW  Just an fyi if you happen to be a BM purist. END
BEGIN NOW  They do offer some bottomless mimosa deals during weekend brunch hours, but you'll have to go inquire about prices. END
BEGIN NOW Most recently for lunch, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my cobb salad and the surprise happy ending. END
BEGIN NOW  No, not that one, ya scumbags. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a delicious, almost pizza like dough that serves as the bottom layer of the salad. END
BEGIN NOW  Score. END
BEGIN NOW  A pretty hefty salad that isn't cheap at $14, but quite filling and freshly filled with juicy chicken, crisp bacon, eggs and so on; pretty much the most unhealthy salad on earth. END
BEGIN NOW  Yep, that's me. END
BEGIN NOW  Other items that piqued my fancy: the burger, the garbage bread, the meatball sub and those fries looked mighty fine. END
BEGIN NOW Go. END
BEGIN NOW  Drink beer. END
BEGIN NOW  Enjoy that Oakland sunshine and eat!. END
BEGIN NOW I've  not been in awhile they've been pretty busy which is awesome for them, so I went in today and it's just gotten soo casual in service to a point of rude. END
BEGIN NOW The glass was dirty and the server was poignantly rude by rolling he's eyes slightly when asked for a new one ya know what, I left,I've had enough of Portals slight distain. END
BEGIN NOW  I adored portal when they first set foot in the space wasabi once was but now sits a pissy example of they're former selves,polite cool,easy,clean selves. END
BEGIN NOW Now it seems like any other place overblown semi ok food staff who seems put out by the customers of which I should add wasn't at capacity so I was surprised at the very lack of any service. END
BEGIN NOW  I've actually wanted to say this last bit for a while about the food the last few times we'd gone in it just seemed lacking undercooked food mostly. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm bummed I really did like this place. END
BEGIN NOW We got to the restaurant 20 minutes before it opened for saturday brunch and there was already a huge line. END
BEGIN NOW  I think a lot of the line is for those who want to sit outside on a beautiful sunny Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW  And even with the line, they'll offer to get your brunch drink started. END
BEGIN NOW Service was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I remembered the name of the fella that served us but he was incredibly helpful, patient and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  Portions are HUGE so order accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW We go the bottomless mimosa and their pours are SERIOUS. END
BEGIN NOW  it's pretty much champagne with a tiny splash of OJ. END
BEGIN NOW  Seth Rogan looking bartender: you are on point. END
BEGIN NOW  My faves in terms of food:. END
BEGIN NOW Garbage Bread- it's a pizza burito. END
BEGIN NOW  get the meat one. END
BEGIN NOW  get it. END
BEGIN NOW  eat it. END
BEGIN NOW  you're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffed Challah French Toast- I thought i was done eating but my arm was still shoveling it in my face. END
BEGIN NOW Tempeh Hash- we got it with poached eggs and goat cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  perfect recommendation. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely will be coming back to enjoy the rest of the menu and the ambience outside!. END
BEGIN NOW The door is an actual porthole. END
BEGIN NOW  Talk about puns!!. END
BEGIN NOW I actually had a difficult time opening the door because it was so heavy lol and then I started questioning if that was even was the door in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW  To my embarrassment, it was! You just need to pull a little harder then normal. END
BEGIN NOW  I was visiting a friend and local native at Portal for a quick beer and a much needed catch up. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated right away and the place had a lot of character! They have a wide selection of beer and wine and a phenomenal happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW The server was cheery and helpful--he recommended the steak which was cooked to perfection! It was so tender and the seasoning was nothing like I've ever had before. END
BEGIN NOW  My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It's definitely a steak I will never forget. END
BEGIN NOW  We had some veggies on the side which were asparagus and several different types of squash that were in season--a perfect pairing with the steak. END
BEGIN NOW  The meal was very filling and we ended up sitting there talking for hours. END
BEGIN NOW It started getting busy around 8pm and people were rolling in for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a fantastic place if you live nearby and want to grab drinks after work. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm so jealous that there isn't one near me in Sacramento! Their employees are friendly and made spot-on recommendations about the food and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Alright Portal, you surprised me last night. END
BEGIN NOW  I've eaten there seeeeeeveral times and was meh about the food. END
BEGIN NOW  But last night, my ravioli was #onpoint though. END
BEGIN NOW  Dude ate the meatball sammy which came with a heaaaaalthy portion of greens. END
BEGIN NOW  Thanks for keeping it healthy. END
BEGIN NOW  You always have an excellent selection of beers. END
BEGIN NOW  While neither of us had any of the Brewery doing the tap takeover, I love that you were a supporter of beer week. END
BEGIN NOW The three stars because in all of my other experiences there, the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW  So perhaps the dinner entrees are just better than the brunch? I'll have to go again before I can leave a higher rating for that. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, it closes at 11 and there's not a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I understand but hey. END
BEGIN NOW sometimes I just need a shot of vodka. END
BEGIN NOW  ;). END
BEGIN NOW But it's a cute spot to go and have a few brews with the homies yo. END
BEGIN NOW  With a large patio and hopefully running heat lamps on cold days, it's a nice spot to go near the lake or after Rockin Crawfish. END
BEGIN NOW I learned a very important lesson during my visit to Portal Restaurant: never visit an establishment that has multiple signs posted on the front of the building advertising the need and higher for chefs. END
BEGIN NOW  After a twenty minute wait to be seated on an early Saturday night, we were guided to four seats at a community table. END
BEGIN NOW  I think the draw of Portal or many is the large outdoor patio with views of Lake Merritt, is truly is picturesque. END
BEGIN NOW  The adult beverage list is fairly average for the area (although they claim to be a "beer garden" their selection and simply lack of beer menus makes me question this claim), their dinner menu is set with several appetizer and entree items but is not extensive. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered sharing plates for four people which included:. END
BEGIN NOW *ricotta bites: as delicious as they sound, fried on the outside, cheesy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Portion came with four bites and a marinara sauce (sauce to bites ratio was off, request more sauce if you ever see your waitress!). END
BEGIN NOW *cesar salad: OK, covered with parmesan cheese and house-made croutons, large portion but lacked flavor and dressing to lettuce ratio was off. END
BEGIN NOW *brussels sprouts: Good, but damn, I feel like a good home-chef should be able to whip up some taste brussels, and these aren't any better than what I can make a home. END
BEGIN NOW *garbage bread: Best part of the meal, hands down! Tasty, flavorful, crispy and chewy: this is their signature dish. END
BEGIN NOW  It's served with a the same marinara sauce sauce as the ricotta bites and a overly powerful pesto sauce that I'd recommend skipping. END
BEGIN NOW  Try to get extra marinara sauce when the food is dropped off. END
BEGIN NOW *chicken wings: This was the most disappointing part of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW  We received our chicken wings (granted, our dishes were coming out in stages, so they weren't rushing to prepare everything at the same time) and the chicken was RAW. END
BEGIN NOW  We pointed it out to our waitress, she said "yes, that's raw!" and returned it to the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  Not acknowledgment more from her, no visit from the chef or manager, simply embarrassing and a terrible way to conduct business. END
BEGIN NOW  The only acknowledgement from our waitress (who practically abandoned our table!) was if we'd like to order something else instead. END
BEGIN NOW  The chicken wings weren't included on the check but our replacement item was. END
BEGIN NOW *garlic fries: (replacement for chicken) very lackluster, they're the a-typical garlic fry of every restaurant out there. END
BEGIN NOW I believe that Portal has been nights, but I'd stay far away until they have consistency in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  If you see that they're hiring chefs, RUN!. END
BEGIN NOW Coming for a weekend brunch? Expect a wait - everyone wants to eat here! We came here on a rainy day and even then, there was a long line of people waiting for some brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW PARKING: Street parking - plenty! We were able to find street parking no problem. END
BEGIN NOW SEATING: Indoor & outdoor seating available (but when it's raining, only indoor seating available). END
BEGIN NOW  Not very many tables inside which is probably why there's a long line. END
BEGIN NOW BAR: There's a bar also! You can grab a drink while you're waiting for your table. END
BEGIN NOW  Weekend brunch calls for AYCD mimosas from opening til 1pm!. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD: Soooo many great options! I had the Portal Benedict (you can add ham, bacon, or avocado for an extra $3). END
BEGIN NOW  You won't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu! Other highlights are the Corned Beef Hash. END
BEGIN NOW  We're in to try the Garbage Bread next time - we didn't want any leftovers this time. END
BEGIN NOW A-okay Portal! We'll be back :) Maybe on a sunny day so we can enjoy some brunch and a stroll around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW Portal is a gem in Oakland! It's located right next to Lake Merritt and from the outside seating, you can get a pretty nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here during an off hour between lunch and dinner! The waiter was super nice and accommodating, letting us pick wherever we wanted to sit outside. END
BEGIN NOW We started off by ordering two beers. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a pretty good variety of standard mixes and other interesting flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  The waiter helped make recommendations depending on our tastes of dark, light, and so on. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the meat garbage bread (Yelp told me to, so I had to!!) and the garlic bread meatball sub. END
BEGIN NOW  The meatballs were recommended but I love garlic bread so I figured why not mix the two of those together! The garlic bread meatball sub also came with a side salad. END
BEGIN NOW  Those two orders were more than enough for the two of us and we actually had some leftover. END
BEGIN NOW I definitely recommend the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't let the name fool you. END
BEGIN NOW it's definitely not garbage! The garbage bread was a treasure. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the cheese melted on top and the inside was stuffed with delicious goodies. END
BEGIN NOW  The meatball garlic sub was good but not incredibly impressive. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe it's because I'm not too big of a fan of meatballs to begin with. END
BEGIN NOW  It was definitely good but just wasn't as mind blowing as the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW I plan on coming back to Portal for brunch sometime so I heard there's a great unlimited mimosa option and they have an amazing menu for breakfast! This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat before a baseball game (which we did)!. END
BEGIN NOW I can't think of one bad time here at Portal. END
BEGIN NOW  It's always a good time! From brunch to dinner, all times of the day are great at this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Love brunch on the patio because of all the natural sunlight that fills the backyard and love dinner on the patio too because they crank up the jams and it's beautifully lit with string lights to set the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW Recs: Lunch- herbed garlic fries are incredible (what's in that frying oil?!), Turkey Mini Burger is my fave out all their sliders. END
BEGIN NOW Brunch- must try their polenta!. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner- Turkey Meatballs, no need to add pasta if you're looking for a carb-less entree, so hearty and deliciously tender. END
BEGIN NOW  Fried Brussel Sprouts, the smell is intoxicating. END
BEGIN NOW I missed out on the bottomless mimosa but glad I ordered Mr. END
BEGIN NOW  Pickles! Portal pickle their own garnishes and boy did they all go well with the spicy drink!. END
BEGIN NOW We came around 11 on a Saturday and wait was about 20 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  This was right before the brunch rush and one of the Warriors playoffs! Would have love to enjoy their outside patio which was spacious but pretty exposed to the sun. END
BEGIN NOW  So we sat at the bar with our awesome female bartender/server, enjoyed our food and watched the Warriors kicked the Rockets booties till they were red!. END
BEGIN NOW Ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW 1. END
BEGIN NOW  House coffee - strong and good. END
BEGIN NOW 2. END
BEGIN NOW  Mr. END
BEGIN NOW  Pickles - obsessed with it. END
BEGIN NOW 3. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal Benedict - never had it on grilled polenta before so it was a unique taste. END
BEGIN NOW  Good but very filling. END
BEGIN NOW 4. END
BEGIN NOW  BF and I were so full but decided to be pigs and stuffed ourselves more with the Stuffed Challah French toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Also good but there was something else other then the ricotta filling in between those bread. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure if it was banana or plantain. END
BEGIN NOW which I'm not a big fan of. END
BEGIN NOW Other then that, for a bar that serves food. END
BEGIN NOW Portal got my vote as a go-to spot for brunch or just a drink on their patio!. END
BEGIN NOW Everything about this place is Meh. END
BEGIN NOW The food, service, ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW  It's all meh. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sure hipsters love this place. END
BEGIN NOW Had my birthday dinner here on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW  We were greeted and sat quickly. END
BEGIN NOW We tried the Sonoma bourbon cider ($6) prairie bomb beer ($12) for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The cider came in a bottle along with a glass. END
BEGIN NOW  It was okay, not as good as I had hopped. END
BEGIN NOW  The prairie bomb was a dark beer. END
BEGIN NOW  I normally hate dark beer due to the bitterness. END
BEGIN NOW  This one was great. END
BEGIN NOW  We took down the name so we can find it later. END
BEGIN NOW For dinner we ordered the meat garbage bread ($15) 2- sliders ($13) and BBQ frites ($8) When the food came I noticed the sliders weren't the ones we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server didn't come by for some time so we ate the garbage bread which was fabulous and the fries were great with the dipping sauces. END
BEGIN NOW  When I told our server about the slider error I asked to just have it removed from the bill since we were too stuffed to eat anymore. END
BEGIN NOW The server came back with our bill and said the manager gave a little discount ($3. END
BEGIN NOW 90) due to the mix up. END
BEGIN NOW  That was a nice gesture. END
BEGIN NOW The atmosphere has dim lighting, nice outdoor area and bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Hipster kind of place,. END
BEGIN NOW No hard alcohol available. END
BEGIN NOW  Cocktails are made with suju. END
BEGIN NOW  Beer and wine available. END
BEGIN NOW Here's the deal: I hate waiting in long lines. END
BEGIN NOW  In my experience, to avoid that and still eat breakfast here, you basically have to get here and wait for them to open. END
BEGIN NOW  For me, that means getting my butt out of bed and being outside before 8am on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW BUT, here is what I will say. END
BEGIN NOW  they're great). END
BEGIN NOW 4 stars instead of 5 because I've had a couple misses here. END
BEGIN NOW  I think it was when they had first opened up. END
BEGIN NOW  In any case, I think most folks will find something they'll like on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW 've had pretty much everything on their menu, and every item is so great and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Um, delicious coffee (Highwire), delish micheladas, delish food and pastries. END
BEGIN NOW  Obviously it sucks to wait in line, but whatever- this is the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW  Get used to it. END
BEGIN NOW  I like to get there early and beat the later crowd. END
BEGIN NOW And please send whoever designed the space my way--beautiful!!!. END
BEGIN NOW Weekday late brunch: Nailed it. END
BEGIN NOW This spot is a total gem, nestled in the Laurel District serving up some really upscale, but down home eats. END
BEGIN NOW  Mostly breakfast, but don't fret, they do have some lunch options as well. END
BEGIN NOW  All their breads and pastries are made in house, they serve organic eggs and all meats are antibiotic and hormone free. END
BEGIN NOW  My health does matter, thank you very much!. END
BEGIN NOW My goat cheese omelet ($13) was what dreams are made of: a fluffy omelet oozing with goat cheese, snap peas, asparagus, garlic and spring onions. END
BEGIN NOW  I inhaled it. END
BEGIN NOW  In addition to this perfect egg dish, were some crispy potatoes, salad and perfectly toasted homemade bread with house made jam. END
BEGIN NOW  DAYUUUUMMMMM. END
BEGIN NOW  Writing this review is taking back to pure eating bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee was solid and prices are fair for portion sizes and service was lovely. END
BEGIN NOW  Granted, it wasn't busy at all, but this spot is a neighborhood joint and service is to match. END
BEGIN NOW  I can imagine some frustration during those weekend hours, but well worth the wait; I loved everything about Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW Items I will be returning for: strawberry cream cheese danish, the beef hash and that cubano sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW  Sign me up. END
BEGIN NOW A new and not-so-much longer hidden gem in Oakland's Laurel District that is the perfect place for a weekend brunch on one of those sunny days that Oakland is famous for! I am a real fan of this great neighborhood diner where everything is homemade from their pastries to their jams in addition to their classic dishes for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  And Sequoia Diner lives up the hype that's been expressed from so many reviews and images posted from my fellow Yelpers!. END
BEGIN NOW I actually found out about Sequoia Diner due to the fact it seemed like it was on Yelp's "New Businesses in East Bay" for an eternity! It actually opened about a year ago, replacing the long-standing Full House Cafe, by a local husband and wife duo who wanted to stay loyal to the neighborhood with their seasonal brunch classics served all morning until mid-afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW  There is so much buzz for Sequoia Diner that wait times can be quite long for brunch and parking on MacArthur Avenue and the surrounding area can be quite dicey. END
BEGIN NOW  So plan ahead it you don't mind waiting. END
BEGIN NOW  Luckily, I had friends who were eager enough to get there early and put our names down and patient enough for me to get there just a wee bit late. END
BEGIN NOW Once we were sat in their patent leather booths, we each knew what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW  (I had been doing enough research from my fellow Yelper's images and reviews to know what to order and what to pass up. END
BEGIN NOW ) We knew we all had to get the highly-recommended Pecan Sticky Buns and at $3. END
BEGIN NOW 75 each it's a good deal, so much so, the three of us ordered two buns to share. END
BEGIN NOW  I found them not too sweet or sticky with the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and topped with an abundance of chopped pecans. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a perfect accompaniment to your coffee. END
BEGIN NOW As for my main dish, I knew that some Sequoia Diner plates were heavier than others, but I also wanted to taste some of the best and unique dishes that they have to offer to get a read on how they prepare their meals here. END
BEGIN NOW  So I went with the Country Breakfast with its biscuit and gravy, collared greens, hash browns and two eggs made to order. END
BEGIN NOW  Although obviously heavy, my dish was solid, I especially loved the creamy gravy, warm biscuit, and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW  You could tell with the first bite how much homemade goodness was put into your meal. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite being constantly busy, the service for the most part was attentive and there was constant turnover of the tables and counter-tops, made the flow of service that much more pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW Sequoia Diner is your classic mom-and-pop owned and operated American breakfast joint with modern day sustainable and locavore sensibilities. END
BEGIN NOW  Their eclectic menu makes me want to come back for more, everything sounds so familiar yet so unique that it seems like you can't go wrong. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't wait to return one day to see how Sequoia Diner continues to build upon their success in a loyal and foodie loving neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW I never loved brunch much, always made me feel comatose and heavy afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW   SD has the sweetspot between comfort and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW If you're ordering to-go, it's a good idea to call ahead, it took upwards of 30 minutes to get my order, there isn't much seating for those waiting, I ordered a coffee to hold me over while waiting, comes in super cute beige/brown cups, reminds me of the 70s and 80s. END
BEGIN NOW   Such a pleasant throwback to a simpler time. END
BEGIN NOW LOVED the Red Flannel Hash. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfectly poached eggs, kraut to cut the richness, cubes of al dente beets and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   They don't take substitutions. END
BEGIN NOW   I wanted to swap out one of the eggs for some chard, but had to order it separately. END
BEGIN NOW   Sour cream was mysteriously left off - perfect, I was going to omit it anyways. END
BEGIN NOW Homemade sourdough toast were a nice counterpart to the meal. END
BEGIN NOW   Comes pre-buttered. END
BEGIN NOW If you're there after 11AM, there are additional items you can order, got an asparagus, pea, arugula salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Sounds simple but the details were there: toasted almonds, slices of orange/blood orange, kumquats and pickled green beans. END
BEGIN NOW   Wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW Will be my mid-day treat going forward. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything seasoned well. END
BEGIN NOW   Carefully and expertly prepared. END
BEGIN NOW   So nice to have this quality of food available. END
BEGIN NOW   4 items: $35 including tax/tip. END
BEGIN NOW I love brunch but I don't always love brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW   So, it is no surprise that my hunt for the perfect local brunch spot has extended well into my second year in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm pleased to report the search is over. END
BEGIN NOW   Sequoia elevates humble breakfast staples -- not with a bunch of unnecessary frippery -- but by paying exquisite attention to the details. END
BEGIN NOW   Baked items are made in house including the incredible fresh biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW   The menu rotates with interesting seasonal specials. END
BEGIN NOW   On one visit, the loco moco had an incredibly rich shortrib gravy. END
BEGIN NOW   On the next, appetizers included chicken liver toasts with chicken cracklings and fig jam. END
BEGIN NOW   Good, simple food, presumably inspired by the personal tastes and whims of the chef (as well as the season) and made with heart and smarts. END
BEGIN NOW I don't understand the long wait for this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is good, but not especially amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd say it is pretty normal American food. END
BEGIN NOW  Perhaps my wife and I missed out by not getting any of their baked goods. END
BEGIN NOW When I saw Hazel's pictures from Sequoia Diner less than a month ago, I knew I needed to get myself over here soon. END
BEGIN NOW   Apparently I was not quick enough as word is out and an hour long wait seemed to be the constant on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW Upon arrival, since no one was up front, I grabbed a pen and was about to put my name down on the list but a few seconds later discovered that they have a hostess taking names and got my 1 hour wait estimate. END
BEGIN NOW   They do allow you to buy a coffee to enjoy outside while you wait so this non coffee drinker did the next best thing and ordered a sticky bun to go making the wait more bearable. END
BEGIN NOW   It was love at first bite as it was not overly sweet and enough pecans with each bite. END
BEGIN NOW We were seated within 45 minutes allowing me to digest that sticky bun freeing up stomach space to fully enjoy their breakfast plates. END
BEGIN NOW   I already had my eye on the beef hash with poached eggs which was just a plate of beautiful flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  Slight saltiness of the beef hash paired with the tartness from the pickled cabbage topped with the creaminess of the poached eggs and the final punch of the arugula will have you scraping up every morsel. END
BEGIN NOW   Since hubby didn't realize that the Red Flannel Hash did not already come with meat (bacon can be added for a charge), he did end up polishing off at least 1/3 of my beef hash and slice of my bread to be satisfied (good thing I was pre-fortified with that sticky bun). END
BEGIN NOW   I had a bite of his Red Flannel Hash which had great flavors as well for a vegetarian option but I do prefer the Beef Hash one. END
BEGIN NOW I thought the Coconut Thai Ice Tea was good and smooth with the coconut milk but like Hazel, felt like the tea flavor was way too light. END
BEGIN NOW   I rather use that $4 for another sticky bun!!. END
BEGIN NOW What a dream on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW  Their hours are limited (sad face!) but if you can make it out here for brunch, YOU MUST!!!! Yep, this place is multiple exclamation point good. END
BEGIN NOW  My second visit was this morning at 8 am on the dot (mind you, daylight savings time just happened so it's really like 7 am and it was raining) and there were a few hungry peeps waiting outside to come in. END
BEGIN NOW It is absolutely worth starting every meal here with a pecan sticky bun. END
BEGIN NOW  Warm and fluffy, and most importantly, totally shareable. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm telling you, you cannot be mad about anything in life after eating one of these. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like napping in a field with a hundred lambs. END
BEGIN NOW  And the coffee? Fill 'er up! They frequently make rounds to top you off of the dark, delicious brew. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't strayed from the Country Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  I just can't! Eggs any style, biscuit with gravy, hashbrowns, collard greens. END
BEGIN NOW  I could not design a better breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  I am a serious biscuit snob (they're so simple and yet people somehow ruin the simplicity of it) and I can say, Sequoia rocks the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like the Pat Benatar of biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW  Eventually I will try their huevos rancheros. END
BEGIN NOW The diner is bright, inviting, and has that Northern Oakland vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  They were smart about the design of the tables, where you can easily transition seating from 2 to larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW  However, this place is definitely not huge, so I have no idea how long it would take to accommodate a larger party during prime time. END
BEGIN NOW  Meanwhile, it's a perfect location for my 1:1 time with my besties. END
BEGIN NOW Skip Montclair's subpar spots, and give Sequoia Diner a shot. END
BEGIN NOW I'd had this bookmarked for a while, but ventured into the Laurel District in East Oakland for the first time this morning. END
BEGIN NOW  I was surprised to see that none of my trusted East Bay Yelpers had reviewed this place but was excited to give it a whirl. END
BEGIN NOW We arrived around 8:30 and found the place mostly full, but were able to grab the last available booth with no wait. END
BEGIN NOW  It has that diner charm, with a long bar counter and several booths along the wall. END
BEGIN NOW  This isn't the place to bring a large group, but it is perfectly cozy for 2 or 4. END
BEGIN NOW  There are several adorable waitresses that were super friendly, greeting you on the way in and out, and keeping the coffee coming. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the positive vibe. END
BEGIN NOW I like that they keep the menu relatively simple, with several classics, and a few twists. END
BEGIN NOW  No kids menu here, per se, but my boys were happy with their pastries. END
BEGIN NOW a pecan roll and the strawberry cream cheese danish. END
BEGIN NOW  They stood on their own as a small breakfast, but would be equally nice as a shared starter while you wait on the main event. END
BEGIN NOW I was thrilled with the mushroom and spinach scramble which, like their other egg dishes, come with some perfectly cooked and seasoned potatoes, some excellent sourdough toast, and a small rocket salad. END
BEGIN NOW  Seemingly simple, but it leaves you wondering why you can't do 'em that perfect at home. END
BEGIN NOW The Highwire brewed coffee wasn't my favorite, but it did the trick and my cup was never empty or cold. END
BEGIN NOW All in all, a real winner that will get added to the Sunday rotation!. END
BEGIN NOW I was sold when I saw that they have Pecan Sticky Buns!  I love sticky buns and for some reason, it's really hard to find it in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW   I used to get them at Berkeley Bowl, but they don't have it anymore. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm also very particular about my sticky buns. END
BEGIN NOW   Often the dough is not soft enough, it is too sweet or there is too much cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW   Sequoia Diner's Pecan Sticky Bun is perfect in all respects and the price is right too. END
BEGIN NOW   $3. END
BEGIN NOW 75 for one is quite reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a nice size, so two people can easily share one. END
BEGIN NOW  We ended up ordering one with our breakfast, and I took their last one to go. END
BEGIN NOW   It'll go great with my coffee tomorrow morning!. END
BEGIN NOW We did have other breakfast items as well. END
BEGIN NOW   My husband ordered the Beef Hash dish which came with a couple of perfectly poached eggs, pickled beets, arugula salad and carrots. END
BEGIN NOW   His plate was very colorful, and most importantly, the beef hash was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   He loved it and he was nice enough to let me taste it. END
BEGIN NOW I had the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of sausage. END
BEGIN NOW  As I already had half of a sticky bun, I thought I'd just order a couple of sides and skip a big entree. END
BEGIN NOW   The biscuit was quite large and it was flaky, tender and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW   It came with a nice amount of gravy. END
BEGIN NOW   The gravy was a little under seasoned, so I had to add some salt and pepper on top. END
BEGIN NOW   The sausages were perfect with the Biscuit and Gravy. END
BEGIN NOW   You can tell that the sausages were house made and thankfully they weren't salty. END
BEGIN NOW As for beverages, I ordered Coconut Thai Iced Tea and the hubby had the Decaf Highwire. END
BEGIN NOW   We brew Highwire Coffee at home, so we were happy to see that on their menu. END
BEGIN NOW   I was really glad they use coconut milk for their Thai Iced Tea. END
BEGIN NOW   It was really good, though I'd like to have a stronger tea flavor. END
BEGIN NOW There was a wait when we got there around 10:45. END
BEGIN NOW   We waited for about half hour. END
BEGIN NOW  They pretty much have a constant stream of diners, so expect to wait if you go here on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is very friendly and I really appreciate that everything is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW   We will definitely go back!. END
BEGIN NOW If you're in the neighborhood and the wait isn't crazy, check it out. END
BEGIN NOW We knew there wasn't a full espresso menu so put our names in and got lattes across the street at World Ground. END
BEGIN NOW  It made the wait of about 35 minutes enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW As others have said, there's another significant wait to get your order and it's loud inside but neither were a problem for us. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice not to be rushed and I enjoyed watching the openness of the kitchen prep area. END
BEGIN NOW The blood orange juice was delightfully tart. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm usually partial to big fluffy waffles but I was really digging the thin crispness of theirs. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes were smashed-style and solid. END
BEGIN NOW  The huevos rancheros with chorizo were overpowered by the bold flavor of the sauce but I do appreciate how they make everything in-house, including the meat. END
BEGIN NOW I really enjoyed coming here for their brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Thank goodness I came with friends so that I can taste their dish as well!. END
BEGIN NOW One thing I did not like was that we had to wait for an hour to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW  But then again, what do you expect for Sunday brunch right?!?. END
BEGIN NOW I order their coconut Thai iced tea and I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW  I believe my friend was indifferent about the drink though. END
BEGIN NOW  My hubby got the matcha almond iced latte and I thought it was OK but he liked it. END
BEGIN NOW  He did get less honey in the drink so if he got it the normal way, I probably would have liked it more. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered their Country Breakfast and that was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW  It came with a biscuit and sausage gravy, two eggs, greens, and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  The highlight for this entree was the biscuit since it was so freakin' moist, soft, buttery! I tried my friend's beef hash and I so liked his dish more than mine. END
BEGIN NOW I'd definitely come back here for their pastries, beef hash, and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW Sequoia, the new home of the now long-gone and super mediocre Full House, is a little gem of a hipster haven worth pushing past the throngs of screaming toddlers and hoards of impatient soon-to-be patrons for. END
BEGIN NOW  It's pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Serving up the usual diner fare with their own flare and fancy (and a bit of a price hike, juheard?), Sequoia aims to please by grabbing you in with something you're familiar with and getting a good grip on you with their unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW  I usually storm the joint on a Sunday or Saturday morning with m'ladies, but today's dolo trip offered a more reflective experience and prompted me to step outside of my usual "two eggs and toast with avo on the side" comfort zone. END
BEGIN NOW I was surprised to find when I walked up around 10 A. END
BEGIN NOW M. END
BEGIN NOW  on a Wednesday that the diner already had a significant crowd outside. END
BEGIN NOW  They didn't have pitchforks just yet but they looked like they were hungry enough to turn into an angry mob. END
BEGIN NOW  Luckily, I signed in with the lovely hostess and was at a counter seat within ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  Once seated, I ordered a mimosa and decided today was the day I'd get jiggy with that Red Flannel Hash I had heard so much about and constantly peered over people's heads to get a better look at. END
BEGIN NOW  I also decided to forego the sliced sourdough in favor of a biscuit so I could finally weigh in on those, as I've heard they're pretty good here. END
BEGIN NOW My mimosa was sad and unimpressive, mostly because the orange juice seemed suspect. END
BEGIN NOW  But the Red Flannel Hash and the biscuit both surpassed my expectations! The Red Flannel Hash is one of those textural and flavor landscapes I live for: warm, crunchy, soft and runny meets savory, sweet, tart and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW  The pickled cabbage that comes with the hash is equal parts culinary genius and just damned good pairing for a poached egg and hash combo. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't really get into the sour cream glob on the side but I'm not a sour cream girl. END
BEGIN NOW The biscuit is just as buttery and flaky and scrumptious as you've heard. END
BEGIN NOW  But the nuances of seasonality scalded me: I got stuck with cranberry preserves, which were pretty gross. END
BEGIN NOW  Still, the biscuit remained sweet and resilient in the face of something so bitter, as we all should. END
BEGIN NOW  Life lessons, brought to you by Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW A great new spot for the best breakfast in town!  You gotta be patient though, as there is always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   Just put your name on the list and have a cuppa. END
BEGIN NOW Farm fresh greens and in house biscuits can't be beat!  I have tried the country breakfast and the Benedict - both excellent!  The potatoes are amazing and crispy _ you won't be disappointed!. END
BEGIN NOW If you have time for a leisurely wait and want your coffee cup "warmed up" as you hang out with the Laurel District gentrifiers, this is your spot. END
BEGIN NOW At prime time there's quite a wait and the parking shituation  is very competitive on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee? So-so. END
BEGIN NOW  Are you hungry? The kitchen isn't as speedy as it should be, but "have some more coffee. END
BEGIN NOW ". END
BEGIN NOW Been here a few times and this premium-priced trendy breakfast spot serves up great food but is a bit over-hyped. END
BEGIN NOW  The original vision is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopefully, they can get more efficient to make the wait and price with the visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Still, it's a four star cafe. END
BEGIN NOW 11/20/15. END
BEGIN NOW  Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW This feels like Valencia Street in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW  A diner serves modern twists of traditional breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  The well-lit space has a dining encounter, booths and tables. END
BEGIN NOW  The tables are also reminiscent of the city--they are packed pretty tight. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW *Golden Waffle ($7. END
BEGIN NOW 50) is thin eggo-like topped with candied apples. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the kind of waffle we prefer, not the thick Belgian kind. END
BEGIN NOW *Spinach and Mushroom Scramble ($12) is the only scramble on the menu so here it is. END
BEGIN NOW  It's perfectly done with runny scrambled egg woven evenly with spinach and fresh mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a cheese person usually but the Swiss is not overpowering and adds flavor to the egg. END
BEGIN NOW  Served with arugula salad, fried potato and a thick buttered toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Hearty and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee is constantly refilled. END
BEGIN NOW  It's from Hot Wire. END
BEGIN NOW  They also gave fresh-squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW  The homemade goods for the day are cranberry scone ($3) and pecan sticky bun ($3. END
BEGIN NOW 50) both of which are tempting. END
BEGIN NOW Berkeley appears to be bleeding into Oakland, as this locally owned and sourced cafe felt like a place you would expect to find about twenty minutes north of this location. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never been to Laurel before, but it's one of those transitional, culturally diverse neighborhoods where you could have a cup of artisan coffee one minute but you feel a need to keep staring at your car while it's parked on the street. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a Temescal-in-waiting, and if it does become the East Bay's next gourmet ghetto, you can thank the husband-and-wife team of Andrew Vennari and Sequoia Broderson who opened this comfy-cozy spot which drew quite a few for breakfast on Saturday morning (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1L2zRnZ). END
BEGIN NOW As usual in Oakland, I was done with my haircut and found myself here in a peckish state. END
BEGIN NOW  Although it was only about a ten-minute wait for me, I was surprised by the constant stream of people looking to dine here since it's fairly nondescript from the outside. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I could tell why the attraction by the eclectic selection of breakfasts on the menu including a $13 Huevos Rancheros and the same-priced Shakshuka, an Israeli-originated melange of squash, peppers, garbanzo beans, lebni (kefir cheese) and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  That all sounded appetizing, but I adhered to the Patriot Act and ordered the all-American-sounding Beef Hash (also $13), certainly not a Hormel Mary Kitchen canned creation by any stretch. END
BEGIN NOW It consisted of shredded slow-braised beef chuck mashed up and fried on the griddle with potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  You could barely see it on the plate because it was covered by big shavings of raw carrots, arugula and a pair of poached eggs with homemade rye toast on the side (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1WEvNpS). END
BEGIN NOW  It looked almost downright healthy but not really, just tasty in a Berkeley commune kind of way with a bit of a kick from a dusting of horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW  As much as I like this dish - and I did - I have to admit it was overshadowed by the sheer flakiness of the freshly baked $3. END
BEGIN NOW 25 Strawberry Scone (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1NieroA). END
BEGIN NOW  Worth every penny and perfectly complemented by the slightly overpriced $2. END
BEGIN NOW 75 cup of Highwire Coffee (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW ly/1Nz1w6h). END
BEGIN NOW  Now where is Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW bold, fresh flavors for such dinerish fare with a standout scone. END
BEGIN NOW AMBIANCE - 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW nice, all-white interior (I mean the walls, not the people. END
BEGIN NOW sort of) in a neighborhood still looking for its identity. END
BEGIN NOW SERVICE - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW very friendly and attentive server. END
BEGIN NOW TOTAL - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW coming back for the Shakshuka. END
BEGIN NOW but seriously, where's Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW Everything we have ordered came out delicious! The sticky buns were made so you can dream about them when you are hungry ! it s packed up weekends but the best time is during the week. END
BEGIN NOW  I am soon happy this dinner is in the Laurel district a few blocks from my house. END
BEGIN NOW Good job!. END
BEGIN NOW When my old roommate from college decided she wanted eggs for breakfast, Montclair Egg Shop seemed like a very logical answer to her hunger. END
BEGIN NOW  There ended up being a 40 minute wait when we showed up at 12 pm on a Saturday, but that led us to exploring the area for the first time (spoiler: there isn't much to do, but there IS a really good bookstore in the area). END
BEGIN NOW THE BASICS. END
BEGIN NOW + It's a very old-fashioned sort of place, like a dusty diner, but in the best possible way. END
BEGIN NOW + At least 50% of the menu (if not more) focuses on eggs (logically so) - meaning you should really order something with eggs. END
BEGIN NOW + Service is pretty fast considering how slammed they get for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW + Their egg creations are quite good (egg shop ham & cheese potato pancakes ftw). END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of amazing that this place has been around and in business for 42 years - definitely a solid place!. END
BEGIN NOW thought my friend meant "eggslut" when he suggested this place, but either way it's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was Antonio and he's just the sweetest thing; genuinely cared about our time there. END
BEGIN NOW It took me a while to order because I couldn't decide between the french toast or the crêpes, but I thoroughly enjoyed my french toast. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is quaint and mellow, much like the rest of the street outside. END
BEGIN NOW All in all: service was great, brunch was lovely, and despite their lack of variety in coffee, I definitely recommend this place. END
BEGIN NOW Ah the egg shop. END
BEGIN NOW  This place seems like an iconic part of Montclair. END
BEGIN NOW The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW  We came here after my best friend had a minor surgery, and were immediately greeted warmly and seated. END
BEGIN NOW  The hostess took our drink orders, and when we hadn't received them by the time our waiter showed up, he immediately ran to do it himself. END
BEGIN NOW  Very cool. END
BEGIN NOW  To the hostesses' credit, it was super busy, and she apologized. END
BEGIN NOW The food is. END
BEGIN NOW okay. END
BEGIN NOW  I opted for chilequiles and was a bit disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  For one, the eggs were over soft- no choice as to how to cook them, and the salsa was bland. END
BEGIN NOW  The quest fresco was rubbery. END
BEGIN NOW  I went from excited to "I can barely eat this" pretty quickly. END
BEGIN NOW My best friend got a large waffle with whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW  She said it was pretty damned good. END
BEGIN NOW  Portion sizes are relatively large. END
BEGIN NOW Basic breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing fancy. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't think I'd spend the money to come back. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice people working here though. END
BEGIN NOW  The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW Ohmygoodness!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is beyond cute. END
BEGIN NOW  It's located in their cute little downtown. END
BEGIN NOW Has a "small-town" vibe to it. END
BEGIN NOW Walking in - the décor reminded me of Leavenworth in WA - Bavarian. END
BEGIN NOW  SUPER CUTE!. END
BEGIN NOW You sign-in at the notepad they have at the podium & have a seat. END
BEGIN NOW There isn't necessarily a hostess - someone behind the counter, cooking was the one that told me to put my name down. END
BEGIN NOW We were seated immediately - there was no one in front of us - so that could be lucky for us. END
BEGIN NOW There is ample seating & the restaurant looks a lot smaller than it really is. END
BEGIN NOW They took our drink orders quickly but took a little longer to take our food orders. END
BEGIN NOW The food did come quickly though - a PLUS in case you're super hungry. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered one of their specials - Garden Omelet which had asparagus, zucchini, spinach, & a bunch of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW I honestly took a couple bites & knew that it wasn't my cup o' tea. END
BEGIN NOW My whole omelet tasted like asparagus. END
BEGIN NOW  Sure, it wouldn't bother me so much but it was just really bland -_-. END
BEGIN NOW No flavor whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! I substituted the potato fries for fruit - as usual it cost extra. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my friend ordered bacon on the side & they charged her 4 dollars. END
BEGIN NOW  Just FYI. END
BEGIN NOW All in all - I wasn't really impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Sad to say, I took the omelet home but pretty much threw it away & made my own omelet. END
BEGIN NOW One of thine partner in crimes and I had a hankering for a tasty brunch experience and a tall glass'a mimosa to start our New Year off right. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not ashamed to admit that I called several other eateries first to see how long the wait time was (and whether they served alcohol) before we ended up here. END
BEGIN NOW  The wait was about 35 minutes, giving us plenty of time to determine what we would be eating before we were seated. END
BEGIN NOW I chose two eggs scrambled with jack cheese, home fries, an english muffin and a side of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  My accomplice dined on the Egg Shop's signature Ham, Cheese & Potato Pancake, which comes with scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  With the exception of my "Home Fried Potatoes", the meal was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes were greasy, undercooked and inedible so I didn't touch them. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend said that her potato pancake was good and didn't suffer from the grease problem that my home freezies did. END
BEGIN NOW  The jealousy was flagrant but I was still happy for her. END
BEGIN NOW  Plus I was too focused on the delicious pomegranate mimosa in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW Our server was Adolfo and he was totally attentive, super sweet and didn't make us feel rushed or act irritated even though by the time we were seated the place was pretty much closed. END
BEGIN NOW  And who wouldn't want to get the hell out of their job on New Year's Day? Thanks again!. END
BEGIN NOW I had the Belgium waffle topped with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream with a side of eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything was delicious, but I had to knock a star off because their coffee was not my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW  It was bitter and just seemed old. END
BEGIN NOW  It didn't taste like a freshly brewed cup of coffee and that dented my eating experience a bit. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd like to bring my own in the future without being judged. END
BEGIN NOW The price was great, the ambiance was really cute. END
BEGIN NOW  There's writing on the ceiling and behind the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW  Really neat place. END
BEGIN NOW Like any good brunch spot, there was a wait and for some reason my cell service was not the best here so talk amongst yourselves. END
BEGIN NOW  hahaha And don't give up on checking in!!. END
BEGIN NOW The service here is always wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW  All the servers and hosts are super friendly with their guests and each other. END
BEGIN NOW I always order something different but I love their "make your own" omelets. END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee is good too. END
BEGIN NOW  I think it'd be super cute if the upstairs were open for eating too because there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW  But whatever, it's never more than a 15 minute wait. END
BEGIN NOW  You know this place must be great if the neighboring restaurants are usually empty while people are waiting to eat here. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely a favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW So I wanted to try a new place and this place had good reviews and the food pics looked great. END
BEGIN NOW  The main thing I wanted to get was the pancakes, but by the time the server came to take our order they "ran out" of pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW  How do you run out of pancakes? Can't you just make more batter?. END
BEGIN NOW Going in it has a very rustic welcoming feel. END
BEGIN NOW  The red brick walls and fireplace makes it more personable. END
BEGIN NOW  Most tables are 2 seaters so because there were 4 of us we were seated in the back. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice and quiet. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the Egg Shop Ham&Cheese Potato Pancake and hubby got the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW  The potato pancake is basically hash browns with ham and cheese which I was looking forward to. END
BEGIN NOW  Unfortunately I was informed it has cilantro which it doesn't state on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  It also didn't state it contains onions and green onions which I discovered after taking my first bite. END
BEGIN NOW  That's about when my gag reflex kicked in. END
BEGIN NOW  Me and onions don't like each other. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd never have ordered it if it said those 2 items were in there. END
BEGIN NOW  Ended up eating my daughter's French toast while she ate the hubby's side order of Belgian waffle. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah they can make waffles but not pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW Hubby was not impressed by the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW  It was ok but was more potatoes and veggies than corned beef. END
BEGIN NOW Their soft drinks were a cup of ice with a soda can so no "refills". END
BEGIN NOW  At $1. END
BEGIN NOW 50-$2. END
BEGIN NOW 50 a can I opted for water. END
BEGIN NOW A little pricey but ok for just me and hubby. END
BEGIN NOW  Not a place we'd bring the kids because our kids eat more than their serving size. END
BEGIN NOW  Lol. END
BEGIN NOW All in all it was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW  I might try it again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it and I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone just yet. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe next time. END
BEGIN NOW maybe. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious french toast and Belgian waffles :). END
BEGIN NOW  With fresh strawberries and whipped cream! Their orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and all of their servers were very nice!! The ambience was chill and kind of eccentric but I liked it! Clowns and trains, and old timey things. END
BEGIN NOW  My only complaint! Was one particularly creepy waiter who worked there and hit on me and my sister and stared every time he walked by. END
BEGIN NOW  Not what I'm looking for with my breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW A little disappointed in this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here on a Sunday at 10:30am. END
BEGIN NOW  Limited street parking because there is a farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW  Also took 30 mins to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW  Guess it's the only joint in town. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered the Benedict with crab cake and also the bloody mary with sake. END
BEGIN NOW  My benedict was very disapponting. END
BEGIN NOW  Eggs were overcooked. END
BEGIN NOW  When I cut into them, the yolk was cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  Also there was avocado skin in my meal that should have been thrown out and random peices of corn?? As for the bloody mary, there was nothing special tasting about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, had high hopes, but the meal was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW Came here on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW   It was packed and there was a long wait. END
BEGIN NOW   Food and service were both good. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Very good!  Nice spot, highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW Omg. END
BEGIN NOW  Their jam though. END
BEGIN NOW  Homemade. END
BEGIN NOW Apricot jam. END
BEGIN NOW  I wanted to steal the whole jar haha! I always get their scramble which is nicely done. END
BEGIN NOW  The eggs are in the runnier side and that's the way I like my eggs! It was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW I feel conflicted about giving this place only 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I have nothing but good memories at this neighborhood place (used to come here in high school). END
BEGIN NOW  The service was wonderful but the food was pretty mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW  My eggs benedict was soggy from the generous amount of hollandaise. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't get me wrong, I love hollandaise with all my heart, but there is such a thing as too much. END
BEGIN NOW  I could also tell that the crab cake had a ton of filler/binder. END
BEGIN NOW  Kind of a nitpicky complaint, but my avocado slices were bruised (at least cut away the bruised parts). END
BEGIN NOW  Bf really liked his potato pancakes though. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfectly crisp and seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW  Food here is like diner food but better, but only a little better. END
BEGIN NOW  The plastic plates and dingy cups don't help. END
BEGIN NOW We typically go here for breakfast meetings and it is never a disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a variety of breakfast items to choose from, whether you have a hankering for a standard 2 eggs and bacon breakfast or maybe a sweeter dish like waffles, or more ethnic dish like breakfast tacos, they have it here!. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday I ordered the breakfast tacos which honestly is the best deal. END
BEGIN NOW   For 8. END
BEGIN NOW 95, you get two tacos with greens, bacon, and eggs how you want it, covered with salsa and a side of half an avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   As you can see from the picture, it's a huge dish!. END
BEGIN NOW Great flavor and fast service. END
BEGIN NOW   On the weekends though, there may be a wait. END
BEGIN NOW  But, totally worth it!. END
BEGIN NOW +/- THE FOOD. END
BEGIN NOW I had really high expectations for this place seeing that it was so packed when I went. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the chicken apple sausage scramble and a pomegranate mimosa and it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW  The scramble was rather bland and didn't have any attributes that stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW  The mimosa was definitely 80% champagne and 20% juice. END
BEGIN NOW  I tasted no pomegranate whatosever. END
BEGIN NOW  I also tried my friend's regular orange mimosa and same thing- too much champagne. END
BEGIN NOW + THE ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW The place is absolutely adorable. END
BEGIN NOW  It's like you stepped into a little cottage from a storybook. END
BEGIN NOW  The restaurant is neatly decorated with a bunch of gadgets and gizmos like toy trains and inspirational quotes on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is pretty small but very clean. END
BEGIN NOW We went to the Montclair Egg Shop this week for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW  I was hungry so I ordered the challah bread French toast and an omelette with bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, and jack cheese. END
BEGIN NOW The omelette was your standard size and was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  The French toast was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread was too flat/thin and it tasted just okay. END
BEGIN NOW The prices were good and the service was good as well. END
BEGIN NOW  We will return!. END
BEGIN NOW Breakfast of Champions! You know it's that good if you saw Andre Iguodala enjoying his breakfast while you were here. END
BEGIN NOW  Shared the potato pancake and salmon scramble, both were delicious and hearty. END
BEGIN NOW NBA Finals MVP approved! #StrengthInNumbers #NBAChamps #Warriors. END
BEGIN NOW Service is good. END
BEGIN NOW Nice atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW Attractive interior. END
BEGIN NOW If you are into America style breakfast no doubt it suits to your pallet. END
BEGIN NOW Vs decent European breakfast places eg in the nicer parts of London, there is way more sugar and other high glycogen index ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW  such ingredients are not too my taste, leave me feeling bloated and of course contributes to putting on weight. END
BEGIN NOW scrambled eggs with salmon:-- like most America breakfast the egg was more like an omelet chopped up. END
BEGIN NOW  The salmon is mixed in to the egg, which also makes it more difficult to cook to the best consistency. END
BEGIN NOW old fashioned oaks:-- expecting big fat Scottish rolled oats which typically have lots of flavour, but found them to be more like typical modern rolled oats. END
BEGIN NOW  I asked for no sugar but there was shed loads of both brown sugar and honey. END
BEGIN NOW  It was sweeter than a pudding. END
BEGIN NOW  The oats were also overlooked and had lost all there lost form. END
BEGIN NOW they kindly took it back and brought me a version with no sugar or honey and the oats were less cooked. END
BEGIN NOW Mocha:- pleasant but massive(full size tall  glass) too sweet, suspect they use the chocolate syrup as couldn't taste much cocoa. END
BEGIN NOW All in all pretty consistent with other American breakfast places I've been to above average atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be making my own breakfast until I discover a decent place. END
BEGIN NOW Came here a second time for dinner instead of brunch this time. END
BEGIN NOW DRINKS- Plaid on plaid drink was so good! Love those egg white drinks, and they do it well here. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD- Tried their famous fried chicken, and it was soooo juicy!! I was surprised. END
BEGIN NOW  Just wish there were more vegetables since they only gave 2 pieces of asparagus with 2 giant fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW ATMOSPHERE- modern, restaurant is small inside, so we sat outside which was quite nice. END
BEGIN NOW  Lively neighborhood to grab dinner at. END
BEGIN NOW OVERALL- Awesome restaurant!. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry to be late in posting this. END
BEGIN NOW life gets in the way, especially when one is remodeling [smile]. END
BEGIN NOW After a lovely 2014 Holiday Series dinner, the 2015 Holiday Series dinner, which essentially promised the same menu of various goose dishes, was a real letdown. END
BEGIN NOW  Cost-cutting undermined  the once-lovely appetizer plate, which had a similar trio of dishes but was less generous,less interesting, and more green salad than anything else. END
BEGIN NOW Entree dish was salty (confit; insufficiently rinsed) and greasy (potatoes). END
BEGIN NOW  The breast meat was chewy even tho sliced thin, and a touch overseasoned with thyme. END
BEGIN NOW  Grilled escarole was a nice bitter element but the plate was surprisingly dull-looking, especially compared to prior year's plate where bright Fuyu persimmons provided a lovely accent in both color and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Hopscotch's dessert menu is annoyingly banal. END
BEGIN NOW  In an area filled with great pastry chefs, offering mud pie or donuts is disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  We tried the latter, which were dull and served with a too-sweet butterscotch cream. END
BEGIN NOW  It has no depth, and since the donuts are just fried dough, a little something more interesting is needed than just additional sugar on top of grease and flour. END
BEGIN NOW Overall: a big miss which left us sad. END
BEGIN NOW  Itani's one of Oakland's premier groundbreaking chefs, but we're finding better food elsewhere these days. END
BEGIN NOW Meat-heavy, drink-heavy. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite diner decor, this is for people who know little about food. END
BEGIN NOW  Mel's in SF makes this place look sick. END
BEGIN NOW  Thunderously noisy, even though there's not many tables. END
BEGIN NOW  Travesty. END
BEGIN NOW  Little pieces of heavily battered fish. END
BEGIN NOW  Much vaunted duck fat chips are a waste of $2. END
BEGIN NOW  There are many places where duck fat fries are worth the upcharge. END
BEGIN NOW Hopscotch is not one of them. END
BEGIN NOW  The three of us compared them head-to-head with the regular fries, and found very, very, very scant difference. END
BEGIN NOW  Both regular and duck fat were slightly too greasy; we like our chips a bit crisper. END
BEGIN NOW  The batter was the extra-crispy style, which Spouse dislikes, and was fried so hard and so long that even the dark meat was dried out. END
BEGIN NOW  It also had the dessicated look of fried food that had been sitting around, although he said it was very hot all the way through. END
BEGIN NOW  He did like the raw pickled cauliflower florets with it, however. END
BEGIN NOW  Burger unsalted (big NO-NO) and didn't cover the bun. END
BEGIN NOW  Slice of tongue was super-tiny and dried out. END
BEGIN NOW  Pork belly griddled so it was just chewy thick bacon, much ado about nothing. END
BEGIN NOW  The bun was good, but buttered before grilling, making it greasy. END
BEGIN NOW  Adding mayo and aioli just made it even greasier. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered medium-rare, but came medium. END
BEGIN NOW  No option for cheese, highly irritating because this puppy needed some salt (and I don't often say that, being on 20 yrs of low-salt diet!). END
BEGIN NOW  Needed a whole lot more of those pickled onions to get any flavor through all the oil slick. END
BEGIN NOW Iced tea was a very strange black tea/sassafras blend. END
BEGIN NOW  Does anybody seriously think weak flat root beer flavoring makes good iced tea???  But the ginger limeade was superb. END
BEGIN NOW  By itself, however, one good juice drink isn't enough to be worth the schlep out here. END
BEGIN NOW Try Spice Monkey for fish'n'chips, Pican or Bistro 1491 for fried chicken, and anywhere else for a burger. END
BEGIN NOW If only yelp allowed half stars, 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5 would be my true rating. END
BEGIN NOW Service. END
BEGIN NOW Came here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW  Love the ambience. END
BEGIN NOW  Small, cozy space. END
BEGIN NOW  Restaurant was slow. END
BEGIN NOW  Walked in. END
BEGIN NOW  No hostess. END
BEGIN NOW  Then she appeared behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Attended to a customer who had a takeout order, but neglected to greet us afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW  Had to approach her to ask, "Do we seat ourselves?". END
BEGIN NOW  Unenthusiastically, she responded, "No, I will. END
BEGIN NOW " Half star ticked right off for that!. END
BEGIN NOW The server was friendly, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't stand when a waiter asks you five times in 10 min intervals, "How is everything?". END
BEGIN NOW There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant and they are dog friendly, yay!! My friend asked the server for some chicken for the dog and (although it took a while. END
BEGIN NOW ) he came back with perfectly grilled slices of chicken (4 bucks a breast). END
BEGIN NOW  The food came out in a timely manner, but our additional order of the two Yonsei Oysters were lagging and we even thought that that it might have been forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW  There were only three other tables at this time. END
BEGIN NOW  Another half star ticked off!. END
BEGIN NOW Food. END
BEGIN NOW Start-Little Green Salad with butter lettuce, baby kale, (shaved) celery, hazelnuts, soft sheeps cheese, Sherry vinaigrette: (warning: it's truly starter size and takes four full bites to eat. END
BEGIN NOW ) Some bites were overly salted and others under. END
BEGIN NOW  The sheeps cheese was the star. END
BEGIN NOW  Greens were crisp and can't hate on those toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW  Last half star ticked off for this one!. END
BEGIN NOW Main-Buttermilk Fried Chicken with black sesame asparagus: DAMN, that crusty, crunchy, flakey, party in yo mouth chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW  Tell me your secrets! It's a GIANT chicken drumstick+thigh. END
BEGIN NOW  The meat itself was well cooked over a bed of cabbage slaw. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally, topped with two grilled asparagus (keepin those expectations realistic!). END
BEGIN NOW  Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but pretty darn good. END
BEGIN NOW Side-Yonsei Oysters with sea urchin, salmon roe and citrus: Real fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW  These were the good ones. END
BEGIN NOW  Little sweet oysters. END
BEGIN NOW  Gotta love that sea brine. END
BEGIN NOW  More citrus than soy, but how can you go wrong that roe and sea urchin??! A dozen more please!. END
BEGIN NOW I really wanted to like this place for brunch but only had an ok experience. END
BEGIN NOW Warning:. END
BEGIN NOW We asked for another cup with a new pot and tasted just as bad. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems like no AC so expect to sweat on a warm day. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't imagine in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW Now to food. END
BEGIN NOW 1. END
BEGIN NOW  Buttermilk fried chicken - crispy, juicy, fresh and hot. END
BEGIN NOW  Chicken and gravy were the best part of my brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  However, biscuit was hard and chewy. END
BEGIN NOW  Side of fruits tasted sour and old :( Also no choice on how you want your eggs when you order this dish. END
BEGIN NOW  Only scrambled. END
BEGIN NOW 2. END
BEGIN NOW  Mushroom Benedict - lacks flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Need a lil truffle oil or something to enhance the shiitake mushrooms and need to reduce the cream on the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW 3. END
BEGIN NOW  Donuts - good but really small for the portion. END
BEGIN NOW only 3 mini round donuts. END
BEGIN NOW  Gotta split the 3rd :/. END
BEGIN NOW Honestly don't know if I'll try this place again. END
BEGIN NOW  Tempted to go back and order the Benedict with pork belly but not sure I can convince the BF to give it another shot. END
BEGIN NOW This is a cute, trendy spot in Uptown Oakland where customers ranging from college students to older, more mature patrons come to dine. END
BEGIN NOW  It is a tiny restaurant, but there is seating both inside and outside, and the decorations are spot-on. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu changes for lunch and dinner, and are limited to about 5-7 offerings, and is on the pricey side. END
BEGIN NOW I came here once for brunch and another time for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW My favorite is the yonsei oysters, which includes salmon roe and uni on the half shell, a perfect Asian fusion dish. END
BEGIN NOW  They taste fresh and complex. END
BEGIN NOW  One second you taste the salty juices of the roe, then you taste the sweet briny freshness of the uni, followed by the cool ocean flavor of the oysters. END
BEGIN NOW  The portions are a bit small but they are definitely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW For brunch, I had the braised pork belly benedict. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork belly was cooked perfectly, crunchy and tender at the right places. END
BEGIN NOW  The hollandaise sauce was the right amount of creamy and citrusy. END
BEGIN NOW  I liked that it was a well-executed twist on a classic brunch platter. END
BEGIN NOW However, I did not like the dinner dishes as much. END
BEGIN NOW  They seemed a bit too average for the price you pay. END
BEGIN NOW  Granted, I'm sure they use the most high quality and the freshest ingredients, but at $19 for a plate of pasta and $22 for clams, I sort of expect something out of this world. END
BEGIN NOW The soba bucatini is very tomatoey but tastes just a bit better than the average pasta, though the green beans do add a nice crunch. END
BEGIN NOW  The manila clams were yummy and it came with a deep-fried vegetable that paired well with the seafood tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I felt the prices were too high for what my bf and I got. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, this is a nice little date spot, but much more so for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a bar and serve all types of alcohol, so it's great for boozey brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Any chance to try a new brunch place is gladly taken - #brunchsohard! We heard this place has a better brunch menu than dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a very small location but there's apparently more seating next door! You can make reservations too, so definitely plan ahead. END
BEGIN NOW Everything on their menu was tempting - American brunch fare with a Korean twist, what better combination could there be!? I just had to go for the kimchee fried rice with shoyu eggs and pork belly. END
BEGIN NOW  Tender, flavorful, spicy and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW every bite was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  We also got to try the donuts with butterscotch cream (it should be a sin to have this for breakfast) and the cinnamon challah toast with jam (how is this so soft?!). END
BEGIN NOW  I had a bite of their famous fried chicken and biscuits for whatever room was left in my stomach and wow it was not your typical chicken and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW Based on my experience today, you will not be disappointed no matter what you order. END
BEGIN NOW  Wish we had this place closer to home. END
BEGIN NOW I'd be ordering that kimchee fried rice on a weekly basis. END
BEGIN NOW I went with a Yonsei Oyster and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken--both were good, but both items are way overpriced which disallows me from giving this place anymore than 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything else about the experience here was outstanding except the $23 chicken that didn't even come with a carb on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  That dish is worth $13-$15 at most. END
BEGIN NOW  It was literally just some fried chicken (sure, dredged in their signature marinade of buttermilk, soy sauce, and potato starch), some asparagus, and chrysanthemum salad with vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW  The chicken was juicy and tasty but it wasn't even a decent size--was still hungry after. END
BEGIN NOW  You can argue that this one dish alone isn't supposed to fill you up however I think that the very essence of fried chicken is a comfort food that serves the purpose of filling you up and if someone wants to make it extra special, he/she can do that, but he/she doesn't need to make it so fancy it becomes small and too expensive. END
BEGIN NOW  It's fried chicken, how much extra does your buttermilk and soy sauce cost? This isn't Napa where you're surrounded by million dollar wineries. END
BEGIN NOW  I can understand overpriced oysters, but $23 fried chicken in Oakland? You've got to be kidding me. END
BEGIN NOW Since I wasn't fully satisfied, I had to go to Belly down the street which is where I should've went to in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW  Literally, if they just added something like mashed or scalloped potatoes, this dish would be on point. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not sure why everyone raves about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Furthermore, I've never complained about negative space on a dish but even from the consumer point of view, the dish didn't come together well looks-wise. END
BEGIN NOW  It'll leave you hanging like, "where's the rest of my food?" The oyster was pretty delicious, but not worth $5. END
BEGIN NOW So, I honestly would recommend checking out Hopscotch and I want to come back someday to give it another try, but please do yourself a favor and refrain from ordering that fried chicken--you're better off going to 'insert-your-favorite-fast-food-fried-chicken-joint here'. END
BEGIN NOW On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and it's a cozy unique atmosphere that defines the rising Oakland food scene. END
BEGIN NOW  I believe it might be best to make reservations if you're anticipating to come with friends during peak eating times. END
BEGIN NOW I have to say Hopscotch has a pretty delicious brunch! This was my first time brunching in Oakland as opposed to SF, and it was pretty positive overall. END
BEGIN NOW  The setup of the restaurant is a little confusing, as there are two separate rooms separated by a convenience store in the middle. END
BEGIN NOW  We dined in the second room, which I actually thought had a nicer and more spacious layout. END
BEGIN NOW We started off the meal with some mimosas and the Donuts and Butterscotch Cream. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely try these because they're super warm and fluffy, and the butterscotch is so good you'll literally want to bottle it and take it home! We decided to split a couple of the entrees, so we ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Biscuits, which had a really tasty gravy drizzled on top. END
BEGIN NOW  The biscuit was nice and flaky and you can tell it's homemade. END
BEGIN NOW  We also got the Kimchee Fried Rice with pork belly, which was the standout of the meal for me. END
BEGIN NOW  The rice was really authentic, and I loved the addition of the jidori eggs!. END
BEGIN NOW I've heard Hopscotch also has a delicious dinner menu, so I'd definitely come back to check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW The combination of Beer (hops) and Scotch is already awesome but add gastro pub grub and you have the makings of a winner! The place is split into two separate rooms that are surrounding some other business so that's a bit strange at first. END
BEGIN NOW  The main room where the hostess is located is quite small and I was wondering if we were going to fit. END
BEGIN NOW  After a very short walk to their "annex" as they called it, we were pleased to find more larger tables and room for our party of four. END
BEGIN NOW  Both rooms were sparsely decorated and appeared that the building was from the early 1900s, it had a cozy feel. END
BEGIN NOW I had to start with a Hop / Scotch Pairing. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the Nikka Coffee Whiskey paired with Fort Point Charred Manzanita Red Ale ($14). END
BEGIN NOW  The Scotch was served neat with both water and ice on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  I popped a single rock into the scotch to open it up a bit and proceeded to sip back and forth off the two enjoying how the flavors played off each other in harmony. END
BEGIN NOW The menu is spartan with only 5 entree offerings and 6 starter options. END
BEGIN NOW  My wife had the ribs and I got to try one, they were quite good. END
BEGIN NOW  They were tender but not too tender, seasoned well and served with Japanese Sweet Potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the "First Base" Burger. END
BEGIN NOW  It was a blend of house ground chuck and beef tongue. END
BEGIN NOW  Now beef tongue is not usually something I seek out but I was feeling adventurous. END
BEGIN NOW  I took a chance and ordered it medium rare on the waitresses suggestion and unfortunately is came out about as rare as I've ever seen a burger. END
BEGIN NOW  I still ate it and it was tasty but I learned my lesson, medium for burgers, medium rare for steaks. END
BEGIN NOW  I added the house cured bacon and some cheddar cheese to my burger and that put it @ $20. END
BEGIN NOW  The $20 burger was served with some house made kennebec potato chips, it would have cost $4 more to substitute fries. END
BEGIN NOW Price was my major gripe at this place (besides the uber rare meat), our bill was over $60 for the 2 of us and I had a burger! I'm not from the area so when I come back to town I will likely not return but it's worth trying at least once. END
BEGIN NOW First time here for brunch, heard it was good but no expectations. END
BEGIN NOW  We started with the Wasabi Bloody Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a big Bloody Mary person but these totally hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Just the right level of heat and spice. END
BEGIN NOW Then the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW  You know when you have a bite of food and everyone goes quiet and looks at each other? Especially with a group that is usually not quiet? And then the conversation shifts to "What would be your last meal?" because the plate in front of you is now in the running? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  Get the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW Oh God and then the main course. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the fried chicken with the sausage gravy on the side, poached eggs, biscuit and (mostly decorative) fruit and salad. END
BEGIN NOW  This is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  And the gravy with the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW  Ugh. END
BEGIN NOW  I am still thinking about it 3 days later. END
BEGIN NOW The service was friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  Took a while to get our food, especially considering the place was mostly empty on a late Saturday afternoon, but I guess you can't rush perfection. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW Any bar/restaurant that offers happy hour on a Saturday has a very, very special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW  Especially when their happy hour menu includes $7 cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  Our bartender made the most amazing whiskey sours - he put egg white in them, so they were frothy and almost creamy. END
BEGIN NOW The food is ah-mazing too. END
BEGIN NOW  Holy crap, this is a f*cking good hamburger. END
BEGIN NOW  The patty is so, so juicy and you can really taste that it's freshly made because the meat just crumbles in juicy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW  Fries are thick and soft and they give you this tangy orange aioli to dip them in. END
BEGIN NOW  It paired reallllly well with our whiskey sours. END
BEGIN NOW The ambiance is old-timey and incredibly charming. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopscotch has a second, disconnected room over from Subway (can we just get rid of the Subway?!) that we were seated in. END
BEGIN NOW  One entire wall is a cream-colored tufted leather booth. END
BEGIN NOW  It feels like something out of the golden age of jazz. END
BEGIN NOW Service is remarkably friendly and made for a very comfortable experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Love love love Hopscotch. END
BEGIN NOW Oh hey, you can get a bucket of fried chicken to-go too :). END
BEGIN NOW A friend who knows I like fried chicken said I had to come here and try their buttermilk fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   $18 for half a chicken, she said. END
BEGIN NOW   At those prices, it'd better be some chicken, I said. END
BEGIN NOW In the first place, it isn't half a chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   (To be fair to the restaurant, they don't say it is. END
BEGIN NOW )  It's two pieces, a boneless breast and a drumstick (not boneless), sort of melded together with a bridge of excess breading. END
BEGIN NOW   When it was served, I was told "the only bone is in the drumstick", which suggested that there might be at least a boneless thigh or a boneless wing in there somewhere, but there wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW The breading was very crunchy and very thick. END
BEGIN NOW   It had an interesting seasoning, that was its best point. END
BEGIN NOW   It was quite tolerable with the thick, not particularly moist breast meat. END
BEGIN NOW   Once I'd eaten that, though, the breading became overwhelming, and I was glad there wasn't any more. END
BEGIN NOW After leaving here, I drove up Telegraph and went past a Church's, and I thought: I could have gotten twice as much fried chicken, just as good and with less heavy breading, for half as much money, if I'd gone here instead. END
BEGIN NOW One of the rare times my wife and I agreed that a restaurant was 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW I had the burger. END
BEGIN NOW  It was perfectly done, juicy, and tasted amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  One of the best burgers I've had. END
BEGIN NOW  It was worth the $14. END
BEGIN NOW My wife had the ribs, which she loved. END
BEGIN NOW  The meat came off the bone very easily, and the sauce was quite flavorful (and a bit smokey, which she liked). END
BEGIN NOW  She was also very happy with the cocktail she had (an interesting tropical and smokey flavor combo). END
BEGIN NOW We also really enjoyed the mud pie. END
BEGIN NOW No complaints!. END
BEGIN NOW Food to die for and a counter to die at. END
BEGIN NOW Brunch could be wonderful, but you can't eat comfortably at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW  The stools have no foot rest and you get a climbing Halfdome experience clinging to the 2 inch rail the provide. END
BEGIN NOW NOTE TO READER: Before I get my head chopped off by other yelpers. END
BEGIN NOW  (This has happened before) I am about to go on a 14 hour flight, out of the country. END
BEGIN NOW  During this flight I have nothing to do and I know I have slacked on my reviewing because I have been crazy busy! Although every time I have gone somewhere new I made it a point to check-in so I may go back and review later. END
BEGIN NOW  It has taken me a while to review these restaurants but I am finally doing so. END
BEGIN NOW  Before somebody says "you posted x9843058048 reviews in one day", please know that I am reviewing as my flight is in the air and will be posting once landed at my destination. END
BEGIN NOW  Thank you! Also, I review on trip advisor before anybody goes psycho crazy on me saying they seen this review elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW  I post on both yelp and trip advisor of my reviews! Thank you (:. END
BEGIN NOW Location: Downtown Oakland, street parking!. END
BEGIN NOW Customer Service: Fast and welcoming!. END
BEGIN NOW Decor: Small restaurant but cutesy atmosphere, we sat at the table top seating where the small bar is at. END
BEGIN NOW Presentation of Food: ---. END
BEGIN NOW How did the food taste?: FIRST BASE BURGER WITH GRIDDLED BEEF TONGUE. END
BEGIN NOW  That's all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW  AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW Overall Experience: Good!. END
BEGIN NOW Would I Come Back?: Yes!! Hell Yes!. END
BEGIN NOW When my daughter flew in from Orlando, she was hungry. END
BEGIN NOW   So, we decided to eat something small. END
BEGIN NOW   Hence, we came to Oakland Grill. END
BEGIN NOW   We were here a few times, but I never got a chance to write a review until now. END
BEGIN NOW We ordered the waffle with 2 eggs, and 2 bacons. END
BEGIN NOW   When they brought the plate, it was a large portion. END
BEGIN NOW   Good side for 2 people. END
BEGIN NOW   My daughter and I shared a plate. END
BEGIN NOW The food wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW   Can't really go wrong with breakfast, unless it's Dennys. END
BEGIN NOW   For the most part, it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I like their service. END
BEGIN NOW   Very friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW   The ambience wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW   It can get very busy during the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW   Be prepare for it. END
BEGIN NOW Rating:. END
BEGIN NOW Food:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Service:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Price:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Ambience:  4. END
BEGIN NOW Overall:  4. END
BEGIN NOW I would come back over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW We got lucky with parking for a Sunday but we did look for around 10 mins. END
BEGIN NOW Wait was super quick for a Sunday at 11:30, the guy who seated us was awesome!. END
BEGIN NOW Get to a cute table, given menus. END
BEGIN NOW Waitress comes and is stank in the face, I can tell this will be fun, no hello, no nothing, just :. END
BEGIN NOW "What would you like? ". END
BEGIN NOW The food was expensive for what it is but hey that's trendy Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW I would have at least had an egg that was cooked to order. END
BEGIN NOW  ( picture added ). END
BEGIN NOW I got attitude for being allergic to pineapple, had no idea pancakes come with a side of fruit as it's not mentioned on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sad! My boyfriend loves Eggs Benny and his would have been really easy place to help him get his fix. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! Family could not stop telling me about the crab cakes, and they were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Serving size here is stupendous. END
BEGIN NOW   Staff here is really nice, and our waitress was so attentive. END
BEGIN NOW We split the crab cake benedict and pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW   The apple sausage is worth trying. END
BEGIN NOW I love a breakfast place like this. END
BEGIN NOW   The atmosphere is just relaxed and warm. END
BEGIN NOW I came with a bigger group of 6 and had about a 25 minute wait which is a lot faster than I thought it would be considering the large crowd of people standing outside of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the chef's eggs Benedict which I was really excited about from the reviews, but sadly it just fell short. END
BEGIN NOW  The eggs itself were cooked perfectly and the side potatoes were well seasoned and quite tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Aside from that everything else was quite disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  The sausage wasn't very tasty and the sauce was too overpowering and made the toasted English muffin soggy and hard to cut through. END
BEGIN NOW  Though I was starving coming in I barely could finish half the meal. END
BEGIN NOW Taking a bite of the cob salad, I wish I would have gotten that because the crispy bacon and the fresh lettuce mixed with the well seasoned chicken (which was a hair dry) was worlds better than what I had. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, aside from the great customer service this place was just meh and I probably would check out another breakfast place next time. END
BEGIN NOW GREAT BRUNCH SPOT! Generous portions, and their potato hash is bomb! It has a subtle spiciness to it. END
BEGIN NOW  The side of potatoes comes with your entree, or it's 3. END
BEGIN NOW 99$ as a side. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict, which was on their special. END
BEGIN NOW  It had heaping servings of crab, a great creamy hollandaise sauce on top and a great portion of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  For 1. END
BEGIN NOW 99$, you can substitute your toast with a pancake. END
BEGIN NOW We also ordered the turkey/avocado/bacon Benedict, also on their special. END
BEGIN NOW  The combo was amazing and the poached egg was nice & drippy when I poked into it. END
BEGIN NOW Great spot, service was friendly & atmosphere was inviting. END
BEGIN NOW  Will definitely come back !. END
BEGIN NOW Jack London Square was fairly empty on Monday around 11:30 am. END
BEGIN NOW  Assuming that it was a weekday and no one around, we thought the Oakland Grill wouldn't have much people. END
BEGIN NOW  But I guess everyone that didn't have work also decided to go to Oakland grill. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty packed, we came in and snagged the last table. END
BEGIN NOW CRAB CAKE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW 99. END
BEGIN NOW SUPER FRIED. END
BEGIN NOW  but it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW  [Crab cake+Poached egg + hollandaise sauce+English muffin]. END
BEGIN NOW My friend preferred the blackstone Benedict, he said the crab and was too heavy and too fried for him. END
BEGIN NOW  All of the benedicts come with seasoned potatoes with a dollop of sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW  I Put the sour cream on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  Also comes with two small slices of fruit. END
BEGIN NOW BLACKSTONE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW 99. END
BEGIN NOW [bacon+tomato+hollandaise sauce+English muffin] totally preferred the crab cake. END
BEGIN NOW  The way they made the eggs though wasn't as runny as we all thought it would be. END
BEGIN NOW  This one was okay to me, but my friends loved this one way more. END
BEGIN NOW STRAWBERRY MIMOSA: $3. END
BEGIN NOW 99. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty small glass. END
BEGIN NOW  I totally thought it was strawberry + mimosa (OJ + Champagne) but it was actually strawberry + champagne. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Wish the flavor was more crispy C like a chilled glass or something. END
BEGIN NOW ORANGE JUICE: $4. END
BEGIN NOW 50. END
BEGIN NOW Freshly squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW  No pulp. END
BEGIN NOW  A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW  Small glass. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely a good find. END
BEGIN NOW  Would come again. END
BEGIN NOW  Has the ambience of a Denny's diner. END
BEGIN NOW  Also has an upstairs for dining. END
BEGIN NOW This was a cool little place my work group visited while out on a team building trip. END
BEGIN NOW  The location is in an area where there's a lot of wholesale produce traffic, so be forewarned that not only is parking bad, but be mindful of fast moving forklifts hauling produce. END
BEGIN NOW The restaurant has a lot of charm. END
BEGIN NOW  The kind of charm that says "established" and unpretentious. END
BEGIN NOW   My coworker set up the whole affair and had their staff arrange a large table for us. END
BEGIN NOW  While a few of my coworkers were late, they cheerfully filled our water glasses and coffee mugs without rushing us or giving us the impatient looks. END
BEGIN NOW  Granted it wasn't busy, but you all have been there. END
BEGIN NOW After having four cups of coffee, I had the applewood smoked sausage with eggs and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW  It was quite filling and I only finished about more than half. END
BEGIN NOW  In my opinion the apple sausage was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but was still pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a heaping portion of hash browns which was done right and not swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW Service was really good, they really took good care of us. END
BEGIN NOW I seriously doubt I'll venture here again as it's pretty far from where I live and parking is typical Oakland, but if someone invited me, I'd cheerfully meet them there. END
BEGIN NOW Lipstick stains on my coffee cup, potatoes didn't have the sour cream I asked for, an item that was not mine was added to my bill, and the poached egg on my benedict was fully cooked and didn't run at all! That's the whole point of the benedict! All of this and I couldn't even find my server to ask for these things to be fixed until my date was finished with their food. END
BEGIN NOW  Super bummer. END
BEGIN NOW  The only reason I gave a second star was that I've been here before and had a better experience. END
BEGIN NOW  This was pretty disappointing though. END
BEGIN NOW Oakland Grill will definitely satisfy your breakfast needs for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Located in downtown Oakland, it serves breakfast all day for those late risers. END
BEGIN NOW I went with the Lox Benedict (smoked salmon) with a side of potatoes and a few strawberry mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW   It was tasty, hearty, and the portion was huge. END
BEGIN NOW  The mimosas was mostly champagne, so don't worry about being skimped. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The only downside is my smoked salmon was topped with warm hollandaise sauce that lightly cooked the salmon (I like mine raw). END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe I should've ordered it on the side next time. END
BEGIN NOW Go with the Benedict, they're most popular dish. END
BEGIN NOW Oakland Grill is my solution to my Jersey diner. END
BEGIN NOW * They serve their menu all day (yes, breakfast anytime), they're pretty much always busy on the weekends, the food is hearty and reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW I've been both for weekday lunch and a Sunday brunch and both did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW  Lunch was much calmer; we walked right in like we owned the place. END
BEGIN NOW  My chicken and black beans was so large, I failed to clean my plate. END
BEGIN NOW  It was also healthy (yay!), filled with grilled chicken, black beans, fresh salsa, corn tortillas, a side salad and what seemed to be a half avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  It's so nice to be able to order fresh food at a casual eatery like this. END
BEGIN NOW This past weekend's meal wasn't quite so healthy. END
BEGIN NOW  I indulged in the veggie benedict with hollandaise on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  Not the most adventurous order, but definitely a solid one! The perfectly poached eggs topped on an english muffin with grilled tomatoes and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  My one complaint? I think they could step it up on their english muffin game. END
BEGIN NOW  Change it up maybe? Higher quality muffins? Still wonderful, but it could have used a lil' something. END
BEGIN NOW Most breakfasts come with what seems to be a pound of breakfast potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  Although the b'fast potatoes are solid, I prefer mine extra crispy (which I'll request for next time), as these were a bit more mushy. END
BEGIN NOW  The fresh fruit slices are such a great touch and this fruit was perfectly ripe!. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee is dece, nothing gourmet and I spied a strawberry mimosa that was going like hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is on point with water glasses always filled and quick service. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, a solid neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure if I'd wait an hour to grub, but definitely worth a 20 minute wait as the direct 'hood can be a bit sparse for brunching options, especially on a Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW * There are more diners per capita in Jersey than anywhere else in the world! Boo ya! #Themoreyouknow. END
BEGIN NOW Decent neighborhood establishment with all the usual items you'd expect for brunch, whether omelets, scrambles, benedicts, and other egg-heavy dishes; or lunch, such as salads, sandwiches, and burgers. END
BEGIN NOW  Anything you can get here is going to be pretty dependable and well-portioned for the price. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is reasonably friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, a perfectly decent experience that might not pack a lot of "wow" punches but is nevertheless dependable. END
BEGIN NOW Stopped in here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and it was pretty packed but they seated us within 5 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the eggs vocal stone which was like an eggs Benedict but with bacon and tomatoes instead of Canadian bacon. END
BEGIN NOW  The hollandaise sauce was amazing and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  My fiancé also had a pancake which was super fluffy and the portions were great. END
BEGIN NOW  Would definitely eat here again. END
BEGIN NOW One of my favorite brunch spots! Especially since they serve breakfast ALL DAY!. END
BEGIN NOW Its usually busy but you get seat right away almost all the time! Once you walk in, always get greeted by someone who's working. END
BEGIN NOW I usually order the Eggs Benedict and you always get a choice to have fruits or potatoes on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  They always have the freshest fruits available and if you have a specific fruit you only want, they will be happy to accommodate you. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried the potatoes too and they were equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW The server always comes  by to fill your water cup without you having to ask. END
BEGIN NOW  They constantly come by to check up on your table. END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone is always extremely friendly. END
BEGIN NOW My favourite brunch spot in Oakland hands down. END
BEGIN NOW  Recommended by my grandma who would frequently come here during her conferences back in the day and whose advice I take to heart. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a creature of habit so I always order the crab cake Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW loved it the first time and every time since. END
BEGIN NOW  Their food is Always bomb and just made with lots love. END
BEGIN NOW The spot is hidden, near a produce area, lots of parking outside. END
BEGIN NOW  It has 2 levels, downstairs with booths or upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW  Excellent cooks behind those grills, and friendly servers. END
BEGIN NOW  A must whilst in Oakland!!. END
BEGIN NOW This place is in such a hidden area (near all the meat packaging/wholesale warehouses). END
BEGIN NOW  I love it regardless though!. END
BEGIN NOW FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW I got one of the Benedict and can't remember which one but I've never been a fan of crab cake or ham so I asked if I could replace it with a sausage patty and they were able to accommodate me! The one thing I look forward to in eating eggs benedict is the yolk that comes out of it, and for both my visits the yolk came gushing out, YES!. END
BEGIN NOW SERVICE:. END
BEGIN NOW The servers have always been super nice. END
BEGIN NOW  I've never had a bad encounter with any of them. END
BEGIN NOW  Super friendly, and I'm glad they're able to substitute. END
BEGIN NOW PARKING:. END
BEGIN NOW Parking is on the street, & it is meter parking, unless you park like 2 blocks away for 2 hour free parking. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious eggs benedict and $3 mimosas? Yes please!. END
BEGIN NOW Arrived here for the usual Sunday brunch ritual after getting frustrated and not finding any bottomless mimosa spots that served past 2 pm. END
BEGIN NOW  We settled for this spot when we noticed how nicely priced their mimosas were. END
BEGIN NOW  It was of course incredibly busy since it was Sunday brunch hours and but we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was incredibly kind and it being our first time was very information and willingly gave us her recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW My friend went with the burger and I opted for the eggs benedict after eyeing it up at our neighbor's table. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sure the crab benedict is the more popular option, but oddly enough I'm not the biggest fan of crab. END
BEGIN NOW  Two rounds of mimosas in and our food arrived. END
BEGIN NOW  It looked AMAZING first off, and the taste matched its appearances. END
BEGIN NOW  The eggs were basically orgasmic. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfectly cooked and explosive with all that delicious yolk. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes that came on the side were freaking delicious as well! So packed full of different type of herbs, flavors, and you can tell that the cooks had scraped all of the good stuff off of the pan (hey, that's where all the flavor is, right?) to garnish the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  I was in heaven, and so incredibly happy by the time the meal was done. END
BEGIN NOW I do wish they had bottomless mimosas and chicken and waffles, but those are just my own selfish desires. END
BEGIN NOW  Other than that, I will certainly return!. END
BEGIN NOW Great everything!  Seriously. END
BEGIN NOW   I had never tried Red Bay Coffee before this- two thumbs up!  Plus it's roasted in Oakland- I love that!. END
BEGIN NOW I first tried the oatmeal and went for sweet- adding bananas, brown sugar and yogurt. END
BEGIN NOW   Delicious!  However, the polenta- oh the polenta!  I get it with caramelized red onions, fresh green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and sea salt. END
BEGIN NOW   Filling, nutritious and absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW It was all so good that I had to go back and try their donut happy hour- HOLY COW!!. END
BEGIN NOW Top that all off with a fantastic mission- " job creation and leadership training for girls in Oakland who face significant barriers to employment," this is definitely a favorite spot now. END
BEGIN NOW   I highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW Mamacitas Cafe is small, just a serving counter on the left. END
BEGIN NOW  and some lounge seats to the right. END
BEGIN NOW another room has tables for laptopers. END
BEGIN NOW  not sure if it's connected to the Cafe or not. END
BEGIN NOW eats: oats or polenta(grits)  choose polenta (12 oz 6. END
BEGIN NOW 95). END
BEGIN NOW brew: red bay coffee (3). END
BEGIN NOW drips:. END
BEGIN NOW In a world overrun with Starbucks, Peet's and Keurig machines that you have to decalcify every 2 minutes (you don't know my struggle so you don't feel my hustle!), a good cup of coffee has become a luxury that too many of us don't get too experience often enough. END
BEGIN NOW  But look no further! Sip on without the shame of knowing your joe was sourced by underpaid laborers and upheld by unfair labor practices! Dunk a delicious donut hole in that cup and know that pastry was made with wholehearted love and passion by women who support fair business practices and use their small business to uplift their community!. END
BEGIN NOW I love everything about Mamacita's, and please believe that the coffee, lavender lemonade and yummy donut kebabs are just the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW  The owners, Shana and Renee, grind super hard for theirs and employ and educate young women in high school on the ins and outs of business ownership along the way by offering opportunities to keep kids occupied and focused. END
BEGIN NOW  They serve up Red Bay Coffee, keeping it fresh, local and delicious while giving back to the hood whenever they can. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't praise them enough!. END
BEGIN NOW My fiancée and I first heard word of Mamacitas Café in the East Bay Express over the summer and appreciated their mission. END
BEGIN NOW  Then when looking for a vendor for our post-wedding picnic they came immediately to mind. END
BEGIN NOW  It was easy as pie to get in touch with them and then for a very fair price they served a lovely selection of their amazing donut kebabs to our assembled guests. END
BEGIN NOW They were there on time, supplied all the gear they needed, and ran a well organized operation. END
BEGIN NOW Both the sweet and savory options were a big hit, along with the hot coffee, iced coffee, iced tea, and lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a dessert or coffee vendor. END
BEGIN NOW I sat with a group of 4. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything was tasty and the service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  They were more than accommodating for our 8 month son. END
BEGIN NOW We shared a chicken and waffle, which was very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  The waffle reminds me of a doughnut and the chicken has a perfectly crispy battery. END
BEGIN NOW I had the vegetable hash and everything was cooked just right: nothing soggy or greasy. END
BEGIN NOW  The red chile sauce was a great compliment to the greens. END
BEGIN NOW Long wait. END
BEGIN NOW   That's to be expected though. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee was good. END
BEGIN NOW I had the waffle with fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   The waffle was better than average but the chicken wasn't great. END
BEGIN NOW   They use chicken breast, which is indisputably the worst cut of meat on the bird. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a tasteless, fat-less cut. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a reason fried chicken joints serve legs and wings. END
BEGIN NOW This is a mixed review regarding the food and the atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   Had the Thursday before Memorial Day off and the choice of Oakland eateries were Mama's  Royal Cafe (a standard on any day of hookie) and Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW   So I choose to pay Auntie a visit. END
BEGIN NOW Service: On point, coffee DELICIOUS!!!  Whatever the jam was. END
BEGIN NOW YAASS!!!. END
BEGIN NOW The not so great. END
BEGIN NOW  The noise level in this place is deafening. END
BEGIN NOW   It was about 11 am and not crowed, but steady. END
BEGIN NOW   Restaurants of today have zero noise cancellation and given the open space, closeness of the kitchen and lots of wood decor the sound is to the point of painful. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered the Corned Beef Hash with Poached Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   I know my corned beef and this was a miss. END
BEGIN NOW   Very little meat and a whole lot of deconstructed cabbage and peppers. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing was together. END
BEGIN NOW   It was like a tiny bit of meat topped with cabbage, onions, some potatoes and the topped with the eggs that were not poached well (running whites). END
BEGIN NOW   Homemade rye bread was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW My last put off was this little note card that explained about the "surcharge". END
BEGIN NOW   Auntie charges a 15% surcharge to help pay for the entire staff. END
BEGIN NOW   You may also leave and additional amount that will go directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW   And like a good Aunt, she has broken down what the extra 3% or 5% for your server would be. END
BEGIN NOW   You read this coming into the restaurant, you read it again at the table and on your tab. END
BEGIN NOW The cost of doing business is just that. END
BEGIN NOW   Whatever you have to pay to keep your place staffed well should be built into the cost of your meals, not let the patron work on supplementing your payroll. END
BEGIN NOW   What will we see next?  PG&E goes up on gas so there is another surcharge to read about if we want hot food or to see the food on the table?. END
BEGIN NOW So, I will not return to Aunt Mary's, and I will instead go visit Mama's. END
BEGIN NOW like everyone should. END
BEGIN NOW We went here with an open mind, but was disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  Food and service were WAY below average. END
BEGIN NOW  And what's up with this 15% mandatory tip? I don't buy this argument that since kitchen staff are making min wage then charge customers more to help the kitchen staff. END
BEGIN NOW  Really? If the owner really cares for his employees, why pay them min wage? Give them a raise man. END
BEGIN NOW  Don't ask customers to compensate for your lack of humanity. END
BEGIN NOW  Total BS. END
BEGIN NOW  We will never go back here and will not recommend it to anyone. END
BEGIN NOW Now here are just 2 examples of the shortfalls regarding the food:. END
BEGIN NOW (1) $15 for 2 hard pancakes with fake cherry jam. END
BEGIN NOW  Really? For the sake of comparison: Bette's diner has the BEST pancakes; price for 2 is $6. END
BEGIN NOW 75 (same size). END
BEGIN NOW  It comes with butter and syrup (and not attitude). END
BEGIN NOW  Who would pay twice as much money for lower quality food/service?. END
BEGIN NOW (2) my poached eggs where raw yuk. END
BEGIN NOW  It's not very hard to make poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  Believe me, just Google it and you'll learn. END
BEGIN NOW I think people who give this place 5 starts should really get out more often. END
BEGIN NOW  Try other breakfast places. END
BEGIN NOW  Any place is better than this (Yes even Denny's). END
BEGIN NOW  The entire experience was way below average. END
BEGIN NOW  The only bright side was my lovely company. END
BEGIN NOW I've had Aunt Mary's bookmarked for sooo long it moved to a new location hahah! (Not far. END
BEGIN NOW only a few blocks down!). END
BEGIN NOW After my experience, I can see why so many people rave about it. END
BEGIN NOW  It's super casual with generous portions. END
BEGIN NOW  Prices are not cheap here, but you are paying for good quality dishes. END
BEGIN NOW  (Kid friendly too - there's toys and books in the waiting area). END
BEGIN NOW Our party of 7 didn't have to wait long early on a Saturday morning (around 9am). END
BEGIN NOW  I put my name down at the front & was told they have a special room upstairs for large parties. END
BEGIN NOW  (I believe your party has to be complete before they will seat you though) We felt like VIPs since we had the whole space to ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW  There was even a bathroom upstairs and couches! KUDOS to our wonderful server to made the endless treks up and down the stairs bringing our food, clearing our plates, refilling our coffee, and checking on us periodically. END
BEGIN NOW I really liked my Southern Bubble and Squeak dish (what a cool name :D) It's basically like gravy, eggs, and mashed potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW simple enough but it was really tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Another memorable dish in the party was Huevos Benedictos but it was way spicer than it looked. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, I was really impressed with the side of pancake ($1. END
BEGIN NOW 75) that came with the Basic Eggs & 2 Sides - so gigantic!. END
BEGIN NOW They were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives but unfortunately I didn't get to try the Pain Perdue this particular visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Yelp pics look amazing though - can't wait to go back for brunch again to try it!! (Only served during weekend brunch). END
BEGIN NOW This is definitely a neighborhood gem and worth a visit if you are in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW Tips: Large parties of 8 or more can call to make reservations before 9am. END
BEGIN NOW  15% auto tip charge on all bills. END
BEGIN NOW  No dinner service. END
BEGIN NOW  No TOGO orders on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW You know when you walk into a place and it just reminds you of a little piece of your past? That happened for me at Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't pinpoint what, but walking in on a later afternoon weekday, to a spacious and airy place, a kind hello and people thoroughly enjoying their food, I knew I was in for a treat. END
BEGIN NOW  A little bit country, a little bit Oakland, this diner is serving up comfort food all day, every day. END
BEGIN NOW  No dinner service here, but they make up for it by offering breakfast until their 3pm closing. END
BEGIN NOW I can see this place being a shit show on weekend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Be patient. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're like me and can enjoy a leisurely weekday meal, as always I suggest that. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the chilaquiles asking for the two accompanying eggs poached and an iced tea and got to using their free wifi. END
BEGIN NOW The iced tea was a bucket. END
BEGIN NOW  Straight up the largest mason jar filled with unsweetened iced tea. END
BEGIN NOW  No need for refills, since I mean, there is so much dang liquid. END
BEGIN NOW  Smart. END
BEGIN NOW The chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  Not like the one from your local taqueria. END
BEGIN NOW  Lacking in elbow grease from an abuela, they were still a treat for the senses. END
BEGIN NOW  The fried tortilla chips perfectly soft, yet still had a hint of crisp served a pretty perfect bed for the eggs, pico, black beans and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW  The side tortillas were even a bit of an overkill. END
BEGIN NOW  The hint of heat from the verde salsa really rounded up this dish. END
BEGIN NOW I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW  15% gratuity is included and divided amongst all staff and you can choose to give more which goes directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm ok with that. END
BEGIN NOW  My one small gripe? This isn't a cheap endeavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Lunch was around $18, not the cheapest meal you've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be back mainly to try more on the menu, especially the hangtown fry-tatta: a frittata with bacon and spinach, topped with fried oysters and fennel slices, drizzled with Rockefeller sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Yep. END
BEGIN NOW  That's the truth right there. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back, for sure. END
BEGIN NOW Their BLT is the best sandwich I have ever eaten, and I am not a sandwich person. END
BEGIN NOW  It's the XL bacon strips and spicy aioli generously spread in between the toasty, buttered sandwich bread with crunchy, fresh lettuce that will make you return for this. END
BEGIN NOW Served with a fresh, green salad NOT overdressed with vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW The other must-try is their oyster po-boy. END
BEGIN NOW  It's fried to crispy deliciousness. END
BEGIN NOW  I love their refillable iced tea and my husband loves their lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW Extremely family friendly - They have high chairs and mommas often come here so you're likely to see a breastfeeding mom or two who'll understand if your kiddo has a meltdown. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure if the bathroom has a changing room. END
BEGIN NOW Call ahead for pick-up if you'd like. END
BEGIN NOW  Tips are automatically included and split among front and back of house staff. END
BEGIN NOW I love this place, I'll be back, and if there's anything bad to be said - it's that the food's so good, it's a popular spot so expect to wait a little to eat, but be rest assured that your taste buds will be excited and you'll remember your meal and be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW I really like the food here. END
BEGIN NOW  The oyster po'boy is especially good. END
BEGIN NOW  Stopped going due to this 15% surcharge business. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't want to feel pressured to leave a tip on top of a forced tip -- which is really what it is, regardless of what they choose to call it. END
BEGIN NOW  Check out the card I found on the table the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW  (Sorry, but Yelp does not have a "rotate" function!). END
BEGIN NOW I have always been a good tipper, and very forgiving of problems that are out of the server's control, so it's not the amount that turns me off, rather the principle. END
BEGIN NOW Sad, because the food is good, though it is a little high, and perhaps that's why they couldn't just up the food prices rather than institute the surcharge. END
BEGIN NOW I'm always exploring breakfast and brunch places in Oakland and, given the reviews I had read, I was highly anticipating a great breakfast/brunch here. END
BEGIN NOW  While everything started great, it was just went downhill from there and I walked out very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW First, the good stuff: It was very busy, but I was still promptly greeted by hostess who handed me the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW  When she saw I was jus one person, she offered me a seat at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW  Once there, I was promptly attended to by a smiling and friendly server, Sasha, who took coffee order and was patient with me while I decided what I wanted for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  My meal, the huevos benedictos, was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  The sauce, not hollandaise, was very spicy, which is great with me! Up until the time Sasha checked on how I liked my meal, she was five stars all the way. END
BEGIN NOW What went wrong?. END
BEGIN NOW A few minutes after I was seated, a second hostess came up to me and said that there was a waiting list, implying that I "cut" in front of everybody on the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW  I told her I tried to get on the list, but another hostess offered me the counter. END
BEGIN NOW  She wanted to know who that was and then she walked away and never said another word to me. END
BEGIN NOW  She was very polite and professional, but I found the encounter offensive, partly because she never apologized. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, she should have checked with the other hostesses before confronting with me. END
BEGIN NOW The other issues were minor. END
BEGIN NOW  My server never offered to refill my coffee, I had to ask twice. END
BEGIN NOW  She dropped off my bill with a polite comment and was gone before I could say anything to her - without ever asking me if I wanted anything else, which I did. END
BEGIN NOW Service is as important to me as the food and this was a bad experience, primarily because of the second hostess, not the server. END
BEGIN NOW  Because the food was good, I may try it again someday. END
BEGIN NOW Came here for brunch once with my sister, dad and niece. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone seemed to like their food, including my picky 3-year-old niece. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Grilled Flank Steak Sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW  The flavors were great, but my meat was so tough!!!!! It was so awkward to eat because I couldn't rip off a piece and all of it would just come flying out of the bread. END
BEGIN NOW  If the steak wasn't so hard, this sandwich would've been amazing and would've changed how many stars I'm giving this place. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried my sister's catfish sandwich and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Should have gotten that. END
BEGIN NOW They have an interesting and unique menu which makes me want to come back and try some more. END
BEGIN NOW After receiving a recommendation of this spot from a co worker, we decided to check it out as we were still looking out for a signature breakfast spot in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW   We came here for Sunday brunch and found ourselves only waiting for about  15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW   We ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW Lemon ricotta cornmeal pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW Side of spicy pork sausage. END
BEGIN NOW Pain perdu. END
BEGIN NOW Sadly, everything was no more than mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW   The sauce that was served with the pancakes was crazy overpowering. END
BEGIN NOW   It would have been better served without. END
BEGIN NOW   The pancakes, alone, tasted great. END
BEGIN NOW The homemade sausage, while I appreciated it, was overcooked and dry. END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey pain perdu fell short. END
BEGIN NOW   After a bite or two, I was over it. END
BEGIN NOW   It looked better than it tasted. END
BEGIN NOW Service also fell short. END
BEGIN NOW   It was difficult to find someone to ask for our check or get a refill on water and coffee. END
BEGIN NOW   3 stars at most. END
BEGIN NOW I have to say im only judging off my food experience here. END
BEGIN NOW  I was with a table of 5 and everyone agreed my food was definitely the worst. END
BEGIN NOW  So. END
BEGIN NOW The bisquits and gravy taste more like bisquit and paste. END
BEGIN NOW  A paste that gives a hint of glue. END
BEGIN NOW No salt added whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW  I mean NONE. END
BEGIN NOW  Possibly the blandest biscuit and gravy I've ever witnessed. END
BEGIN NOW  So much for being whisked away to my childhood. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  No. END
BEGIN NOW $15 for that atrocity. END
BEGIN NOW I tasted the waffle of my friends. END
BEGIN NOW  On point. END
BEGIN NOW  Chicken was good too. END
BEGIN NOW The fried oysters-doable. END
BEGIN NOW Minus 1 star for having a menu that actually says  "maple flavored syrup" or actual "maple syrup" for $3. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW no. END
BEGIN NOW  Just serve maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW The service was just ok too. END
BEGIN NOW  I mean I probably wouldnt go back but it's worth a try if your in the area. END
BEGIN NOW Aunt Mary's is a solid place for breakfast and brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Although their specialty items are a little more expensive, they're pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   I enjoyed the posole verde. END
BEGIN NOW   Good pancakes too. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't like the chicken fried steak too much, I thought the meat was a little rubbery, but the chile sauce on top was good. END
BEGIN NOW   Ingredients are fresh and portions are generous. END
BEGIN NOW Amazing food and service. END
BEGIN NOW    I saw this place on Diners and Dives and was sold when they showed how to make Shrimp and Grits. END
BEGIN NOW    After visiting our daughter on Mothers day weekend, we got up early to avoid the breakfast rush. END
BEGIN NOW   They opened at 8:00. END
BEGIN NOW   We were greeted and asked to sit where we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW   This area and restaurant setting reminded us of Portland, Oregon. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved it. END
BEGIN NOW   I of course had to try the Shrimp and Grits, which was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   We watched other food pass by and everything looked amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   You must try Aunt Mary's!. END
BEGIN NOW I have many happy memories of this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Great appetizers and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   They have $1 oysters for happy hour and they are always fresh and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  They serve a lot of cool condiments with them that are fun to try and are taste tantalizing. END
BEGIN NOW  If you never had raw oysters before, this is a good place to try it first, because they are small and mild. END
BEGIN NOW  I also highly recommend their deviled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  I am not crazy about their chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW that is one dish I would not recommend. END
BEGIN NOW They have a large selection of wines and the waiters really know what their stuff in case you need help choosing the right drink for your mood. END
BEGIN NOW  No matter how busy they get I've never had an issue with the wait staff and we always were able to get a seat somehow, though we usually get there early. END
BEGIN NOW Where do I start? I had a detailed review in my head but then realized it was long and would have been a rant, so I will just give pluses and minuses and be brief. END
BEGIN NOW Started out as a nice warm Oakland evening at the beginning of a three day weekend and looking forward to relaxing with great food and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks, yes, they were great: sidecar and petit pomme. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice wine list too. END
BEGIN NOW Started with the roasted cauliflower and baby kale to share. END
BEGIN NOW  The cauliflower was not cooked, and the dish was barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW  Server said it was not intended to be hot. END
BEGIN NOW  We took two bites of raw cauliflower, and she took it away-not going to eat raw cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW  The sauce was rather bland as well. END
BEGIN NOW  Very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW Next came our steak and sliders. END
BEGIN NOW  The sliders they got right although the buns were a little dry. END
BEGIN NOW  I could easily overlook this. END
BEGIN NOW  The steak was cooked just right, and the sauce was good, but again the dish came to us barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW  Is this a new thing I just don't know about?  I like my food served hot from pan or grill to plate to table. END
BEGIN NOW Our fries to share never came; we had to ask for them. END
BEGIN NOW  When they did arrive, they were great-perfectly cooked and seasoned, temp was just right, and aioli was better than most. END
BEGIN NOW  Still disappointing since we had already finished our mains. END
BEGIN NOW  Would have been nice to enjoy both at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh well. END
BEGIN NOW Service was aloof and uneven. END
BEGIN NOW  They had a crowd but not too busy so there was no reason for delayed service. END
BEGIN NOW  If the kitchen is having timing issues, the server just didn't seem concerned. END
BEGIN NOW  I felt like we just had to take what we got with no apologies, just drop the plate at the table and run. END
BEGIN NOW  There are some nice sounding dishes on the menu I would like to try, but I don't think that will happen any time soon. END
BEGIN NOW This is not my place; I will not return. END
BEGIN NOW Pesto pizza, chicken wings, ceviche, wine tasting, cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  My ladies and I had a great night there sharing dinner and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Busy lively atmosphere for late 20-30-40 somethings. END
BEGIN NOW I would definitely recommend to others and go back for Friday night happenings. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was great and service was great!. END
BEGIN NOW Whooooooaaaa there Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  How have I NOT written a review for one of my favorite happy hours in the East Bay? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  I genuinely love their happy hour offerings and the food for that is also delish. END
BEGIN NOW  De. END
BEGIN NOW  Lish. END
BEGIN NOW  Umph. END
BEGIN NOW I actually discovered District's amazing happy hour on a pub crawl. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes. END
BEGIN NOW  That have happy hour on Saturdays. END
BEGIN NOW  You're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW  So once you've had brunch, with bottomless mimosas, started to sober up, and don't want to. END
BEGIN NOW come here. END
BEGIN NOW The tables fill up mostly due to reservations. END
BEGIN NOW  #protip. END
BEGIN NOW But, if you can find yourself at the bar, then go for it. END
BEGIN NOW  Minus a star because the service can be (okay, probably will be) slow. END
BEGIN NOW  But, no one is perfect right?. END
BEGIN NOW The menu includes $6 house wine, beers, well drinks, and my favorite the food (see photo for menu). END
BEGIN NOW  $6 for 6 oysters, yes. END
BEGIN NOW  Recommendation: go with the truffle fries. END
BEGIN NOW  They are cooked to order so they are not cold. END
BEGIN NOW  They come seasoned with salt, pepper, and what I believe is Rosemary (listed as herbs and truffle Parmesan aioli), ketchup, and the dipping sauce aforementioned. END
BEGIN NOW It's walkable from 12th street BART and then you can explore old Oakland, head to Jack London Square, or off to the Fox Theatre and Uptown. END
BEGIN NOW  I love it here and definitely recommend it for a stop along the way or a place for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW District isn't a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a wine bar with food. END
BEGIN NOW   We failed to know this. END
BEGIN NOW Their menu consists of small plates and pizzas. END
BEGIN NOW   The bf and I ordered six dishes and that was too much. END
BEGIN NOW   Stick to about two dishes per person and you should be good. END
BEGIN NOW   If not, order as you go. END
BEGIN NOW MUST TRY:. END
BEGIN NOW The two standout dishes of the night were the tempura avocado and the sliced hanger steak. END
BEGIN NOW   The tempura avocado had a light and crispy exterior, topped with chili lime salt (which was phenomenal), and served with a roasted jalapeno aioli sauce for dipping. END
BEGIN NOW   The hanger steak was so tender that it melts in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW   The topping was that it was served with chimichurri sauce. END
BEGIN NOW OTHER FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW *The raw oysters were medium size and served with a mignonette sauce and fresh horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW   They do have $1 oysters (opposed to $2. END
BEGIN NOW 50 each) during happy hour (weekdays 4-6pm). END
BEGIN NOW *The steak tartare was okay. END
BEGIN NOW   The bf wasn't a big fan as it was tangier than other places. END
BEGIN NOW   One of the biggest mistakes with the dish was the egg. END
BEGIN NOW   Unlike most places that serve it with a raw egg on top, District's version cooks their egg. END
BEGIN NOW   My egg was more cooked than in pictures I've seen on Yelp and lacked that yolky gooiness. END
BEGIN NOW *The margherita pizza had a nice thin crust and was perfect for sharing. END
BEGIN NOW   It was topped with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good but it needed more tomatoes or tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Service was nice but staff was often missing so it took a long time getting what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW   There was a bit of a timing issue with food arrival. END
BEGIN NOW   The pace in the beginning was good as we had food in front of us but not to the point of taking up all table room). END
BEGIN NOW   There was so much time between the last couple dishes that food had settled and we were too full. END
BEGIN NOW Depending on the size of your party, make a reservation on Opentable. END
BEGIN NOW   If reservations aren't made, seating is free for all which we lucked out with. END
BEGIN NOW   District has a limited number of reservations because there is a limited amount of seating. END
BEGIN NOW   Though it's a big place, most of the area is taken for bar seating and lounge areas. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT TO KNOW:. END
BEGIN NOW *Full bar. END
BEGIN NOW *Take advantage of their happy hour specials from 4-6pm. END
BEGIN NOW *Street parking or a paid lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW My friend and I went to district to watch the warriors game last night and had a horrifying experience. END
BEGIN NOW  I asked the bartender to place a order for food and drinks, he rolled his eyes and said I'm kinda busy ( tall large white male). END
BEGIN NOW My friend who I was with (white) went outside after the game as we waited on the bill to take a call from a Ill family member. END
BEGIN NOW  I went outside to let her know that the bill was ready. END
BEGIN NOW  The manager John ran outside in full stride after me and yelled in front of everybody outside you are banned you are banned for skipping out on your bill. END
BEGIN NOW  I explained to him I was getting her to come pay her portion but he continued to yell that I was banned. END
BEGIN NOW  We gave him our cards and proceeded to walk behind him. END
BEGIN NOW  He told the security not to let me in while he charged our cards. END
BEGIN NOW  When he returned he threw bill holder at my friend with our cards in it which fell on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW  As we checked the bill he charged us double and refused to let us back in to discuss it. END
BEGIN NOW  I have never been so disrespected at an establishment in all my life. END
BEGIN NOW One of those rare places that does a number of things well, whether it's serving up weekend brunch, offering daily drinks and dinner, or morphing into a thumpin' hangout on late weekend nights. END
BEGIN NOW No matter what the environment is, the ambience is friendly, casual, diverse, and welcoming in a uniquely Oakland way. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunches here, in particular, are a laid-back way of easing into your weekend day, and there's a wide array of scrumptious offerings to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW  Seems like half of Oakland is here too, all with smiling faces. END
BEGIN NOW Can't go wrong with this place no matter the purpose. END
BEGIN NOW  Highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW My friend wanted to try this place and I was down to because they had $1 oysters. END
BEGIN NOW   When I entered, I stood their awkwardly trying to find a waiter to seat me. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't know that you actually seat yourself. END
BEGIN NOW  (Remember this! So you don't awkwardly stand there and wait for someone to come). END
BEGIN NOW  Once we sat down, it took them awhile to come to the table. END
BEGIN NOW  The service here is extremely slow. END
BEGIN NOW  The food service is fine. END
BEGIN NOW  But grabbing the waiter's attention is extremely difficult. END
BEGIN NOW I tried the following:. END
BEGIN NOW Peach Bellini: it was good! But not much for $6. END
BEGIN NOW  I finished it quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  So ordered the next drink. END
BEGIN NOW Grapefruit beer: it was delicious! I wanted to order another one but I was kind of full. END
BEGIN NOW Oysters: they were good. END
BEGIN NOW  They waiter asked if we wanted Tabasco and I said yes but they never brought it out. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken wings: there were 5 wings and they were a lot smaller than I expected. END
BEGIN NOW  It came out on a cute little cast iron skillet. END
BEGIN NOW  The wings were good but I didn't like the sauce it came with. END
BEGIN NOW I would return for the food but only if I have a lot of time because of their service. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking in that area isn't difficult either so that's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW It's really more of a 3. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars since it was slightly  over average. END
BEGIN NOW   We came here for appetizers on a Saturday night and it had a pretty good vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Great mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW We started with the deviled eggs to wet our appetites. END
BEGIN NOW   Creamy egg with a hint heat from the sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW   Next was the Brussel sprouts which were roasted and blended well with the cider brown butter and almonds. END
BEGIN NOW   We had them hold the pancetta since we were vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW   Last we had the fontina and spinach arancini which was on a bed of spicy tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   All very good. END
BEGIN NOW I think we will go back and try it for dinner next time. END
BEGIN NOW I've been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW  The first time was lovely, but the second time (last night) was ruined by the female Africa American late 20s, maybe 30ish, bright pink lipstick server who seemed so annoyed by having to get us a couple of drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  All simple questions were answered with a perplexing huffiness. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't think we did anything to set her off, but it was like she hated us the minute we walked in, and there's no place for that in this business. END
BEGIN NOW  Or this world really. END
BEGIN NOW The bartenders were great, and though we had a table we just started going to them directly to avoid her odd wrath. END
BEGIN NOW Another plus - gorgeous art!. END
BEGIN NOW This place was great!. END
BEGIN NOW Le bf, me, and one of our good couple friends stumbled in here after first getting some beers at The Trappist and some nomz at the Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW  My bf was on the hunt for some oysters and he saw a sign advertising them here! Sold. END
BEGIN NOW The sign advertised $1 oysters at happy hour which we missed (darnit!), but their normal price was $2. END
BEGIN NOW 75. END
BEGIN NOW  My bf and his friend ended up splitting a plate of about 10 oysters with a few beers between them while I got a glass of champagne and split the bread pudding with le other gf. END
BEGIN NOW The food was great! I'm not a huge fan of oysters in general but these were fresh and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread pudding wasn't the best I've ever had but was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Was kind of pricey but was also kind of a "scene" type place. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, we really enjoyed posting up and having a few drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW  I would definitely come back here and try more of the food! I think at happy hour (with happy hour prices), this would be a great spot I would actively seek out. END
BEGIN NOW During my first year of working in Oakland, I would, on average, about once a week, take a lunchtime walk from our office at City Center to Jack London Square, usually approaching via Chinatown and Webster Street while returning via Old Town and Washington Street. END
BEGIN NOW  In the latter area, I've been to Pacific Coast Brewing Company a couple of times, I've glanced at the used bookstore, and have made frequent passages through Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW  Also noticed have been a handful of somewhat trendy-looking bars, just awaiting for me to make an appearance. END
BEGIN NOW Finally, as it often happens, I wind up at a wonderful new location almost by accident. END
BEGIN NOW  A couple of weeks ago we were supposed to meet at another bar about a half block away. END
BEGIN NOW  For whatever reason, however, that location was not open when it said it would be. END
BEGIN NOW  Its loss and The District's gain. END
BEGIN NOW  Or, more precisely, our gain - we now have a reliable standby to go to after a day of putting up with the powers that be. END
BEGIN NOW  Comfy seats at right angles with room for small plates to share, the environment is just made for socializing - public but not too loud; active but with the ability to move around freely. END
BEGIN NOW  Plus the place has a good selection of brews, hard alcohol, and after work food - I recommend the shrimp pizza with chorizo, with a Raging Bitch to wash it down. END
BEGIN NOW  Even though it's not technically on the menu, our waitress complied with my request of an irish coffee, by improvising with Jamesons, and of course, coffee. END
BEGIN NOW So, a week later, one of the bigwigs at work decided that, for whoever wanted to take him up on the offer, we should do a pubcrawl through Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  It says volumes that this crawl began and ended at The District. END
BEGIN NOW District never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW  The food and libations are strictly top quality and the staff are very friendly for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW  The only thing on the menu that I've tried and felt "meh" about was the pesto mozzarella pizza. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty bland. END
BEGIN NOW I also had the chance to host my birthday festivities at District. END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone in my party was treated promptly and the servers made sure my night was special. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't even have to reserve a couch, I just showed up early with part of my group. END
BEGIN NOW  The space was a little small for my party (around 23 people) but we made it work and stayed out the way (or tried to). END
BEGIN NOW I booked a table at Bellanico's this week, looking for a restaurant that offered great, authentic Italian food, a great environment and a baby friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW   They delivered!. END
BEGIN NOW When we arrived they had a table for four adults and a high chair ready for us, a little offset from the rest of the dining room which was much appreciated. END
BEGIN NOW   Right off the bat, our waiter was courteous, knowledgeable and professional. END
BEGIN NOW   He was present when we needed him but not overbearing - just the right balance. END
BEGIN NOW   Most importantly, he was patient with our group taking some time to reach decisions as he was with a 2-year old walking around the table non-stop. END
BEGIN NOW Our food was outright excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   Cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned and immaculately presented. END
BEGIN NOW   The menu presents a wide array of choices to satisfy wide arrays of preferences, which we needed for our group. END
BEGIN NOW   There are many appetizers to choose from, of which many also cater well to being shared as a group. END
BEGIN NOW   In main courses, there are several pasta and non-pastas to choose from, and they all look delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW As a trained sommelier, I was happy to see that the diversity of the menu was reflected in the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW   It's mostly Italian, and reflects all of the major wine producing areas - not a generic list of 15 different Chiantis. END
BEGIN NOW   We chose the Aglianico del Vulture which was I was happy to find - I think it's the first time I've seen it at a restaurant in California. END
BEGIN NOW   The list also has wines from France and Spain. END
BEGIN NOW I've been looking for restaurant that has all of the above for sometime, and I am happy I found Bellanico's. END
BEGIN NOW   We will be visiting many more times. END
BEGIN NOW Just had a very awkward exchange with the lady behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not sure if it's the way I look or was dressed but every question I had was returned with a confused look. END
BEGIN NOW  Do you accept credit for gift certificates? I thought that was a valid question because some stores only allow debit or cash payment for gift cards. END
BEGIN NOW  Can I use your phone to call my brother to make sure the gift certificate is addressed right? Another perplexed look. END
BEGIN NOW  Then I was handed the receipt where there was a section for tip, I'll chalk this one up to how the system is set up but they may want to exclude a tip section for buying a gift card. END
BEGIN NOW I live up the street and if I was more impressed with this place, I would go more. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes, the food is really good. END
BEGIN NOW  Portions are very small. END
BEGIN NOW  If My girlfriend and I were to walk out of here with a drink and a full stomach, we wouldn't leave paying less than a $100 and that's probably without tip. END
BEGIN NOW We've had good service here before and the food is tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Three stars for that. END
BEGIN NOW  Minus two stars for the way I was treated this past time and the small portion size and no beer on tap (I get it, it's a wine place but have at least one beer, this is California). END
BEGIN NOW Been several times. END
BEGIN NOW  Always good. END
BEGIN NOW  Looked at menu at competitor down the street. END
BEGIN NOW  Big ass television for Warrior game. END
BEGIN NOW  No thank you. END
BEGIN NOW  That's what sports bars and living rooms are created to accommodate. END
BEGIN NOW  Italian meals are about good food, conversations, and no cell phones. END
BEGIN NOW  Went back to Bellancio-no reservation, but early for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  Seated promptly. END
BEGIN NOW  Fried green olives - more addicting than crack. END
BEGIN NOW  Had a Negroni and an Aperol spritz ( my wife) Great wine from Montalcatino. END
BEGIN NOW  Best pork chop ever! Service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Almost had a Tony Soprano moment. END
BEGIN NOW  Why do you hipsters and no etiquette knowing men wear your stupid baseball hats indoors and in a dinner house? My wife kept one of you from a good stare-down and punch out from a former Marine having dinner on Memorial Day. END
BEGIN NOW Restaurant Week Review!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW Bellanico has a phenomenal menu, and they have really chosen a tasting menu that shows off the diversity of the dishes they offer. END
BEGIN NOW  I *almost* came back for lunch today, but decided to try a different menu solely for the sake of variety. END
BEGIN NOW  The space is very warm and inviting; it reminded us of being in a small cafe in Europe. END
BEGIN NOW  The servers were really nice, and the owner spent time walking around and making sure everything was going o. END
BEGIN NOW k. END
BEGIN NOW  without being too obtrusive; he obviously cares a lot about his customers' experience. END
BEGIN NOW The menu started out with two small appetizers, both practically bite-size. END
BEGIN NOW  They were a nice start to the menu; they provided a small tasting and good flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Next followed the "primi" course; we chose "tombo tuna" and "braised lamb belly. END
BEGIN NOW " While probably the weakest course on the menu, the proteins in each of these dishes were still really good. END
BEGIN NOW  We were not super happy with the chickpeas in the tuna dish or the red mustard in the lamb belly, but aside from those two items, both dishes were still strong. END
BEGIN NOW The secondi dishes were very strong; we ordered the ono (turned out to be trout) and pork tenderloin. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork tenderloin was the star dish of the night; I would *HIGHLY* recommend ordering it. END
BEGIN NOW  The trout was also pretty good, although probably fishier than the ono would have been. END
BEGIN NOW For desert, you will get a sampling of deserts (unless you are here for lunch, in case you will have to choose). END
BEGIN NOW  The espresso panna cotta and hazelnut cakes were both really, really good; I would have a tough time choosing between them. END
BEGIN NOW  The hazelnut cake came warm from the oven and with homemade ice cream: yum! The cheesecake had a very strong goat aftertaste. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, we were very happy with our decision to try this great little cafe for restaurant week!. END
BEGIN NOW This was my first visit to this cute neighborhood gem. END
BEGIN NOW  I was quite impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Buzzy warm vibe on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW  Smaller restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating (enclosed patio with heaters). END
BEGIN NOW The menu was impressive because it was very unique. END
BEGIN NOW  Not your typical Italian eatery. END
BEGIN NOW  A lot to explore. END
BEGIN NOW  They also offer the option of a fix prix menu or a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW  We opted for a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW We began with the tuna crudo with watermelon radish and grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW  To accompany this appetizer we got the warm farro with hen of the woods mushrooms, cranberries, and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW  A fantastic pairing to share with the tuna crudo!. END
BEGIN NOW Next, we shared the pasta with tomatoe sauce and hot peppers. END
BEGIN NOW  A super cool feature that they offer is the option to order dishes as appetizer or entree size! I love this because it gives you a lot of freedom. END
BEGIN NOW  You can order a bunch of dishes and share them rather than just having one entree. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun!. END
BEGIN NOW Then there is the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW  Again, I was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW  Wines offered from many regions. END
BEGIN NOW  We explored some cool Italian whites and reds. END
BEGIN NOW  And once again, they allow you to order half or full glasses. END
BEGIN NOW  And they have a full menu of wine tasting flights. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun, fun, fun!. END
BEGIN NOW Our server was fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun guy, originally from Mexico, who clearly loves what he does. END
BEGIN NOW  Passionate. END
BEGIN NOW  Attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  Knowledgeable. END
BEGIN NOW  And just fun to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW We ended our meal with the most delicious goat cheese cheescake. END
BEGIN NOW  That was a first. END
BEGIN NOW and boy was it amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  Covered with pistachio toffee crumbles and paired with strawberries. END
BEGIN NOW  I would go back just to order that again. END
BEGIN NOW We will return. END
BEGIN NOW  Bravo. END
BEGIN NOW Finally. END
BEGIN NOW   OMG finally. END
BEGIN NOW   An Italian restaurant I can finally love coming too. END
BEGIN NOW   It's been a long, hard battle to even find a decent meal in the Bay Area, and I found my gem in the most boring part of this area. END
BEGIN NOW   Who would have guessed. END
BEGIN NOW Everything, from start to finish, was stellar. END
BEGIN NOW   Just complex enough to make you feel special, and simple enough where it felt casual. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect!  The $40 fix price menu is a steal. END
BEGIN NOW   We did that with an additional app, and a main, and the portions were right on. END
BEGIN NOW   The chocolate pot de creme desert. END
BEGIN NOW whoa. END
BEGIN NOW it's like a lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW on par with Angelines chocolate pot de creme and Chez Mama's choco lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW I will be back here again, and again. END
BEGIN NOW   It's simply stellar Italian. END
BEGIN NOW   Yes it's not a hip part of town, yes there are all old people in here, if you drove by you'd think some local dump restaurant that people go to because it's convenient. END
BEGIN NOW   You'd be wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Only miss:  I went to brunch before, and was not impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   At all. END
BEGIN NOW   I was skeptical when the gf said this is her fave place. END
BEGIN NOW   But after dinner, I took back my insults from the brunch. END
BEGIN NOW Three stars because this neighborhood needs one remaining place you can get a decent glass of wine in a cute setting. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is challenging. END
BEGIN NOW   Perhaps if you stick to apps and drinks you'll be alright, but the mains, in my experience, vary from over salted to mushy, to flavorless. END
BEGIN NOW  Good luck. END
BEGIN NOW I have no idea how Bellanico received it's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I was deceived. END
BEGIN NOW To summarize: great service, cute spot, feels over-crowded, food is not good and I will never come back. END
BEGIN NOW What we ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW Duck Pate - literally slabs of pate on toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Presentation was terrible and the pate taste off. END
BEGIN NOW Pork belly- not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW  It came on a skewer of chewy pork belly and fingerling potatoes and I liked the potatoes more. END
BEGIN NOW Ribeye - OK steak but nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW  Temperature was correct and came with bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW Being the snazzy little Yelper I am, I snagged a 6 pm reservation on the last day of Restaurant Week (truth: Mr. END
BEGIN NOW  P knew exactly what would brighten my day and stumbled across an abandoned reservation on Open Table). END
BEGIN NOW  This area can be a little limited in parking, so give yourself some extra time. END
BEGIN NOW Romantic lighting, enclosed patio seating, new silverware between each course. END
BEGIN NOW  this is a very nice date night with all the lovely details without being pretentious. END
BEGIN NOW  Very attentive and kind staff who put up with all my batty questions and gave me great suggestions. END
BEGIN NOW  (For whatever reason I have the hardest time figuring out what is on Italian menus unless it's crystal clear. END
BEGIN NOW  Agnolotti, tortelli, sformato. END
BEGIN NOW  err. END
BEGIN NOW ). END
BEGIN NOW I could slowly talk you through bite by bite, but I'm going to just get to the point. END
BEGIN NOW  The bacala was my absolute favorite, and I could probably eat the dark and white panna cotta every day for the rest of my life. END
BEGIN NOW  I think whatever you order here will be a delightful culinary experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Also it doesn't hurt coming here during restaurant week when you can indulge for just $30 per person. END
BEGIN NOW  Such a steal!. END
BEGIN NOW What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant! Bellanico is a local gem that has stellar service to match their scrumptious menu. END
BEGIN NOW We came here on a lazy Sunday with our two young kids. END
BEGIN NOW  They were offering their Oakland Restaurant week brunch menu for $24, to which you can add wine pairing for $10. END
BEGIN NOW Here's what we tried:. END
BEGIN NOW Burrata with roasted baby beets -- they make their own burrata, which works really well with the Grillo white paired with it. END
BEGIN NOW Braised and seared pork belly -- loved the crispy skin and tender meat, specially with the "Merlau" red. END
BEGIN NOW Poached eggs and prosciutto on country bread -- liked this version of Eggs Benedict, paired with a Bordeaux blanc. END
BEGIN NOW Butternut squash and goat cheese frittata -- fluffy and creamy, yet quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW  Paired well with a Loire white blend. END
BEGIN NOW Dark and white chocolate panna cotta -- rich and creamy. END
BEGIN NOW Florentine doughnuts - our kids loved this with the sage custard sauce and chocolate dip. END
BEGIN NOW  Only problem was that there were only 5 small pieces for $8. END
BEGIN NOW Goat cheese cheesecake with pistachio brittle -- my fave dessert, love the savory cheese with the crunchy brittle. END
BEGIN NOW Our brunch also came with complimentary muffins. END
BEGIN NOW  My kids loved these and our server was gracious enough to provide us with another helping! Overall, we highly recommend Bellanico and look forward to coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW Parking: It was a little tough and hard to find street parking. END
BEGIN NOW  Luckily on Sunday we found a few spots and parking was free. END
BEGIN NOW  With my handicapped brother it was also hard to find any parking near the hotel for easier access. END
BEGIN NOW  There were a few loading zone spots out front (handicapped can park there for as long as needed!) So if you have anyone that needs to be closer, that could work. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! So glad I chose this place for my birthday brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  I was able to make reservations a week in advance for a party of 7. END
BEGIN NOW  We got an excellent view of the lake and I really enjoyed the glass windows and interiors. END
BEGIN NOW  They had live jazz music playing as well! Impressive! Their Irish coffee is strong! Be forewarned!!! I needed a nap after. END
BEGIN NOW  I enjoyed the food as well, splitting a classic mushroom omelette and biscuits and gravy with my boyfriend. END
BEGIN NOW  They were able to do a side pancake for me which was nice since that was unlisted on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  I also tried a bit of the Jack London omelette, which had delicious chunks of crab in it. END
BEGIN NOW All in all its a great place to bring your family and they take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW  Good views, good food and good service. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect for special occasions or if you want a nice fancier atmosphere for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW We reserved a table for 4 people here on Saturday via opentable. END
BEGIN NOW  However, when we arrived it was clear they didn't want us there. END
BEGIN NOW  Even though we had a reservation, they didn't even ask our names. END
BEGIN NOW  Instead the hostess rudely quipped 'if you want to sit down you'll have to order within 2 minutes, we have an event today. END
BEGIN NOW ' We tried to explain we had a reservation and by now a few team members had come over but only to give us a similarly rude message 'if your party isn't here very soon, they can't order'. END
BEGIN NOW  We quickly left. END
BEGIN NOW This could all have been avoided by simply not accepting a reservation that you can't service, and when it happens - be nice about it. END
BEGIN NOW Coming to celebrate a graduation, we came to The Terrace Room for brunch as a big group on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW  With the exception of the view, I'd say the place is pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW Part I: The Untrained Waitress. END
BEGIN NOW Although the waitress was nice, she had no clue about the menu, how to properly pour a champagne and the fact that water should be refilled for clients. END
BEGIN NOW  Not only did she overpour the champagne glass, but managed to hold the bottle as if she is pouring vodka after a day at a Russian sauna (holding it with a grasp at the neck). END
BEGIN NOW  Didn't leave the cork on the table either. END
BEGIN NOW  Anyways, she didn't even know that Mumm sparkling wine was on the menu and I had to point her directly to it. END
BEGIN NOW  I mean, it's a brunch restaurant, there are 3 sparkling wines on the menu, does one really need a curriculum to learn them? Unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW Part II: The Standard Menu. END
BEGIN NOW Moving on, the menu is pretty average and the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't anything to make me brag about this spot to a friend, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Crab eggs Benedict and it was fine. END
BEGIN NOW  Another person at our table had the chorizo omelet and had similar impressions. END
BEGIN NOW Part III: The Shining. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, there is an area where they shine and I am confident they already know it. END
BEGIN NOW  The view from the table is killer, overlooking the lake, it just adds a relaxing feel to the whole establishment. END
BEGIN NOW  Good spot for family pictures. END
BEGIN NOW Conclusion:. END
BEGIN NOW Would I come back? Perhaps, if I ran out of other options to try, but it's an average restaurant with an above average view. END
BEGIN NOW  Had the waitress been better versed in the service industry, I would have given 4 stars for the view and food. END
BEGIN NOW We were here last night again for the Y's yearly Annual Campaign Victory dinner and I was looking forward to the beautiful view, spending time with friends and having a wonderful meal. END
BEGIN NOW   I can say that I had all three but there were some rude glitches along the way. END
BEGIN NOW   Dinner wasn't served until around 6:45 or 7 so we had a chance to have something to drink at the bar and chat with our friends. END
BEGIN NOW I used my yelp check-in and noticed that I could get $3 off any happy hour food or drinks so I showed the bartender my yelp check-in. END
BEGIN NOW   She indicated that if I was part of the Y event, that I could not use my happy hour check-in; however, I was paying for my alcoholic drink and it was not part of the banquet we were attending as other patrons were in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   That didn't seem fair to me. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I was able to get my discount for my drink. END
BEGIN NOW   Then later during the dinner, one of my friends at our table, asked for some ketchup and the waiter rudely indicated that ketchup was not part of the banquet menu, what????. END
BEGIN NOW Then when the delicious dessert was being served, the waiter was asking us who wanted coffee, another friend asked for his cup to be filled but he only had his cup filled 1/4?  I asked the same waiter for some coffee and mine was full. END
BEGIN NOW   This is the same waiter who refused to give another friend at our table ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know the wait staff was so rude. END
BEGIN NOW   I have never had a bad experience with the wait staff here at The Terrace Room. END
BEGIN NOW Going here transports me back to a by-gone era. END
BEGIN NOW  It's so easy sitting in this place to imagine how it was in the 20s. END
BEGIN NOW  It's especially nice when the sun is out and you get that nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  They have live music a lot, which obviously aligns with that historical period. END
BEGIN NOW  All this adds up to a really unique, fun and relaxing ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW They have pretty awesome drink specials when the do have happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW  If you ask me, they need to extend their happy hours a bit, as the place is never mobbed or anything. END
BEGIN NOW  It probably won't ever be a very trendy place as it IS inside a retirement home ;-) It's actually pretty neat on swing nights seeing the 20 somethings who are into swing cause it's cool again mix with the folks that dug it when it was cool originally. END
BEGIN NOW Although this place shares a building with a senior living center, it doesn't smell like old people. END
BEGIN NOW  Lol! They have a lounge area before entering the restaurant part with a piano which was dope. END
BEGIN NOW  Esp since there was someone there playing. END
BEGIN NOW The view of the lake is really what you're paying for here. END
BEGIN NOW  Our waitress, Brittany, was very professional and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  She was upbeat and prompt with anything we needed. END
BEGIN NOW  Loved how our champagne was never empty for too long. END
BEGIN NOW  $17 for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. END
BEGIN NOW  The + about this place is you can switch off between the two. END
BEGIN NOW  And they had a bloody mary bar for you to have fun with. END
BEGIN NOW The food was a little disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  The brunch menu was a bit limited and the quality of the food was below what it's worth. END
BEGIN NOW  However, they had a cute basket of mini muffins that were tasty and moist which was different from other brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW All in all it was good to try this place out. END
BEGIN NOW  I wouldn't mind coming here again but it would be for the view. END
BEGIN NOW  While the food wasn't horrible, there's nothing exciting about it either. END
BEGIN NOW This was a second dinner option selection due to a nearby restaurant that was closed for a private party. END
BEGIN NOW  Unfortunately we made the wrong choice and ate here. END
BEGIN NOW Yes it has an amazing view of Lake Merritt, but other than that this place doesn't have anything going to for them. END
BEGIN NOW The menu is small, I ordered the soup of the day which was mushroom creme, it was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing special and was somewhat separated. END
BEGIN NOW  For an entree I ordered roasted chicken that came with some kind of rice and scallions ($25) with a side of there potatoes ($6). END
BEGIN NOW  When the dish came it looked awful to begin with and was swimming in a pool of oil. END
BEGIN NOW  The roasted chicken was a pale skin color all over and had a lot of gristle. END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention is was two dark meat pieces (legs) the cheapest part of chicken meat. END
BEGIN NOW  The potatoes where whole but needed some sort of sauce that was absent. END
BEGIN NOW  The grains on the dish had a nice flavor but the greens and chicken were so overpowered by oil that it was difficult to enjoy any of this dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW The servers were friendly but it was unclear who our actual server was and we seemed to be seen mostly by the host who was busy seating. END
BEGIN NOW  It was not until the end of our meal that anyone checked in about how the experience was or if we need refills on drinks or water. END
BEGIN NOW Now, about an hour later our group has all ended up in the bathroom and. END
BEGIN NOW  How do I say this nicely. END
BEGIN NOW  But our stomachs are in a lot of pain and it's a good thing we like each other because there's some serious gas and bathroom time happening. END
BEGIN NOW This is the place for a girl's brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  First of all the lighting is amazing so all those selfies you're pretending you're not planning on taking will look INCREDIBLE. END
BEGIN NOW  The brunch options are diverse and doesn't have to kill your budget. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is a bit hit or miss, though. END
BEGIN NOW  My first time here I got the breakfast bagel sandwich and it was utter bliss, and everyone in my group (we were a party of 9) were served speedily and everyone was happy. END
BEGIN NOW  The next time I came, almost every person had a problem with their order (the wrong sides were brought out, goat cheese was missing from a goat cheese omelet). END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back again because this is a lovely place on lovely Lake Merritt, and I'll update this review to see if that day was a fluke or if it's a consistent thing. END
BEGIN NOW Regards, I'll be back because the service is great and the view is honestly worth it alone. END
BEGIN NOW As I predicted in my initial review, we didn't rush back here. END
BEGIN NOW   We returned for dinner and music tonight w/ Nina and Larry. END
BEGIN NOW   We found parking a few blocks away and arrived in time for our 6:30 reservations. END
BEGIN NOW   It was still light out and we had a lovely view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   One of the things that encouraged our return, beside the music, was knowing that Louis Le Gassic, formerly chef at Bay Wolf, had been appointed as their new Executive Chef. END
BEGIN NOW   We were excited to try the food. END
BEGIN NOW   The group, Juke Joint, started performing at 7:00 on the bandstand I had observed the last time we were there for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW We were brought menus and a plate of sliced bread w/ a ramekin of soft butter. END
BEGIN NOW   Nina, Larry and I all decided to have glasses of Malbec while Alan opted for a glass of Downtown Brown, which Larry shared. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered a cup of turnip and apple soup w/ a float of truffle oil on top. END
BEGIN NOW   Alan, Nina and I ordered rack of lamb, which came w/ white beans and garlic green beans and Larry ordered salmon. END
BEGIN NOW   Alan and I ordered a side of honey braised carrots. END
BEGIN NOW   The soup was smooth and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   The lamb was cooked medium rare and was topped w/ a tasty salsa verde, which was almost like chimichurri. END
BEGIN NOW   Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW   The carrots were good, as were the white and green beans. END
BEGIN NOW   The wine was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   For dessert Nina and I shared an Irish coffee crème brulée, which was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Alan had a fresh fruit plate. END
BEGIN NOW   He and Larry had coffee. END
BEGIN NOW   Service was smooth and just attentive enough. END
BEGIN NOW The music was marvelous. END
BEGIN NOW   Several couples got up to dance, which was fun to watch. END
BEGIN NOW   One in particular was sensational. END
BEGIN NOW   We really enjoyed it and would have stayed even longer than we did, but the band took a break and Larry was ready to go so we left. END
BEGIN NOW   According to the Terrace Room website they have live music Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and Sundays at 11:00 for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   They have quite an impressive lineup of folks scheduled to play and I can see us returning to hear more music w/ another enjoyable meal. END
BEGIN NOW Super delicious! My friend lives across the street and neither one of us had been here. END
BEGIN NOW  I had just finished the Nike Women's Half in SF so I rightfully needed to consume all the calories. END
BEGIN NOW We lucked out and scored a table immediately by the window. END
BEGIN NOW  Score. END
BEGIN NOW  I love a view. END
BEGIN NOW I fueled up with a cup of coffee ($4 - minus a star because I cannot understand why a cup of coffee is $4) and a water. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend ordered two eyes, with wheat toast, and mini waffles. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Jack London omelet (crab, arugula, hollandaise, and I had egg whites) with wheat toast, and home fries. END
BEGIN NOW  Mouth. END
BEGIN NOW  Watering. END
BEGIN NOW  I loved the little fruit garnish and was close to licking the plate before Jack came to take it away. END
BEGIN NOW Jack was my server. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice, hipster looking fellow who was attentive, funny, and prompt. END
BEGIN NOW So four stars! I'll be back with for sure. END
BEGIN NOW just won't be getting $4 coffee. END
BEGIN NOW Terribly rude, we walked in with a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW  As soon as we walked in we were rudely asked to wait with no explanation, the hostess didnt even ask our name or if we had a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW When we explained our reservation, she chirped back that we'd have two minutes to order. END
BEGIN NOW Then the chef and another hostess came out to add to their rudeness and certainly NOT make us feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW  We turned around and walked out. END
BEGIN NOW  Never coming again. END
BEGIN NOW So I don't normally write yelp reviews, but I had a uniquely awful experience at the Terrace Room last night (Wednesday 4/20). END
BEGIN NOW  I'll start from the beginning:. END
BEGIN NOW I was walking around Lake Merritt around 6pm and heard some amazing live music coming from this gorgeous glass room across the street. END
BEGIN NOW  Naturally, I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW  I find myself in the Terrace Room, which is incredibly beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW  I decide to sit at the bar because I was not in the mood for a formal dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  It was pretty busy but the bartender got to me in record time and whipped up a mean Old Fashioned (the classic old fashioned way with a sugar cube and muddler) and convinced me to order the nachos. END
BEGIN NOW  If this review was about the nachos alone, they'd be getting 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I'd had the foresight to snap a pic to post because they were a work of art. END
BEGIN NOW  The brisket was so tender and the cheese was definitely drool-inducing. END
BEGIN NOW  So let's just say I was in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Then, this tiny rude server starts complaining to her that she opened a bottle of wine for him that she shouldn't have. END
BEGIN NOW  (I really was not trying to pay attention but he was making a spectacle). END
BEGIN NOW  She immediately apologized, and gave him an unopened bottle and got back to making drinks for the large group of women at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Then, for whatever reason, he continued to harp on and on about the opened bottle of wine, which was very rude and unprofessional. END
BEGIN NOW  I was just trying to watch the bands on stage, but instead was so rudely distracted by this one-man show. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't know how the bartender kept her cool, I woulda lost it. END
BEGIN NOW  I also happened to make awkward eye contact with several other people sitting at the bar, sharing looks of discomfort/annoyance with the server's display, so I know I'm not just unusually observant. END
BEGIN NOW Thought he was done but oh no he comes back barking his orders at her. END
BEGIN NOW  What really got me was that when she'd rush to make the drinks, they'd then sit there for at least TEN minutes getting diluted/warm/shitty. END
BEGIN NOW  Honestly, I felt really bad for that woman. END
BEGIN NOW  just another example of men feeling the need to verbally abuse and dominate a young and talented girl. END
BEGIN NOW  I made it known to her that I respected and admired her hard work, and she just smiled and shrugged, as if it was no big deal. END
BEGIN NOW All in all I came to enjoy the music and food/drinks, but this tiny little man just kept ruining the ambience and experience. END
BEGIN NOW  It is beyond me how a manager and restaurant allows for such inappropriate behavior, let alone allow it to disrupt the experience of a patron. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks were great and the music wonderful, but it pains me too much to see that behavior, so I will not be coming back. END
BEGIN NOW Bottomless bloody Mary's and/or mimosas, what could be better?. END
BEGIN NOW Started off with a bloody Mary and told the waitress I would be switching to mimosas afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW  She forgot, no big so I had two bloody Mary's and then switched. END
BEGIN NOW I was going to get the chicken and waffles, but the waitress informed me that it was two wings and not breast as I had hoped so instead got the two egg breakfast with bacon and sausage. END
BEGIN NOW  They didn't skimp on the meat which was awesome and the English muffin was nicely toasted. END
BEGIN NOW They started us off with mini muffins and fresh jam that were a very nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW We sat by the window which provides an amazing view of the lake, overall great experience. END
BEGIN NOW Located in the same building in, or at least next door to, a senior living facility, the Terrace Room offers a gorgeous view of Lake Merritt from the west, which means that most of the time you won't be blinded by the sun like you would from the other side of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW The food offerings include all the usual dishes you'd expect of a mainstream Californian restaurant, with the dishes sticking more towards the familiar instead of the inventive. END
BEGIN NOW  Moreover, given the generally average quality of the dishes, the prices seem just a bit steep. END
BEGIN NOW Overall, the atmosphere here is rather quiet and sedate. END
BEGIN NOW  Adding to this is the fact that, lake view aside, the place feels like a country cottage. END
BEGIN NOW  Your best bet would probably be brunch, when you can enjoy a sunny view of the lake, and when other folks dining at the restaurant are also in sunny dispositions. END
BEGIN NOW They have TRIVIA every other monday night at 7:30!!! It's really fun. END
BEGIN NOW  The hosts are cool, the food is good, the drinks are fun (but kind of expensive). END
BEGIN NOW  The parking is easy then because its late on a monday. END
BEGIN NOW  I parked right against the lake, literally in front of the building. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're looking for a place in Oakland to play trivia - you've found it. END
BEGIN NOW  The questions range from anything about pop culture, history, oakland themed, etc. END
BEGIN NOW  It's hard, but not too hard. END
BEGIN NOW  6 people to a team. END
BEGIN NOW  The prizes are gift certificates to the Terrace room. END
BEGIN NOW  I had a blast when I went with my friends. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll definitely be going back!. END
BEGIN NOW Note: The entrace to the terrace room is through the hotel entrance. END
BEGIN NOW  ((I had trouble finding it the first time I went there)). END
BEGIN NOW Ok, first of all, one of the bartenders are not very nice. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is slow, and I'm not sure if it was the colour of my skin, or just lack of skill, but I didn't feel very welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW  The girl, Molly was nice, and I appreciated her interaction. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, it literally took 40 minutes on a not so busy night to get a grilled cheese sandwich (which I had tipped before getting it). END
BEGIN NOW  I was so offended and turned off of my interaction, and the way the bar tender treated my fiend and I, I did not eat my food. END
BEGIN NOW I also love how the bartender commented "you know no body cares" while I wrote this review, and yes this comment was directed at me. END
BEGIN NOW  HE WAS SO RUDE ! Won't recommend a place that doesn't care about their customers, just saying!. END
BEGIN NOW very nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  not the most crowded on a friday night but it was kind of nice not having to shove your way through everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW  seems like more of a started bar?. END
BEGIN NOW someone said that they have amazing whiskey sours in their review. END
BEGIN NOW  i was excited but disappointed that they served their whiskey sours in the -not with egg white- fashion. END
BEGIN NOW  nevertheless, it was still well made. END
BEGIN NOW  but again, just thought the drinks were reasonably priced and jsut good. END
BEGIN NOW Meet my favorite cocktail bar in Oakland! I last ended up here after being booted out of Fauna. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, Fauna, when will you do something about your absurdly early last call times? We decided to head down the street and continue the festivities for my birthday. END
BEGIN NOW After getting a nice happy birthday wish from the doorman, we headed inside to grab some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The cocktails here were, as usual, amazingly tasty and reasonably priced ($9 - $12). END
BEGIN NOW  If memory serves me correct, I stuck with my favorites: Bee's Knees and Stones Throw. END
BEGIN NOW  Hooray for ginger beer! And, hooray for cool bartenders too!. END
BEGIN NOW It was just after midnight on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW  Our group was able to secure a table, relax, and enjoy the rest of the night. END
BEGIN NOW Tip: This place is conveniently located nearby the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW Bonus Birthday Tip: There's a food stand about a block away with bacon-wrapped hot dogs! As if that wasn't enough, the woman running the stand is absolutely hilarious!. END
BEGIN NOW Dogwood is a solid bar in a happening stretch of town, right near the Fox Theatre where Telegraph branches off Broadway towards the north. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a good variety of tasty cocktails to choose from, and the bartenders are knowledgeable and and friendly enough to make anything you want. END
BEGIN NOW  What's more, there's a decent menu of munchies, like the totally delicious cubanito sandwich I tried. END
BEGIN NOW  While the interior might feel a bit dark as you walk in, you'll adjust quickly to the cozy yet retro-sleek ambience. END
BEGIN NOW Also, you have to give the owners credit for sticking it out here over the years. END
BEGIN NOW  Dogwood is located on such a busy street corner that drunk drivers have crashed into it twice, while rioters have also smashed the windows twice. END
BEGIN NOW  Nevertheless, the area is on the way up and  the owners have bounced back each time. END
BEGIN NOW  Judging by the healthy crowds this place gets, it looks like the community has embraced Dogwood as well. END
BEGIN NOW Came here before a show at the Fox Theater to grab a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW The bees knees was sweet and yummy. END
BEGIN NOW  It's dangerous because it really doesn't taste like alcohol at all. END
BEGIN NOW  The 2nd cocktail I had (and the name I completely forgot) was described by the bartender as an adult version of an orange julius, and she was spot on. END
BEGIN NOW  It was refreshing and the egg whites made it super rich and frothy. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried a sip of what the bf drank (stones throw and farmer's daughter) and they were all good!. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, we had to try the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  And the reviews aren't kidding when they say it's BOMB DOT COM. END
BEGIN NOW  Perfect to munch on with your drinks!! Buttery, cheesy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't busy when we went so we were able to find seats and service was quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW $5 for a delicious, buttery, perfectly pressed grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  The option to add sundried tomato, basil, and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  Little cornichons on the side. END
BEGIN NOW  Mustard (the good stuff, mind you, none of that French's yellow) provided without asking. END
BEGIN NOW  Dogwood literally served me my dream sandwich on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW  If that isn't culinary inception, I don't know what is. END
BEGIN NOW As for cocktails, they are creative, tasty, and strong. END
BEGIN NOW  I love the Brooklyn, and the Bees Knees is, well, the BEES KNEES. END
BEGIN NOW  It's true you may have to wait - Dogwood can be packed late at night, and usually have just one bartender during happy hours/early evening. END
BEGIN NOW  I hate waiting, but if I had to wait, there's nowhere I'd rather hang around than a converted apothecary/pharmacy where the smell of grilled cheese permeates every corner. END
BEGIN NOW I think the bar is ok. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been here many times so obviously it is good enough to come back to. END
BEGIN NOW   The reason for the two stars is that I've just experienced way better. END
BEGIN NOW   When I think about Dogwood, I think about a place that is just like any 'ol Mission hipster bar in the City but trying to not be that way because it is very "Oakland and proud" but, nonetheless, is just like a Mission hipster bar in the city. END
BEGIN NOW   The well drinks are watered down but the cocktails are good (and overpriced, just like any Mission hipster bar). END
BEGIN NOW  Except therein lies the problem, this is Oakland, not the City, so the bar would be better just being Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW I have found the bartenders to range from being very friendly to ratchet. END
BEGIN NOW  who would have thought?  Also, any bartender that doesn't know what is in a Cape Cod should not be working as a bartender (IMHO). END
BEGIN NOW I'm a fan of the grilled cheese and cheese/meat plates which I do like and appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm sure I'll be back to this bar at some point but this isn't really a place I care to go to on the regular. END
BEGIN NOW This place is ok if you don't mind paying those "new Oakland" prices and rub shoulders with the sf crowd, ooops, I mean new Oakland crowd that has taken over Downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW Service used to be pretty good but is now pretty bad, don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks were decent, a little slow on service. END
BEGIN NOW   A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW Would have given a better review if they had not doubled the tip i originally gave them. END
BEGIN NOW   Be careful with using your credit card here. END
BEGIN NOW Had a nice, low-key evening at Dogwood on a Monday night!. END
BEGIN NOW I came out to Oakland from SF to meet a friend, and loved that this place was a block away from the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and basil, and it was absolutely delicious!  I also enjoyed my ginger beer cocktail, as well as a glass of wine. END
BEGIN NOW The service was very friendly, though we did have to go up to the bar to place our orders. END
BEGIN NOW The place wasn't too loud or busy on a Monday night, which made it a great atmosphere for catching up with an old friend. END
BEGIN NOW The prices are reasonable too!. END
BEGIN NOW I have visited this place many times, but I can't find myself to give a review. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel the place is too pretentious, pricy, and unfriendly bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  The only redeeming quality of the place is the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention very cramp. END
BEGIN NOW I have since changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW  I like the expansion and the food window. END
BEGIN NOW  More room, feel more friendly, and It feel more accepting. END
BEGIN NOW  Though, I was a bit tipsy because it was birthday. END
BEGIN NOW  I may have to check back again to give another try. END
BEGIN NOW What I had: the bees knees, various grilled cheese sandwiches, pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW Visit date: January 13, 2015. END
BEGIN NOW First time? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Twas a fun evening at Dogwood. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the bees knees - it was a decent drink, sweet and sour. END
BEGIN NOW  What really stood out were the snacks! We had two kinds of grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  One had tomato jam and the other had tomato and basil. END
BEGIN NOW  Both were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  The bread had a crisp outside and soft inside. END
BEGIN NOW  The cheese was gooey and warm. END
BEGIN NOW  I have a special place in my tummy for tomato jam and Dogwood's was an A+. END
BEGIN NOW  The dijon dipping sauce added a nice touch, too. END
BEGIN NOW  So did the pickles. END
BEGIN NOW There are plenty of seats around and open space to stand around or dance. END
BEGIN NOW  Order your food at the bar and they'll bring it out to you. END
BEGIN NOW Another venue that endearingly screams "Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW " This a long, narrow joint that somehow manages to pack in lots of people at the bar and in seated areas along the wall, all while featuring a dance stage in the back. END
BEGIN NOW  The setting feels old-school, almost Art Deco-ish. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd is casual, friendly, and unpretentious, as is to be expected of Oakland, and there's a large menu of yummy cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  Despite the fact that it can get busy on weekends, waits at the bar are never too long, and you can fit yourself in, whether with groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW 've been to Three Fifty-Five twice in the last few years, and I enjoyed both visits. END
BEGIN NOW The bar is a narrow space off of 19th Street. END
BEGIN NOW  There's a proper bar, followed by some tables and a dance floor in back. END
BEGIN NOW The drink menu is good - and cheap! My wife and I both enjoyed two cocktails each on our most recent visit, and the price tag was around $8 or $9. END
BEGIN NOW Service was friendly and efficient, which is welcome given that crowds start streaming in after nine. END
BEGIN NOW I'd be back if I were looking for a more intimate bar in downtown Oakland (until it gets a little rowdier in the later hours). END
BEGIN NOW You know, considering how Bar Three Fifty Five wasn't even our intended destination, I'd say our experience here was a pleasant surprise. END
BEGIN NOW   Not that I ever thought the place would be bad. END
BEGIN NOW   Not when, moments after checking in on Yelp, fellow Yelper Vi T. END
BEGIN NOW  commented, "good choice". END
BEGIN NOW   Talk about a stamp of approval!. END
BEGIN NOW People have described the place as a nicer type of dive, and I guess I can kind of see that. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I'd say it's more like an old school bar (think Tosca Cafe in SF), what with its aged charm and decor (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW   There's still a bit of an Oakland vibe in the air though, and the small stage in back makes them pretty different in comparison, but that bar!  Love the look of it, as well as their slate of alcohol that fills their shelves and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW The cocktail menu is short and sweet (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW com/biz_photos/bar-…), and not very expensive at $8 a pop (no wonder they're so beloved!). END
BEGIN NOW   Everything sounded great, but, on my friend's recommendation, I opted for the STARDUST REMEDY (Pimm's, Calvados, Ginger, Lime, and Falernum). END
BEGIN NOW   The name may sound child friendly, but this cocktail is definitely mature. END
BEGIN NOW   Balanced flavors with a decent pour, refreshing with some bite, and well-crafted by a bartender/mixologist that knows her stuff (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW Since we arrived relatively early, snagging a table for the six of us was relatively easy, as was parking around the corner. END
BEGIN NOW   However, don't be surprised if the place gets packed to the gills as the night goes on. END
BEGIN NOW   As we were leaving, a steady stream of folks were filing in (it's just two blocks over from The Fox Theater). END
BEGIN NOW   Either way, Bar Three Fifty Five is worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW and one of my new favorite bars in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW Great cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW  Dark and intimate venue. END
BEGIN NOW good for a date spot if you're into it. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd is hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW  Younger professional crowd around happy hour, older 30s to 40s crowd later in the night. END
BEGIN NOW OMGGGGG the red hair bartender is the rudest person ever I have never been treated like THATTT!!!!!!!she was the RUDEST person ever!!!!!! I just asked for a tequila drink and just repplied with if u want I can make u a paloma as only option efortless cuz was 1 am. END
BEGIN NOW  I agreed she came with a poorly made "paloma" my peers tryed and said tasfted rotted as I thpughtttttt cuz was goss. END
BEGIN NOW  Gave it back telling her something was wrong I wanted a last word and OMG she started saying bad words and throw it in my face complaining. END
BEGIN NOW  Came back with a poorly made, of course. END
BEGIN NOW  "Last word" OMG WiTH ICE IN THE DRINKKKKKKKKK when this drink was served UP!!#!#!!!!! I work in the industry and I WOULDVE FIRED HER ASS IN THE SPOT. END
BEGIN NOW  Im a current customer and your are going to see my face often and return drinks if they are bad. END
BEGIN NOW  I dont know how you can call youself bartender. END
BEGIN NOW  Its not about knowledge or skills (missing on you, higly noticeable) you also need peolpe skills. END
BEGIN NOW My food was burned and waaaaaay too over priced for what it is, sorry I hate to leave bad comments, but this is the third time in a row I have terrible. END
BEGIN NOW food. END
BEGIN NOW I'm very surprised that I have not written a review for 355. END
BEGIN NOW  I was here last night and it had been, possibly, a year and a half since I was last here. END
BEGIN NOW  Had a written a review of this, I probably would have given this place three stars. END
BEGIN NOW The reason being, I never really cared too much for this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Every time I would come here in the past, it was because other people wanted to go here. END
BEGIN NOW  I just always thought they were trying WAY too hard with their cocktails and never wanted to come in here on my own accord. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday, the lovely Lorrayne suggested meeting here for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  I was for it and since it had been so long since I was last here, I decided to give it another chance. END
BEGIN NOW  To my surprise, the menu changed. END
BEGIN NOW  It actually made sense and didn't give me a headache trying to look through it. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried their 19th Street Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW  It was good. END
BEGIN NOW  After that, I had to try their Gin & Housemade Tonic. END
BEGIN NOW  I love gin and I love gin & tonics. END
BEGIN NOW  Theirs was so good, I had three of them. END
BEGIN NOW  Lorrayne ordered a Dark & Stormy, which is also another one of my favorite drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  She let me have a taste. END
BEGIN NOW  It was very delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  It seems like they top theirs off with egg white and Lorrayne also informed me that they also make their ginger beer in house. END
BEGIN NOW So I must give thanks to Lorrayne for actually making me interested in Bar 355. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back here, even if it's on my own. END
BEGIN NOW There are definitely hipsters here but not the annoying ones that think listening to their grandparents songs on a gramophone is cool. END
BEGIN NOW This place is the definition of great vibes! I love this place!. END
BEGIN NOW Make Westing brings out a diverse and social crowd. END
BEGIN NOW  The music is low but still vibrant, which creates a great setting to mingle without screaming. END
BEGIN NOW  Feel free to get into an intense and fun game of bocce ball! Even standing around and watching is entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW  My friends and I meet and network with many amazing people all the time! Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. END
BEGIN NOW Our go to drink is the FRENCH MUSE, a must have! It looks all cute and innocent, but it is slightly dangerous! 1 will have you in a chillin' mood, 2 tipsyyy, and 3 LIT!! You will feel like you have been drinking all night, which is pretty much drink goals! My limit is usually 3, I don't dare go past! I always have a great time here! Each element of Make Westing creates the perfect ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW This is definitely the spot to go for after work drinks, pre-games, or weekend hangouts! One of my favorite places in Oakland by far!. END
BEGIN NOW Hipster bar alert. END
BEGIN NOW Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW  For the most part, it has a comfortable, inviting environment. END
BEGIN NOW  The indoor bocce ball courts are a nice touch, but be prepared to wait a while until one opens up. END
BEGIN NOW  By the same token, don't take too long when you get a court!. END
BEGIN NOW I took off a star because an employee was super rude to me for no particular reason. END
BEGIN NOW  He was clearing glasses from the bocce court area and was walking back toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I was inadvertently blocking his pathway, but instead of asking me politely to step to the side, he said in a sarcastic, annoyed tone, "It would help if you moved. END
BEGIN NOW " Typically, that's not how you would want to treat your customers, but hey, they didn't ask me. END
BEGIN NOW Been here a few times for drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Cool hipster place in downtown Oakland, slow on Mondays and usually very busy Thursday-Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW They make really good gimlets and mojitos. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartenders are friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  They have appetizers as well but I cannot rate them on that since I just go there for drinks, however the habanero popcorn looked really yummy the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW Very chill place to mingle with the locals in the area, definitely a place you can wear tennis shoes or heels. END
BEGIN NOW  Recommend this place to anyone looking to go to watch the games or hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW Braised oxtail sando!!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW I was able to sample there Braised oxtail sandwich and let me say I will be back for more, not oily, not fatty, near perfection on a toasted bun. END
BEGIN NOW  The sandwich on a whole was a tad small, especially if you are sharing, but the meat was tender and flavorful, not to salty, more or less all around perfect on meat to bun proportion. END
BEGIN NOW I also sampled the bone marrow dish, no skimming on this dish, full heavy amount of bone marrow on the bone, like most places that offer this dish you are scraping the bone to get every last bit, here the marrow was heavy, oily, thick consistency, throw it on some toasted bread that is offered and it is delicious, you can dip the bread in the sauce found underneath the bone, ohh man sooo good,. END
BEGIN NOW I do recommend this place for the food, I did sample few beers, I would stay for there food that they offer. END
BEGIN NOW food **** oxtail sandwich is a plus, bone marrow also a plus. END
BEGIN NOW service **** no wait, walked up to the bar and ordered, received the food in 5 min. END
BEGIN NOW price $$. END
BEGIN NOW ambiance **** large venue, bochi ball not regulated size but folks compete here, allot of room to stretch your legs, better to go on a week night to avoid several crowds during the friday and saturday crowds. END
BEGIN NOW I will be back for more oxtail and bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW Love Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW  Located in what is now Uptown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing is serving up quality hand crafted cocktails from some of the most friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW  What I enjoy most at Make Westing is the cheese selection. END
BEGIN NOW  Cow , Sheep or goat. END
BEGIN NOW  I always go for the cow and each time I fall in love. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing is serving Brie at its peak temp and they got it right. END
BEGIN NOW Outdoor seating with views of the hustle and bustle of the city. END
BEGIN NOW  Old school tavern feel inside. END
BEGIN NOW  Indoor Bocce. END
BEGIN NOW  clean restrooms and comfortable seating. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing is definitely key for Oakland Nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW I've had each of their house cocoktails and they are amazing. END
BEGIN NOW I've visited this bar twice and both times I felt extremely uncomfortable and out of place. END
BEGIN NOW After finding a seat at the bar, I was ignored by all three bartenders for atleast 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  Eventually, I enthusiastically waved one of the bartenders down to get his attention. END
BEGIN NOW  When he finally acknowledged me, he seemed annoyed or bothered that I wanted to BUY a drink. END
BEGIN NOW This bar seems to cater to a very specific crowd, which baffles me in the ever so diverse Bay Area of CA. END
BEGIN NOW I never understand how customer service can be so bad and/or exclusive especially when they don't realize that they are offending patrons that are spending their money in these establishments. END
BEGIN NOW I likely will never return to this place as long as it is the Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW Interesting!. END
BEGIN NOW This place has a special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW  It is where I first met my husband and where he later proposed. END
BEGIN NOW I still haven't been able to persuade anyone to play bocce ball with me. END
BEGIN NOW  :(. END
BEGIN NOW Here are the perks. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're usually a designated driver this place is still a lot of fun. END
BEGIN NOW  There is bocce and spicy popcorn to be had. END
BEGIN NOW   There are friendly bartenders who don't stank face you for not consuming alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW  They are bright enough to realize they can sell or give you something non alcoholic and that they can sell even more drinks to your pals who are imbibing. END
BEGIN NOW   They know the score!!! :). END
BEGIN NOW After the office Christmas party I and a small handful of my coworkers still wanted to be out and about, so we made our way from The Lake Chalet over to Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW  We somehow managed to grab a table with seats for all five of us in the incredibly packed place, and after perusing the menu of house cocktails I decided on a Garden Gimlet (gin, cucumber, basil, and lime). END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a big drinker and have always had a hard time finding cocktails I like, but the Garden Gimlet was really refreshing and light. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW The bocce court was in full swing, the music was really good, and everyone seemed in good spirits. END
BEGIN NOW  It was loud but we could still have a conversation, and in general the atmosphere was really positive. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a cool place whether you're coming as a group or a couple, and I'd definitely like to come here again. END
BEGIN NOW This is one of the least approachable bars on Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW  I've eaten the food here, and ended up bloody from bones which were not removed from the meat. END
BEGIN NOW  I've also enjoyed myself here many times after work in previous years when it was comfortable, it's when they bring in the bouncers on weekend nights that you are asking to be treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW  I would AVOID this bar until they hire more appropriate staff. END
BEGIN NOW  I would always love to support local business, but this place is not safe. END
BEGIN NOW You'll notice the reviews are dropping on this place because its going down hill fast. END
BEGIN NOW  I would give it zero stars if I could after my recent visit. END
BEGIN NOW You never know who you'll see at this bar!. END
BEGIN NOW A group of friends met up here before the Allen Stone concert at The Fox Theatre, and low and behold, the man himself is hanging out at the bar with friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Super cool. END
BEGIN NOW It's a typical laid back, casual, hipster bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Good prices, lots of space, and and nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd come back here before a show next time, too!. END
BEGIN NOW The last three times I've been in Radio bar they've had this human body mutilation video on which is kind of disturbing, but you can ignore it by keeping your gaze ahead toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  What you can't ignore is the crazy loud music when it's cranked. END
BEGIN NOW  The latter is the only thing about this bar that I don't like, probably because I prefer to be able to hear what people are saying without having to scream WHAT? repeatedly only to give up and nod politely. END
BEGIN NOW Drinks are cheap and the bar is dark. END
BEGIN NOW  Stools are comfortable, and occasionally there are patrons inside who compliment your teeth!. END
BEGIN NOW perhaps other than the fact that it seems to attract a lot of. END
BEGIN NOW If you don't like Radio then you are likely:. END
BEGIN NOW a) a pretentious prick from the 'burbs or SF. END
BEGIN NOW b) a hipster douche canoe who got lost on their way to Make Westing (much respect for MW bartenders, their evening crowd just sucks). END
BEGIN NOW c) a whiny waste of space on this planet. END
BEGIN NOW d) not friends with me, thank god. END
BEGIN NOW Zhiva, Melissa, Marni and the rest of the Radio crew are some of the nicest, most real people you will meet in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW  If they don't like you, you are probably a jerk with attitude and they are hoping you leave so the rest of us don't have to deal with your dumb-shit vibe. END
BEGIN NOW That said, drinks are always strong and always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Music is constantly changing so don't complain if you don't like it. END
BEGIN NOW  If you don't like dark red-lit places, you should move along. END
BEGIN NOW If you can let your hair down with a bunch of nice people and don't want to get ripped off while you drink, this is your bar. END
BEGIN NOW Cool Divey spot. END
BEGIN NOW  Very chill vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  Not sure where they got the Asian decor inspiration from, but the red lights do set a decent tone. END
BEGIN NOW  Bartenders were nice, service was good. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely one of the nastiest bathrooms I've seen in my Day! Hah Kudos for that! Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW Meh. END
BEGIN NOW It's a cool place to hang out, have drinks and listen to the DJ spin, but the bathrooms are hideous and the place is kind of small. END
BEGIN NOW  Dancing is out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks are good and the people seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW  It's just ok in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW Although I was the only person of Asian descent in the crowd here when I showed up, Radio appears to pay homage to its location near Chinatown by offering an intimate atmosphere that's not only lit dimly by lights in large red paper lanterns, but also punctuated by screens playing kung fu movies. END
BEGIN NOW The atmosphere seems to be both loungey and dive bar-ish at the same time, while the overall vibe is friendly, approachable, and intimate. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll make a point of coming back and trying out some more of their drinks. END
BEGIN NOW My friends and I were checking around Oakland for a good nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW  Being as its not the city we stumbled across Radio. END
BEGIN NOW  We went on a Friday night and the moment we got in we fell in love with the vibe and music. END
BEGIN NOW  Even though its small (since its a dive bar)  they have a good selection of alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW If you're looking for drinks accompanied with good hip hop and the bay area hyphy vibe this is the place to go. END
BEGIN NOW The place is tiny and cute- a little tight with the crowd it brings in but the atmosphere is loud and exciting. END
BEGIN NOW  The music bumps loudly and the bartenders are lively. END
BEGIN NOW  I was here via route bar hopping on Halloween night. END
BEGIN NOW  I really enjoyed the extra lighting and accent of the lanterns on the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW The walls are lined with mirrors (which is a great idea for a small place), the bar expands most of the room, there is no dance floor but of course, no dance floor is no excuse not to shake your hips. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're lucky, you can find tables and seats in the back corner. END
BEGIN NOW This is someplace I would def come back to check out on a night that isn't Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW  Fun!!. END
BEGIN NOW This is a dark and divey bar with a pretty laid-back vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  It's narrow and sort of hard to move around much. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartender was cool and suggested a great cocktail for me when she found she didn't have all the ingredients for a Corpse Reviver #2. END
BEGIN NOW  My biggest complaint was the ladies room. END
BEGIN NOW  It was very tiny, not very clean, and the toilet was clogged. END
BEGIN NOW  I hope I would find it in better condition on my next visit. END
BEGIN NOW Damn so I really loved this bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I was going a couple times a week (more like every day around 4 after work). END
BEGIN NOW  Will not be returning unfortunately. END
BEGIN NOW   I have been there at times and had an awesome experience with different bar tenders. END
BEGIN NOW   The long haired dude who drives a sick bike! Amazing and sooper nice. END
BEGIN NOW   This past 3 or 4 times I have always gotten service from a little ass hole of a chick. END
BEGIN NOW   First she's a jerk, 2nd,never smiles, and third she just has an unkind persona. END
BEGIN NOW   Like she doesn't want you there. END
BEGIN NOW I go back at different times in hopes that she is NOT there but she is. END
BEGIN NOW On several occasions she has not only been rude to me but my girlfriend as well. END
BEGIN NOW   Instances of refusing water because she's closing her register, or telling me to ask some one else in the most Dickish way. END
BEGIN NOW Damn lady thanks to YOU you lost a loyal customer. END
BEGIN NOW   MAKE THAT TWO. END
BEGIN NOW I used to always catch a last drink here before hopping on BART, so of them many times, a one drink stint is all I've really lingered for. END
BEGIN NOW   And to tell ya the troof, that is all I can really muster in here. END
BEGIN NOW First, the place is thin and narrow, but long. END
BEGIN NOW   If you aren't lucky enough to get a seat at the bar (which is probable), then you have to plaster your back against the long wall. END
BEGIN NOW   And the space between the back of the stools and your face, is literally about 3 feet. END
BEGIN NOW   And in that 3 foot space is where the rest of the schleps will have to walk, back and forth in order to get to the rest rooms. END
BEGIN NOW And to add to the insult, if it is a warm night, say 70's-80's, it will be 10-20 degrees warmer inside because I'm not sure if they have AC. END
BEGIN NOW   When the place fills up, all that body heat just compounds the problem. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't know how the bartenders are able to work in that heat. END
BEGIN NOW   Like clothes sticking to your skin. END
BEGIN NOW heat. END
BEGIN NOW   Like, let's get outa here after this drink. END
BEGIN NOW heat. END
BEGIN NOW But outside of a few major logistical issues, this place is a dive in true form. END
BEGIN NOW   Decent cheap drinks, great music (must be from a shuffler cuz I didn't notice a juke) usually throwbacks of some sort. END
BEGIN NOW   Diverse crowd and quintessential dive bar lighting (red district red). END
BEGIN NOW   A drink here will evoke memories of intimate meetings of elaborate schemes of a devious nature. END
BEGIN NOW   But that's just me watching way too many Tarantino flicks. END
BEGIN NOW   Now if it can bring me there, then it can't be all bad, now can it?. END
BEGIN NOW *throws in extra star*. END
BEGIN NOW I want start this off by complimenting the bar itself I have always liked the environment and have felt invited to come in , I live in the area so I'm around the bar often. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm writing this review based on how I was treated twice upon trying to enter the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm 22 with a baby face so u get carded (no problem with that) , I don't like how I was treated by one of the female staff who was completely rude and disrespectful to me because I don't look my age after I gave multiple forms of ID ,credit cards I  even showed a medical record and birth certificate  I should have never have had to go that far. END
BEGIN NOW  After being turned away by the woman my second time trying to enter the bar the same woman told me that she would only serve me if the bar next door would serve me , so I literally went there and I was served without hesitation after being carded she walked into the bar and asked the bartender if he was going to serve me he replied yes. END
BEGIN NOW  Then she se said to me ok well I'm still not serving you ,your not worth it your not worth me losing my job at the bar so drink here. END
BEGIN NOW  I told her that I didn't want to go there and asked her why she was treating me that way and she replied because u look too young I don't care what your I'd says. END
BEGIN NOW I wish I had the name of the woman who was rude but unfortunately  I don't I feel the way she handled everything was wrong especially to turn a customer away to somewhere else just to come inside of that place where you do not work just  to turn them away is unprofessional and tacky. END
BEGIN NOW OTHER THAN THIS INCIDENT ID SAY FIVE STAR TO THE BAR AND IT'S CREATED  ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW Coolish dive bar, but ultimately just a dive bar with some very red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW   I look at the entrace to this bar every day, since I can see it from my work, but this was my first venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW The bartender was interesting and chatty, and the beer selection was OK. END
BEGIN NOW   The very red lighting I didn't care much for, but I guess that's its shtick. END
BEGIN NOW  Ultimtely though, to me, it's just another bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not sure it'd be my first choice for after work - I might go to the Tribune instead which has a better beer selection, and food. END
BEGIN NOW 5 stars for the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  They are strong and CHEAP. END
BEGIN NOW  $4 for a gin and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW  That's cheaper than a beer at most places!. END
BEGIN NOW I went on a Friday night and the music was an interesting mix of early 2000's R&B  and some stuffs that I had never heard before. END
BEGIN NOW  It was sort of hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW  It would start off with Shaggy "Wasn't Me" then would abruptly change to some tribal beat type deal. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe I'm ignorant to good music or not cultured. END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe cultured people enjoy the music more. END
BEGIN NOW  All I know is I'm most happy when old school Nelly is playing uninterrupted for the entire night but maybe that's just me. END
BEGIN NOW Plea to the manager: PLEASE stop letting people in when the place is saturated. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar is tiny. END
BEGIN NOW  By 11 pm it was nearly impossible to move yet I noticed the bouncer letting more and more people in. END
BEGIN NOW  We ended up leaving because it was so crowded and hot and not worth it :/. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I give the place the 4 stars because I like the laidback vibe, the cheap drinks, and the hip hop/R&B jams. END
BEGIN NOW A hipsterish establishment that's super, super dark. END
BEGIN NOW  So dark, in fact, that you'd half expect to see the Milky Way galaxy hovering overhead as if you were on a middle school stargazing trek somewhere super remote. END
BEGIN NOW But instead of worrying about zombies popping out of the forest like you did on those dark stargazing treks, you'll have to deal with, well, hipsters and other more borderline types, who for all you know could indeed be walking zombies after a drink or a joint or two. END
BEGIN NOW  The dim red lighting doesn't accentuate people's best features, and you never know if people are staring at you just because they're also having a hard time seeing, or if they really really are creepy. END
BEGIN NOW I appreciate that there are divey places like this in Oakland, but I also appreciate that there are many other places in Oakland to choose from that are more happening and more my style. END
BEGIN NOW I dig it here. END
BEGIN NOW  Cheap happy hour from 4-9pm, they have Manhattan (my kinda drink), Martini, Lemon drop and Margarita all for $5. END
BEGIN NOW  It's really dark when you first walk in but your eyes will adjust eventually and all you see is the red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW  There are pool tables all the way in the back but it's also where the smokers are which I'm not a fan of cigarette smoke so I stay away from there. END
BEGIN NOW  DJ plays music after 10 or something like that and there's a small dancefloor so it gets packed around that time. END
BEGIN NOW  Bartenders and security were pretty friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't like that the bathroom only has one stall and can get pretty nasty but hey, it's to be expected at any bars right! It's a good spot to go to after work to decompress or meet up with friends for a good night and parking is always easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, Bartender chick socializing with her friends with her back to me. END
BEGIN NOW  (For over 10 mins). END
BEGIN NOW You suck and you're not as cool as you think. END
BEGIN NOW  You saw us and went about hooking your friends up with free drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  You should be fired. END
BEGIN NOW As for the bar, loved the dingy vibe with the added hip hop. END
BEGIN NOW  Usually, dives like this play metal which is what I'm used to. END
BEGIN NOW Too bad they didn't know who I was. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't make it into the annual Autumn Lights Festival and were waiting in line in the cold with 1,000+ people. END
BEGIN NOW  We left and took a stroll on Lake Merrit and decided to continue the night in a better fashion. END
BEGIN NOW  We weren't sure what to expect and I didn't brush up on my Yelp reviews of this place, however, didn't think it was too bad of an idea. END
BEGIN NOW We walked in and the place is completely dark. END
BEGIN NOW  You can literally piss or barf in the corner somewhere of at the bar, and no one would even notice it. END
BEGIN NOW  The light bulbs were all red tinted, which made the whole place blood red. END
BEGIN NOW  It's def. END
BEGIN NOW  appropriate for it's name. END
BEGIN NOW and for Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW There was no music that night, unfortunately, because drinking and dancing is always a great pair. END
BEGIN NOW  The drinks were cheap, the bartender was friendly, and clientele was "freakish". END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe it was just the lighting. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is small in size, not sure where the dance floor would have taken place if there was a DJ playing that night. END
BEGIN NOW We grabbed drinks and headed to a closed off back side where pool and chain smoking took place. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd was decent, mostly groups of friends hanging out. END
BEGIN NOW  However, the tables were mostly covered in grossness and the seats weren't too clean either, but it's a dive bar- that's how they get the label right?. END
BEGIN NOW I can see this place as a good stop on a night of bar hopping, maybe to pre-game and have smokes indoors, but definitely not a place to just hang out at all night. END
BEGIN NOW Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW  Requested fun  dance music for the ladies completely crowded AROUND the deserted dance floor. END
BEGIN NOW  The DJ  took a full 15 MIN to transition to dance party tunes that filled the dance floor for half an hour. END
BEGIN NOW   Everyone was so happy! Then the dirge of indulgent "ni**a ni**a blessed pu*sy" - you can't make this up, music that cleared the floor. END
BEGIN NOW  When asked WTF I was told there was a 'formula' to get people to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Horrible club. END
BEGIN NOW  Terrible drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  If you want to dance, look elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW  The DJ is faaaaaaaar too into himself to keep the peeps happy to dance :(. END
BEGIN NOW Creepers creeping in a way too smokey room, and I'm a smoker. END
BEGIN NOW  Good music and good drinks though. END
BEGIN NOW Great "dive bar"! Wouldn't have known about this place if I wasn't brought here. END
BEGIN NOW  No sign on the outside so you wouldn't think to come in. END
BEGIN NOW   So dark inside. END
BEGIN NOW  There is a smoking lounge (did we go back in time??) But you can stay clear of that and just hang by the bar and the front area, no detection of any smoke so no problem! Drinks are affordable. END
BEGIN NOW  Music is a throwback, but overall a good place to start/end the night!. END
BEGIN NOW  I HATE LABELS. END
BEGIN NOW   I DON’T LIKE HAVING TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO LITTLE BOXES. END
BEGIN NOW   BUT IF YOU HAD TO LABEL ME, I GUESS YOU COULD CALL ME… REAL. END
BEGIN NOW  I WANT TO BE THE SAME AS ALL THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. END

BEGIN NOW  Do you have any cash?. END
BEGIN NOW  They only take cash. END
BEGIN NOW  I know, right?. END
BEGIN NOW  Totes. END
BEGIN NOW  he would be so much more attractive if he didn't post so many selfies. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm nowhere close to where I thought I'd be at this age. END
BEGIN NOW   What am I doing with my life?. END
BEGIN NOW  Dude, I got so turnt last night!. END
BEGIN NOW  This article doe. END
BEGIN NOW  That party was too turnt!. END
BEGIN NOW  It’s hella hot outside today. END
BEGIN NOW  Karen only wears oversized frockets and leggings. END
BEGIN NOW   She’s hella basic. END
BEGIN NOW  She threw shade at me in front of everyone and thought I wouldn’t realize. END
BEGIN NOW  This song is giving me life! YAS!. END
BEGIN NOW  I totally ship Piper and Alex! My all-time favorite ship is Ross and Rachel. END
BEGIN NOW  Those tacos were good AF. END
BEGIN NOW  Did you see his eyes? He was lit af. END
BEGIN NOW  You always have my back, fam. END
BEGIN NOW  let's do brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  best brunch spot in the city, you can't even get there on the bus. END
BEGIN NOW  i can't, i'm in an uber right now. END
BEGIN NOW  A truly tasty burger requires no secrets; use only fresh ingredients, prepare them to order, and serve it as promptly as possible. END
BEGIN NOW   This one was delivered as promised on a soft Firebrand bun with pungent Point Reyes bleu cheese and sweet caramelized onions. END
BEGIN NOW   I opted for mine to be grilled medium-rare and to be spared the mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW  The kitchen at GLK did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW   My goodness was this sandwich delicious! Augmented by perfectly seasoned French fries and an ice cold pint, I relished every bite while dining outside overlooking Lake Merritt, enjoying the company of my girlfriend and strangers that were seated close by who all felt as strongly about their selection of entrees as I did mine. END
BEGIN NOW  They told me that that a total remodeling of the place had just been completed three days ago. END
BEGIN NOW   So I guess I'll just have to come back to check that out at brunch someday soon. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm already looking forward to it already. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm torn because the food was inventive yet pedestrian in execution. END
BEGIN NOW  Eggs Bennie is my fave and go to brunch meal. END
BEGIN NOW   It's the yardstick of a good spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Again,  torn. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW  Innovative- check. END
BEGIN NOW   They replaced the English muffin with rye bread, presumably from Acme, and the fruit with an salad with a nice vinegarette. END
BEGIN NOW    Score!. END
BEGIN NOW  Execution- the eggs came out over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW   They should've never come out of the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   They have just re-opened after a major reno and people are swarming like bees. END
BEGIN NOW   I put this down to the kitchen getting used to the new flow. END
BEGIN NOW  Staff- totally saved their bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   Really. END
BEGIN NOW    The hostess is very gracious and adept at empathizing with customers. END
BEGIN NOW   It takes a special person to get people excited for an hour wait by sending them to the farmers market and making it convenient to check in. END
BEGIN NOW    I sat in essentially the serve area for the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    The bartender made it the best seat in the house. END
BEGIN NOW   She is very thorough and attentive in her job. END
BEGIN NOW   Her mimosa was delish. END
BEGIN NOW  Trouble is the crowd and a need to turn tables. END
BEGIN NOW   Brunch is supposed to be, or at least feel, leisurely. END
BEGIN NOW   It was fun but I can see myself relaxing there. END
BEGIN NOW  I absolutely love this spot. END
BEGIN NOW  I was looking for a good brunch place not in SF and found Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   The restaurant is pretty damn small but if you can ge. END
BEGIN NOW  t there at a good time, the wait isn't terrible. END
BEGIN NOW   It's also nice that the lake is right outside so you can just hang out if the weather permits. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend and I ordered the Savory French Toast and the Pork Belly Hash. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't rteally remember the hash, because the savory french toast was SO FREAKING GOOD. END
BEGIN NOW   The flavor combos here just worked so well. END
BEGIN NOW   So well, in fact, that I ate here a little over a year ago and I'm just now writing the review. END
BEGIN NOW  I was also recently introduced to chilaquiles, which I see is on the menu here, so I'm making it a goal to return sometime soon!. END
BEGIN NOW  No wait at dinner time. END
BEGIN NOW    Thoughtful food prepared with love and care. END
BEGIN NOW    Nice breeze on the patio and lovely alcoholic and nonalcoholic drink options. END
BEGIN NOW    I will be back for brunch to see if it can live up to the hype and long lines. END
BEGIN NOW  This is by far in my top three places to eat. END
BEGIN NOW    I've usually just picked up a sandwhich, but I went for breakfast and has just a full on delicious meal. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a little chilly, but they provided blankets, which actually made the experience a little more fun. END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee is just right. END
BEGIN NOW    I got the soft scrambled eggs and it was just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    My dad got the oyako egg salad open faced on rye and the eggs had such a different flavor and texture but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  I just love the flavors here. END
BEGIN NOW    The portions are perfect. END
BEGIN NOW    And I absolutely loved the staff. END
BEGIN NOW    Whatever they're doing just keep doing it. END
BEGIN NOW    Love this place. END
BEGIN NOW  30 minute wait for brunch on a Monday? Must be that good, eh it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW   Came here for my birthday with a few friends, and we all shared what we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD: I had the chilaquiles since it was highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW   Personally, I didn't like how soggy the chips were and the salsa lacked flavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Out of the two dishes my friends ordered, oyaka and savory French toast, the savory French toast stood out for its unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   There is actually no French toast involved, just toasted rye bread for the base, topped with arugula and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   The oyaka was an open faced egg salad sandwich topped with chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend liked it, and I thought it just okay. END
BEGIN NOW   But honesty, it's hard to mess up an egg salad. END
BEGIN NOW  DRINKS: We shared a pitcher of POG mimosas, which were perfect for the hot weather. END
BEGIN NOW  OVERALL: I might come back to try out other things on the menu, but will stay away from the chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  What a lovely spot. END
BEGIN NOW   My beau and I went here on our last day in California, and to check out the spot as the friend we visited is the manager. END
BEGIN NOW   Most of the seating is outside (until the expansion is completed) but it was a nice enough day so we plopped down and ordered. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the strawberry French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   My boo had the eggs Benedict with toast, a side of greens and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   Our meal was so amazing!! Some of the best eggs I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW   They were light and fluffy yet moist and cheesy without being over cooked. END
BEGIN NOW   The French toast was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Lightly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Fresh strawberries, whip cream and yummy maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW  It hasn't even been a month since our visit and I already miss the food. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're in the Oakland area, do your mouth a favor and swing by this spot. END
BEGIN NOW  4. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm falling more and more in love with Oakland each time I visit, especially this area around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   Such gorgeous views with hip things to do, like brunch! I randomly searched for brunch places around here, and Grand Lake Kitchen was first on the list. END
BEGIN NOW   My boyfriend and I put our names on the list, took a brief walk around Lake Merritt, then came back just in time for our names to be called. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated on the outdoor patio. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a warm Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect for brunch outside. END
BEGIN NOW   What a lively vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Much different from having brunch in San Francisco, I'd say. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the Pastrami Benedict which was served on rye bread. END
BEGIN NOW   so unique and tasty! Lots of cool things on the menu, whether brunch, lunch, or snacks. END
BEGIN NOW   My boyfriend got the Pork Belly Hash which did not look as appealing as the Pastrami Benedict but equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Inside the actual restaurant seems more narrow, but you get to see the chefs work their magic, which is pretty cool. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall it's definitely worth the trek to Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   They have an excellent selection of meats that you can't miss!. END
BEGIN NOW  Got here around 11 and didn't get seated until 11:45. END
BEGIN NOW   Be prepared for that wait!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is tiny! But the food is great and the Bellinis are pretty good too. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the savory French toast and would recommend adding the prosciutto as I went without and kind of felt it was lacking. END
BEGIN NOW   I did love that the savory French toast had arugella and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW   Yuuuuum! Plus poached eggs were cooked well. END
BEGIN NOW   One was slightly over done but didn't affect the dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW  Friend ordered the soft scramble and it looked. END
BEGIN NOW   basic but tasted pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW  Although a tiny spot along Lake Merritt, Grand Lake Kitchen is truly a gem! I stopped in for a late breakfast/brunch and I would highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW   Although it's tempting to sit inside at the counter and watch the chefs work their magic, the umbrellaed outdoor patio gives a beautiful (although a touch away) view of beautiful Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   Although we visited on a Monday late morning (note: they're closed all day Tuesdays!), there was a steady stream of people waiting for tables throughout our visit. END
BEGIN NOW  We started with a bottled rose lemonade (although it isn't made in house, I always order a Fentimans soda when available) and a hibiscus cleanse (more sour than I expected but different in a good way). END
BEGIN NOW   From there we ordered the dungeness crab appetizer, served on toasted bread with avocado and topped with fresh greens. END
BEGIN NOW   This was truly a spectacular dish, the crab was amazing and the flavors combined perfectly and were crisp and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect appetizer to split between two people. END
BEGIN NOW   For our main course we ordered the Italian sandwich, which they cut in the kitchen for us and served on two plates, a nice touch, with a pickled vegetable on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   The ACME bread that it was served on (as most of the sandwiches are served on) is spectacular, sandwiches delicious meats, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   You will not be disappointed with this pick from the menu!. END
BEGIN NOW  Grand Lake Kitchen is a restaurant that, if I lived in the area, I would return to over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and I've heard from others positive things about so many dishes. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a place where it'd be easy to explore the menu and always want to order something new. END
BEGIN NOW   They also sell a variety of specialty products in the restaurant, including Durham, NC made Big Spoon peanut butter (shout out to my home city!) One note: they don't accept American Express here. END
BEGIN NOW  This is my favorite brunch spot in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   You have to get there early though, there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   I think the wait is worth it! The front patio is great too, it's right across from lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   I love the pastrami eggs Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW   The pellinis are super good too! Even if it's cold out, sit on the front prior. END
BEGIN NOW   They will give you blankets to keep warm. END
BEGIN NOW  Cheers to Yelp again for helping me find a delicious brunch place. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf's favorite meal of the day is brunch so off we go searching for one when I found this place. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm assuming they're expanding since there's construction going on next door. END
BEGIN NOW   Great if they are!. END
BEGIN NOW  Seatings are limited but we went on a weekday so snagged a table right away. END
BEGIN NOW   Love their outdoor seating area that is across from Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   Great place for a full belly then cross the street to walk it off. END
BEGIN NOW  We order the Savory French Toast and Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW   Great house coffee. END
BEGIN NOW   Would have been nice if they came by to check on us and refill it without asking. END
BEGIN NOW  but waitress was a sweetheart so all good. END
BEGIN NOW  SFT was delicious! I failed to add on prosciutto and it was still rich with flavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Wouldn't think that of just toast, eggs, arugula and cheese but the combination with the herb oil and sauté wild mushrooms made it a worth-order dish!. END
BEGIN NOW  Now to the Chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW  I love Mexican food but can't bring myself to like it for breakfast/brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   It's my personal taste so don't take my word for it. END
BEGIN NOW   BF thought it was good but not exceptional. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe. END
BEGIN NOW  only maybe if they give you an option to add carne asada or al pastor. END
BEGIN NOW  now that would be my type of a brunch!. END
BEGIN NOW  Short and sweet:. END
BEGIN NOW  "Deli-style" old-school restaurant feel. END
BEGIN NOW   The food was everything I've heard about it being. END
BEGIN NOW   We had the savory French toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't be scared, homie. END
BEGIN NOW   It was unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been hearing about it for months. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything it was supposed to be. END
BEGIN NOW  Friendly, attentive service. END
BEGIN NOW  With a beautiful view situated right across Lake Merritt, this place is in a perfect spot to sit back on a Sunday morning and eat some delicious food. END
BEGIN NOW    It was a 20 minute wait and none of us minded when they handed us some mimosas and coffee so that we could sit in their outside patio soaking up some sun. END
BEGIN NOW    Lucky for us, the weather was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   Warm enough to take off our jackets and grey blankets draped on the chairs in case we got chilly. END
BEGIN NOW  Let's get to the most important part of this experience and talk about the food. END
BEGIN NOW     Because that's what we care about the most right?  Here you go folks, straight from the menu right to you. END
BEGIN NOW  *CRAB TOAST - DUNGENESS CRAB, AVOCADO, PICKLED CHERRY PEPPER VINAIGRETTE, SOURDOUGH 14. END
BEGIN NOW  00. END
BEGIN NOW    Yessss. END
BEGIN NOW   Generous portion of crab meat, salad greens and perfectly toasted sourdough. END
BEGIN NOW    Couldn't get enough of this stuff. END
BEGIN NOW    It was so good that had they given us a bigger portion, I would have kept stuffing my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW    Not cute. END
BEGIN NOW  *CHILAQUILES - TORTILLA CHIPS, SALSA ROJA, BLACK BEANS, 2 EGGS SUNNY, AVOCADO, QUESO FRESCO, SOUR CREAM, PICKLED RED ONIONS 12. END
BEGIN NOW  00  I'm going to be in the minority and say that I wasn't impressed with this. END
BEGIN NOW    The red sauce was bland and nothing about this stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW    Wouldn't order it again. END
BEGIN NOW  *SAVORY FRENCH TOAST - RYE BREAD IN PORCINI BATTER, 2 POACHED EGGS, WILD MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, ARUGULA, HERB OIL 13. END
BEGIN NOW  00  Savory French Toast?  Talk about first time for everything. END
BEGIN NOW    I was glad I got to pop this cherry because boy oh boy. END
BEGIN NOW    This was good. END
BEGIN NOW    The french toast itself was slightly crunchy on the outside, seasoned with a pinch of salt. END
BEGIN NOW   The rest of the ingredients were the perfect accompaniment. END
BEGIN NOW    Pancetta on top gave it a nice salty kick and we practically inhaled this entire plate. END
BEGIN NOW  I have to add in that their bathroom was immaculate. END
BEGIN NOW    If you've read my other reviews, you know how much I appreciate a clean toilet bowl. END
BEGIN NOW    Good job Grand Lake Kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW    You have impressed me. END
BEGIN NOW  perfect for wkend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are the best. END
BEGIN NOW    we always come here for these. END
BEGIN NOW  we've tried some benedicts. END
BEGIN NOW  and it was good too but Pork belly hash & sourdough French toast are something really special about this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW  all servers are super nice!!! Thank that I can start my wkend morning pleasantly w these great food and awesome servers. END
BEGIN NOW  THEY ARE BACK AND THEY BETTA!. END
BEGIN NOW  Bigger inside more seating with a bar! Same amazing customer service and delicious food! Love this place so much I always leave happy and stuffed. END
BEGIN NOW  People who have read my reviews know that breakfast/brunch is my least favorite meal to eat out. END
BEGIN NOW   Mainly because I'm always underwhelmed. END
BEGIN NOW   I've yet to find an amazing brunch in East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW  Grand Lake Kitchen has been on my list to try though due to the great reviews and alluring photos. END
BEGIN NOW   Since me and the BF were free on a Thursday morning, I decided to give it a try!. END
BEGIN NOW  There was no wait, but we decided to sit outside since it was nice and cool. END
BEGIN NOW   They gave us blankets to keep warm, which I thought was a nice touch!. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the chilaquiles and the savory french toast. END
BEGIN NOW   It was my first time having chilaquiles and I wasn't that impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Soggy chips, coquita cheese and unseasoned black beans. END
BEGIN NOW   The scrambled eggs were soft but lackluster on their own. END
BEGIN NOW    Ample amount of avocado! I felt like everything was on the bland side and I needed to use salt on everything (which I usually never do). END
BEGIN NOW   The savory french toast was interesting and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the mushrooms! But I found the huge amount of arugula to be a bit much. END
BEGIN NOW   Portions were decent size. END
BEGIN NOW   However, it wasn't a WOW dish for me either. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall, I found both dishes to be just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was really friendly and attentive though, checking up on use to make sure we were good since we were the only ones sitting outside. END
BEGIN NOW  The search continues. END
BEGIN NOW  Extremely cute brunch & lunch place in Oakland near Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW   This spot is kind of small and crammed, but the food is fresh and not too greasy. END
BEGIN NOW   My partner and I split the breakfast sandwich and ordered a side salad with roasted chicken. END
BEGIN NOW   The breakfast sandwich was delicious and I especially loved the acme bread it was on. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread was soft and not too hard and it blended well with the eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   We decided to substitute the ham for bacon at a $1 extra as I am not a fan of ham. END
BEGIN NOW   The salad was pretty good too and the dressing had a mustard vinaigrette dressing. END
BEGIN NOW  I was a little disappointed because I wanted to try the pork belly hash which is only served on the weekends so I will definitely need to be back when I'm in the Bay Area again. END
BEGIN NOW   They also sell chips, spreads, bread and some other groceries on a shelf near the entrance. END
BEGIN NOW  Grand Lake Kitchen is/was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I have no complaints about the food or the service. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I don't think it warrants the rating it has on here. END
BEGIN NOW  I had one of their recommended sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good, but it was nothing to write home about. END
BEGIN NOW   If you decide to eat here, the portions can be small, so you may have to order side dishes. END
BEGIN NOW  There are a couple of things I have on repeat at this joint. END
BEGIN NOW  Because they don't have a ton of veggie options. END
BEGIN NOW  French toast with oven-toasted blackberries? Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW  Huevos rancheros? Good but not Mexican enough (calm down, I'm Mexican, so I have license to say that). END
BEGIN NOW  Red potato salad? Good. END
BEGIN NOW  Obama sammie? Great:). END
BEGIN NOW  Usually love brunching at Oakland Grill around the corner; in fact it's my fave spot in Oakland to brunch hands down but decided to try something different so we tried out Chop Bar instead. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered the pork belly hash, it was absolutely delish, hats off to the chefs. END
BEGIN NOW   Also ordered mimosas, it was meh. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend wasnt impressed with this place however the ambience more then made up for it. END
BEGIN NOW   The interior had a beautiful layout woodsy country theme with a modern twist. END
BEGIN NOW   Decided to try the outdoor sitting, just perfect for a summer day. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice cool breeze and the opportunity to people watch :). END
BEGIN NOW  2 stars for the servers, they were not friendly, lacked enthusiasm but I didn't let that ruin my vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Check out this spot when you're in the area!. END
BEGIN NOW  Decent place for weekend brunch in a casual, relaxed setting. END
BEGIN NOW  I opted for the eggs Benedict, which was pretty good - the Hollandaise sauce was nice and smooth and the eggs were cooked perfectly, although the English muffin was a bit tough. END
BEGIN NOW   I also enjoyed the Bloody Mary with bacon, which had a good combination of saltiness and spice. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is not the most engaging, but adequate for the prices. END
BEGIN NOW  Friendly service, chic-industrial interior, so-so brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW  The pork belly hash left something to be desired. END
BEGIN NOW   so says mi amigo. END
BEGIN NOW  And the Eggs ala Cazuela with Veggie Mojo? Well, first let me translate that for non espanol speakers- eggs baked in roasted tomato-pepper sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Now for my review of that dish. END
BEGIN NOW   En espanol- Es ok. END
BEGIN NOW   In English- It's okay. END
BEGIN NOW  Two eggs swimming in tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   Soak up the sun (of sauce) with roasted potatoes and 2 small slices of acme bread. END
BEGIN NOW   I feel a side salad or some greenery would've spruced things up- evened out that sauce, carbs, and eggs dynamic. END
BEGIN NOW   Hello, Salt. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW  The laid-back vibe and open window seating creates an enjoyable atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   Close to Jack London square (not near the water but in the warehouse area), Chop Bar is a 10 minute walk from the Lake Merritt bart stop. END
BEGIN NOW   I hear their oxtail poutine fries are good, so I'd get that if I came another time. END
BEGIN NOW   Seems like a fun place for a happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been here twice and I have yet to eat anything that I would reorder. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks, however, are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The bacon bloody Mary is tangy, spicy, sweet and robust. END
BEGIN NOW   Do yourself a favor and get a group together for brunch and order the Bacon Bloody Mary. END
BEGIN NOW   Your taste buds will appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW  isited on Valentine's Day!. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't too busy yet since we came early. END
BEGIN NOW   Food was aiiittteee. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the polenta and mimosa. END
BEGIN NOW   Mimosa was good. END
BEGIN NOW   Polenta was fine. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a cute place f'sho. END
BEGIN NOW  The cute table gave my sweater dress a splinter. END
BEGIN NOW   Good thing it didn't puncture through my dress. END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing else on the menu stood out to me so I probably won't be back. END
BEGIN NOW  It'a located in good ol' Jack London square. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice location good for dates. END
BEGIN NOW   Walk around and catch the farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW   Or catch whatever is going on at Jack London square! They have Jack of all trades. END
BEGIN NOW   Movies in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW   The list goes on. END
BEGIN NOW  Great food at reasonable prices. END
BEGIN NOW   Taken out of town guests here twice and everyone has commented on the excellent quality of the food. END
BEGIN NOW  Food - fantastic! I've tried or sampled: pork banh mi, mussels, chicken torta, the chop burger, Ruben, and fish tacos. END
BEGIN NOW   All were flawless and would order each item again. END
BEGIN NOW   I would give special attention to the broth with the mussels and ask for extra bread; you don't want to let that broth go to waste. END
BEGIN NOW  Drinks- again fantastic! I've tried the Bloody Mary with and without Bacon - highly recommend either as they tickle all different flavor areas on your tongue. END
BEGIN NOW    Also had a Spicy Q, drink with rum and jalapeño, would order on the rocks next time but delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  Service - first visit was absolutely amazing - server was a mind reader - on it for drink orders and brought extra bread for the mussels without us even asking. END
BEGIN NOW    I tipped 30% in appreciation. END
BEGIN NOW  Second visit was sub-par. END
BEGIN NOW   I just felt like the server didn't want to be there and didn't ask if we wanted a second round of drinks when we were low. END
BEGIN NOW   Ended up not ordering more drinks because we finished our food. END
BEGIN NOW   Also asked how was the food while facing another table and not making eye contact. END
BEGIN NOW   Head wasn't in the game. END
BEGIN NOW   Essentially barely checking on us after the food came out. END
BEGIN NOW   I was server for 4 years, we all have those off days (or hangovers), I get it. END
BEGIN NOW  Atmosphere - really love the bar and wood elements inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Pig pictures on the walls and pig toilet paper holder in bathroom is a funny touch. END
BEGIN NOW   Saw a TV but it was not on during lunch hours for either visit. END
BEGIN NOW  not sure if that was intentional or not but it created more of a conversational experience at my table with dudes who would have normally zoned out to sportscenter. END
BEGIN NOW   Didn't bother me either way, just felt it should be noted. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall - 4 Stars - would give them a 5 except for service on second visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect ratings are reserved for perfect restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW  Pastrami Potato Hash was well seasoned, poached eggs were done perfectly and the potatoes were solid. END
BEGIN NOW  The frittata was a unique twist on the classic. END
BEGIN NOW   There's was thinner with a crispy bottom vs traditional ones that is thicker and more reminiscent of a pie. END
BEGIN NOW  The variety is good but not the best for vegetarians especially during brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Expect to wait especially during peak times. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall Thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW  I am glad I got a chance to try Chop Bar and more grateful that I didn't leave disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  Not going to lie, one of the best parts of Chop Bar is that you can call 30 min in advance and put your name down for a table. END
BEGIN NOW   I was on Bart when I called and upon arrival a table was waiting for us! A few other groups were waiting outside for brunch but we just sat right down. END
BEGIN NOW   (if only SF places were like this. END
BEGIN NOW  ). END
BEGIN NOW  Walking up, we saw some people with the bloody marys and they looked incredible! I personally don't like bloody marys but my friend said it wasn't quite as spicy as she would have liked. END
BEGIN NOW   The pickled veggies and the bacon that come with it were delicious though!. END
BEGIN NOW  I got the french toast with apples and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW   The toast was pretty fluffy and thoroughly soaked in syrup. END
BEGIN NOW   In fact, the toast was in a pool of syrup so the last few bites were a bit too soggy. END
BEGIN NOW   I also wished there had been more apples and walnuts because that would have added more texture to the dish. END
BEGIN NOW  Chop Bar is a great spot for brunch and lunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch: 4 stars, Lunch: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Dinner: 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  Although the brunch menu may look like your typical brunch, they really do a great job. END
BEGIN NOW   The quality of ingredients and the flavors are on point. END
BEGIN NOW   The chilaquiles and french toast are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Lunch is also good too but the few times I've been I wasn't too impressed with their menu. END
BEGIN NOW   One item I really enjoyed was their clams. END
BEGIN NOW   My mom had the pork banh-mi and I wasn't too impressed when I tried it. END
BEGIN NOW   It was expensive and made with great quality ingredients I'm sure, but it didn't beat a $4 banh mi I could get in chinatown. END
BEGIN NOW   I also tried the oxtail poutine which was a little too saucy and it needed either more fries or bread on the side to dip into it. END
BEGIN NOW   Delicious but I couldn't just slurp the gravy on its own. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all, the service is great and there is a great amount of parking near by. END
BEGIN NOW   The ambiance is nice with indoor and outdoor seating. END
BEGIN NOW   The last time I went Festus Ezeli from the warriors was sitting near me. END
BEGIN NOW   I was pretty star struck and decided not to disturb him, but that was a cool memory of this place! (:. END
BEGIN NOW  Wanted to try the Bloody Mary ($8) at this place since I heard it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I had never had one before, so I figured I might as well start with a good one. END
BEGIN NOW   Needless to say, I don't think I'm the Bloody Mary type. END
BEGIN NOW   It had a nice flavor, but it's too spicy and more like a meal in a glass (I'm also not a fan of milkshakes with my food). END
BEGIN NOW   I do recommend getting it with bacon ($2 extra), as it's some of the best I've had. END
BEGIN NOW  The food came to us oddly quick. END
BEGIN NOW   Within minutes. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the asparagus appetizer ($11). END
BEGIN NOW   It came with a poached egg and some sort of green sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   Flavor was nice, but it was a little salty. END
BEGIN NOW   Not too salty, just a little. END
BEGIN NOW  I got the Chop Bar Burger for my meal ($14) with Swiss cheese ($1 extra, but some add-ons were $2 extra). END
BEGIN NOW   Meat-wise, the burger was top notch. END
BEGIN NOW   And I liked the bun, too. END
BEGIN NOW   Other than that, there weren't a whole lot of other flavors going on. END
BEGIN NOW   Just the bacon, which merely added to the saltiness of the patty. END
BEGIN NOW   The Swiss cheese and the aioli were non-existent. END
BEGIN NOW   I even asked for more aioli for extra taste. END
BEGIN NOW   It only barely helped. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't a bad burger by any means. END
BEGIN NOW   It was just too reliant on the bold meat flavor and needed a little more craft. END
BEGIN NOW  My dad got the pork confit ($20) with a side of Jo-Jos ($6), which are basically potato wedges. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork was very flavorful, and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  They specialize in meat, and they passed with flying colors in that department. END
BEGIN NOW   It's just that they tend to add a lot of ingredients that merely sound good on paper without truly complimenting each other. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, this place is a tad bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW   $8 for the Bloody Mary isn't bad, but the food is just too expensive for the quality. END
BEGIN NOW   I've had better for less. END
BEGIN NOW  But most importantly, this place was good enough to make me want to come back to try their other menu items. END
BEGIN NOW  We heard the meatloaf was good, but I guess we'll save that for next time. END
BEGIN NOW  Try ordering ANYTHING off the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   These guys have ZERO interest in giving a customer a satisfying experience. END
BEGIN NOW   I feel bad because the chefs are working hard trying to make amazing food and it's being served by these indifferent "hipster barrista" types. END
BEGIN NOW  Damn disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  Sunday brunch was most excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   We were seated fairly quickly. END
BEGIN NOW   The staff was incredibly attentive and nice. END
BEGIN NOW   All smiles!. END
BEGIN NOW  The French toast is a big win. END
BEGIN NOW   Custard-dipped brioche with candied walnuts, apples and whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW   It was to die for. END
BEGIN NOW  Other big wins was the chiliquiles with chorizo and salsa verde. END
BEGIN NOW   A really big portion. END
BEGIN NOW  The side of bacon was meh. END
BEGIN NOW   It was actually one slice of bacon cut in three chunks. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't particularly tasty and $5 which was a bit of a rip off. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee was most excellent and local. END
BEGIN NOW  Will definitely visit this place again. END
BEGIN NOW  I love that this place lets you call ahead for brunch to put your name down on the list. END
BEGIN NOW   I cannot appreciate that enough. END
BEGIN NOW   I oftentimes will avoid brunch in SF because I don't want to wait over an hour after I get there just to get seated. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried the bloody mary "baconized". END
BEGIN NOW   I saw other people with the bloody mary as we walked in and decided right then that I had to get it. END
BEGIN NOW   It looked like a pretty standard bloody mary, but with bacon on top (I know, right?!)!! Not sure how much I actually liked the bacon in it, but it was definitely an interesting twist. END
BEGIN NOW   The bloody mary itself was decent, a little on the tomato-y side, not super spicy. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu is not super extensive, but has your standard brunch options. END
BEGIN NOW   Between me and my friends, we ordered a few different things. END
BEGIN NOW  1) Pastrami hash (with poached eggs) - I had this, it was pretty tasty, nothing particularly special about it, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I enjoyed it, though it was more like chunks of pastrami and potato, rather than a hash really. END
BEGIN NOW  2) Pork belly frittata - The pork belly in the frittata looked like it had a good fat to lean ratio (which is important!) but wasn't seasoned quite enough. END
BEGIN NOW  3) Eggs cazuela. END
BEGIN NOW  4) French toast. END
BEGIN NOW  Chop Bar is the good Oakland, the kind you want to show off to your friends. END
BEGIN NOW  It's located in a cool loft space in Jack London, within walking distance from the Blue Bottle flagship location. END
BEGIN NOW   The wait on a Sunday afternoon teeters around 20 mins, which isn't all that bad in comparison to some spots in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu features all kinds of new American and California inspired plates. END
BEGIN NOW   Their burger is a serious force to be reckoned with. END
BEGIN NOW   This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW   Let me lay this out for you. END
BEGIN NOW   the bun is somewhere between sourdough and a pastry. END
BEGIN NOW   It is remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW   The hamburger patty is so thick and so juicy and as you eat this thing, the juices dribble out and the soft part of the bun soaks it up. END
BEGIN NOW   Thick, hickory smoked slices of bacon and avocado adorn this creation. END
BEGIN NOW   Make sure to add cheese too because, holy crap, the melted swiss cheese on this thing was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   I asked for medium rare and received a very well done patty, but I was too hungry to do anything about it. END
BEGIN NOW   Kind of a bummer, so make sure your waiter knows you're not playing around. END
BEGIN NOW  They only have 4 beers on tap, none of which is a pilsner, and all their taps were broken when I went. END
BEGIN NOW   Basically their only downfall is being a beer buzzkill. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel like Chop Bar can do no wrong. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had dinner here twice, and stopped in one time for lunch. END
BEGIN NOW    While it can get kind of loud in this small, intimate space, you'll probably be too busy savoring the amazing food to want to talk to whoever else you're with. END
BEGIN NOW    Just keeping it 100. END
BEGIN NOW  Their agua frescas ($3) are, well, refreshing. END
BEGIN NOW    If you want something other than water, but that won't drive your BAC up, this is a great choice. END
BEGIN NOW    I had a watermelon one for dinner and it had the faintest hint of lime in it, too. END
BEGIN NOW    Even with the striking blend of flavors, I think it blended pretty well with the pork chop I ordered that evening. END
BEGIN NOW  For lunch, I opted for their pork Bolognese with pac mac noodles by Baia Pasta (shop. END
BEGIN NOW  baiapasta. END
BEGIN NOW  com/produ…) - $18. END
BEGIN NOW    If you're not in the mood for meat, there's also a seasonal vegetable option, too. END
BEGIN NOW    With a generous portion of shaved parmesan on top, this dish really hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW    Just the right ratio of noodles to sauce, with plenty of chunks of savory ground pork. END
BEGIN NOW  The first time I had dinner here, I went for the oxtail poutine - $20 (french fries, oxtail gravy, Fiscalini cheddar). END
BEGIN NOW    I might or might not have licked the plate clean. END
BEGIN NOW  The second time I went for dinner, I ordered the pork chop and chose kale and mashed potatoes as my side dishes (you also have the option of going with their mac and cheese) - $24. END
BEGIN NOW    Their mashed potatoes were just too good. END
BEGIN NOW    I honestly want to ask them to double up on the mashed potatoes next time. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe i'll just beg for a bowl as my entree. END
BEGIN NOW    The kale was cooked perfectly with onions and garlic, too, and I definitely felt less guilty eating them. END
BEGIN NOW   but the mashed potatoes!!!  As for the pork chop, goodness. END
BEGIN NOW    There was a slight crust that formed all around while the interior remained tender and moist. END
BEGIN NOW    It came in a pool of gravy that complimented it nicely, too, not salty or gelatinous as some gravies can be. END
BEGIN NOW  I would definitely be proud to show this gem of a gastropub to friends and family. END
BEGIN NOW    Maybe next time I'll try some appetizers and desserts, too. END
BEGIN NOW  We came here for brunch on Mother's Day , we called about 30 mins ahead and was seated almost right away. END
BEGIN NOW   The food arrived quickly and the server was great. END
BEGIN NOW   We got the pork hash , the eggs Benedict and eggs Benedict with crab and the torta. END
BEGIN NOW   All the food was perfect and cooked wonderfully. END
BEGIN NOW   The torta was almost like a banh mi fusion but I'm not complaining , I probably wouldn't call it a torta but it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   The crab eggs Benedict tasted amazing , they were really generous with the crab and came with a generous side of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Of course I can't forget about the hot sauce , they had cholula and a house made sauce that was really smokey and delicious but pretty spicy. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't wait to come back again. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is eehhhh. END
BEGIN NOW   The price we paid was definitely not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW   2 entrees and a coffee and orange juice cost us about $40! The French toast was so soggy. END
BEGIN NOW   My husband ordered the pork belly hash. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't even pork belly more like small tiny pieces of bacon and there's no hash! It was just home style potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Not worth it. END
BEGIN NOW   Go over by lake Merritt for way better brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW  come to Portal's Queer Beer Wednesday every week! The sliders on the happy hour menu are my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW  UPDATE: I have been coming to every QBW for over a year! The fried chicken sliders are a welcome addition to the before 5:00 "happy (hour) meal" menu, and I'm not sorry to see the cheese sauce go from the fries either. END
BEGIN NOW   Portal's rotating menu of craft beers has taught me a lot about beer and about my taste too. END
BEGIN NOW   Ask for Melvin. END
BEGIN NOW   He's the best!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is pretty neat. END
BEGIN NOW   I came in for lunch on a beautiful afternoon and sat on the outdoor patio overlooking the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a large party of 12 requiring the attn of most of the wait staff (3 servers). END
BEGIN NOW   Service was very slow from start to finish. END
BEGIN NOW   Not a place for a quick bite or lunch if you're on the clock. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was very good. END
BEGIN NOW   Quality ingredients and large portions. END
BEGIN NOW   I went with the Garlic bread meatball sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW   The mini burgers and chilaquiles looked good and I hope to come back for those. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall a good spot, but service was shoddy -- no refills or checkups. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for dinner with a few friends. END
BEGIN NOW    We shared the vegetarian garbage bread, which was quite delish. END
BEGIN NOW    The garbage bread was very hearty, and it definitely did not need meat. END
BEGIN NOW    Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW    For myself, I ordered 2 mini burgers in fried chicken and turkey, both were quite filling and tasty, though not as exciting as our garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall the atmosphere was a nice small pub, great for a couple of friends. END
BEGIN NOW    The outside area is also very cute, definitely want to return for brunch with mimosas!  Will update my review upon return!. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm completely in love with this place. END
BEGIN NOW   The food, the people, the beer, and seating!! Very close to the lake with outdoor seating (there's indoor seating as well). END
BEGIN NOW   They have 3 tvs inside, and one shared bathroom (the only drawback). END
BEGIN NOW  I love the beer selection here, only problem I have is that there's a high turn over of the beer. END
BEGIN NOW   As soon as you fall in love with one there's one to replace it. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is great, try the cheese knots. END
BEGIN NOW   They're basically like homemade mozzarella sticks and they will change your life on how you see mozzarella sticks. END
BEGIN NOW   The wings are great as well. END
BEGIN NOW   Not bad prices. END
BEGIN NOW  There's parking all around. END
BEGIN NOW   When you sit outside you have views of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   Very nice decor both indoor and outdoor. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW   They do have vegan and veg options!. END
BEGIN NOW  It is definitely worth the (honestly not bad) wait for a table on the patio. END
BEGIN NOW   I was so relaxed with a beer and good food, staring out at the breezy lake. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank God out of their decently-sized list of beers on tap, there was at least one sour. END
BEGIN NOW   We just barely missed bottomless mimosas (I believe they're done at 1 pm?), damn. END
BEGIN NOW  We shared the pork belly salad and garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW   If it sounds like we were eating light, we absolutely were not. END
BEGIN NOW   The garbage bread sneaks up on you, and all the fixings inside are going to make you groan after it settles in twenty or so minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   Delicious in the moment, though. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork belly salad was average, and a bit overdressed/salty. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking was fortunately easy to find all around, and seriously, thank God for the location. END
BEGIN NOW   We had to walk it off for an hour around the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal is like. END
BEGIN NOW  one of those places where you stumble across on accident. END
BEGIN NOW   But at the end of the day you realize the encounter was supposed to happen. END
BEGIN NOW   Some may even say "divine intervention" well at least for those into bar food with a light sophisticated twist. END
BEGIN NOW   And those that like local beers, hoppy ales, and micro brews. END
BEGIN NOW   And a nice view of Lake Merrit from the patio. END
BEGIN NOW   So far Portal has a few things right. END
BEGIN NOW   Allow me to tell you a little more. END
BEGIN NOW   Here is my review of Portal. END
BEGIN NOW  4/21/16. END
BEGIN NOW  My constant Yelping seems to have rubbed on aome of my friends! I decided to stay and take in Oakland after going to my guard card class earlier on in the day. END
BEGIN NOW   I had booked marked so many places in Oakland and didn't think I was going to get to visit any of them until my buddy contacted me after seeing me check in on "Facebook" in the "City of Oakland" he was like "Yo dude you in my hood, I been checking out some cool gastropubs on Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW   Let's check out this place called Portal!" I was stoked because I one didn't know my homie "Yelped" and two because I didn't realize I had bookedmarked it already. END
BEGIN NOW   So I was totally down. END
BEGIN NOW   He swooped me up and we set off. END
BEGIN NOW  It was nice to see a few places I've bookedmarked in Oakland as we drove throughout downtown and the Lake Merrit area. END
BEGIN NOW   But our minds were set, we wanted to step this "Portal" and have some good beer and bar fair. END
BEGIN NOW   It was nice to see Lake Merrit as kinda the. END
BEGIN NOW  "Landmark" if you were trying to find this place and another east bay restarunt that's creating a buzz (rockin crawfish oakland) which is like. END
BEGIN NOW  across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   But back to the reason for this review. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal!. END
BEGIN NOW  Service - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW  Food - 5/5. END
BEGIN NOW  Beer 100/5 :D. END
BEGIN NOW  The Warriors played this day so this place went from like empty to packed house in like a 10 min span. END
BEGIN NOW   Not to mention my NY Yankees were playing as well so. END
BEGIN NOW  I was indeed having a great day. END
BEGIN NOW   My homie and I started with some 805's (beer) with bbq and hot wings for starters. END
BEGIN NOW   Of you've had 805 before, its a pretty good light beer made here in cali, it really compliments light foods in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW   The wings were prefect! Fried just right, the sauces were just enough and not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus the prices were pretty good on the food and beer here as well (see my my pics for prices and menu shots!) oh. END
BEGIN NOW  and if you get a pitcher of the "Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme 11% abv" be prepared to take a "Uber or Lyft" home :D. END
BEGIN NOW  Will I go back?. END
BEGIN NOW  In a heartbeat!. END
BEGIN NOW  In conclusion, this place is perfect for hanging out, happy hour, dates, shenanigans and just chillaxing. END
BEGIN NOW   And with the Patio, I'm sure the ambiance at night is just pretty ill with Lake Merrit as the backdrop. END
BEGIN NOW   I say if you've bookedmarked this place before, I would say give it a go! You will like it here! Of not. END
BEGIN NOW  you just hard to please! :D As always yelp your own experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland you have a winner! My first time at this place & I loved everything about this hipster spot. END
BEGIN NOW  We got there right at 10am when they opened. END
BEGIN NOW   I can see where the wait can be a little long especially if you want to sit on the patio (which has a gorgeous view of Lake Merit). END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone at the table had a little bit of everything. END
BEGIN NOW   The Migas, The Drunk Bread, Guacamole, French Toast. END
BEGIN NOW   We loved all the food. END
BEGIN NOW   I will definitely be back next time I am in town. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  cannot forget the bottomless Mimosas!. END
BEGIN NOW  On the outskirts of Lake Merrit, you will find that this little pub/beer garden pleasantly awaits you. END
BEGIN NOW   You really can't beat Portal's back patio. END
BEGIN NOW   Especially because, the inside of Portal isn't huge - think a few tables and a bar. END
BEGIN NOW   That back patio, tho. END
BEGIN NOW   Communal seating - so, think beer garden steez. END
BEGIN NOW   I've been a few times at wonky hours, think 3:30 looking for brunch and sadly, they stick to dining hours for food, although you can always order drinks and items like fries and such. END
BEGIN NOW   Another huge pro about Portal is their beer list. END
BEGIN NOW   Craft beer aficionnados, you will not be disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had their bloody mary and it's good, not the best, but real solid. END
BEGIN NOW   As always, more accoutrements, please. END
BEGIN NOW   And to my surprise, no vodka in this bad boy, soju only. END
BEGIN NOW   Just an fyi if you happen to be a BM purist. END
BEGIN NOW   They do offer some bottomless mimosa deals during weekend brunch hours, but you'll have to go inquire about prices. END
BEGIN NOW  Most recently for lunch, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my cobb salad and the surprise happy ending. END
BEGIN NOW   No, not that one, ya scumbags. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a delicious, almost pizza like dough that serves as the bottom layer of the salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Score. END
BEGIN NOW   A pretty hefty salad that isn't cheap at $14, but quite filling and freshly filled with juicy chicken, crisp bacon, eggs and so on; pretty much the most unhealthy salad on earth. END
BEGIN NOW   Yep, that's me. END
BEGIN NOW   Other items that piqued my fancy: the burger, the garbage bread, the meatball sub and those fries looked mighty fine. END
BEGIN NOW  Go. END
BEGIN NOW   Drink beer. END
BEGIN NOW   Enjoy that Oakland sunshine and eat!. END
BEGIN NOW  I've  not been in awhile they've been pretty busy which is awesome for them, so I went in today and it's just gotten soo casual in service to a point of rude. END
BEGIN NOW  The glass was dirty and the server was poignantly rude by rolling he's eyes slightly when asked for a new one ya know what, I left,I've had enough of Portals slight distain. END
BEGIN NOW   I adored portal when they first set foot in the space wasabi once was but now sits a pissy example of they're former selves,polite cool,easy,clean selves. END
BEGIN NOW  Now it seems like any other place overblown semi ok food staff who seems put out by the customers of which I should add wasn't at capacity so I was surprised at the very lack of any service. END
BEGIN NOW   I've actually wanted to say this last bit for a while about the food the last few times we'd gone in it just seemed lacking undercooked food mostly. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm bummed I really did like this place. END
BEGIN NOW  We got to the restaurant 20 minutes before it opened for saturday brunch and there was already a huge line. END
BEGIN NOW   I think a lot of the line is for those who want to sit outside on a beautiful sunny Oakland day. END
BEGIN NOW   And even with the line, they'll offer to get your brunch drink started. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   I wish I remembered the name of the fella that served us but he was incredibly helpful, patient and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW   Portions are HUGE so order accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW  We go the bottomless mimosa and their pours are SERIOUS. END
BEGIN NOW   it's pretty much champagne with a tiny splash of OJ. END
BEGIN NOW   Seth Rogan looking bartender: you are on point. END
BEGIN NOW   My faves in terms of food:. END
BEGIN NOW  Garbage Bread- it's a pizza burito. END
BEGIN NOW   get the meat one. END
BEGIN NOW   get it. END
BEGIN NOW   eat it. END
BEGIN NOW   you're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW  Stuffed Challah French Toast- I thought i was done eating but my arm was still shoveling it in my face. END
BEGIN NOW  Tempeh Hash- we got it with poached eggs and goat cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   perfect recommendation. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely will be coming back to enjoy the rest of the menu and the ambience outside!. END
BEGIN NOW  The door is an actual porthole. END
BEGIN NOW   Talk about puns!!. END
BEGIN NOW  I actually had a difficult time opening the door because it was so heavy lol and then I started questioning if that was even was the door in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW   To my embarrassment, it was! You just need to pull a little harder then normal. END
BEGIN NOW   I was visiting a friend and local native at Portal for a quick beer and a much needed catch up. END
BEGIN NOW   We were seated right away and the place had a lot of character! They have a wide selection of beer and wine and a phenomenal happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW  The server was cheery and helpful--he recommended the steak which was cooked to perfection! It was so tender and the seasoning was nothing like I've ever had before. END
BEGIN NOW   My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It's definitely a steak I will never forget. END
BEGIN NOW   We had some veggies on the side which were asparagus and several different types of squash that were in season--a perfect pairing with the steak. END
BEGIN NOW   The meal was very filling and we ended up sitting there talking for hours. END
BEGIN NOW  It started getting busy around 8pm and people were rolling in for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   This is a fantastic place if you live nearby and want to grab drinks after work. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm so jealous that there isn't one near me in Sacramento! Their employees are friendly and made spot-on recommendations about the food and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  Alright Portal, you surprised me last night. END
BEGIN NOW   I've eaten there seeeeeeveral times and was meh about the food. END
BEGIN NOW   But last night, my ravioli was #onpoint though. END
BEGIN NOW   Dude ate the meatball sammy which came with a heaaaaalthy portion of greens. END
BEGIN NOW   Thanks for keeping it healthy. END
BEGIN NOW   You always have an excellent selection of beers. END
BEGIN NOW   While neither of us had any of the Brewery doing the tap takeover, I love that you were a supporter of beer week. END
BEGIN NOW  The three stars because in all of my other experiences there, the food was okay. END
BEGIN NOW   So perhaps the dinner entrees are just better than the brunch? I'll have to go again before I can leave a higher rating for that. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, it closes at 11 and there's not a full bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I understand but hey. END
BEGIN NOW  sometimes I just need a shot of vodka. END
BEGIN NOW   ;). END
BEGIN NOW  But it's a cute spot to go and have a few brews with the homies yo. END
BEGIN NOW   With a large patio and hopefully running heat lamps on cold days, it's a nice spot to go near the lake or after Rockin Crawfish. END
BEGIN NOW  I learned a very important lesson during my visit to Portal Restaurant: never visit an establishment that has multiple signs posted on the front of the building advertising the need and higher for chefs. END
BEGIN NOW   After a twenty minute wait to be seated on an early Saturday night, we were guided to four seats at a community table. END
BEGIN NOW   I think the draw of Portal or many is the large outdoor patio with views of Lake Merritt, is truly is picturesque. END
BEGIN NOW   The adult beverage list is fairly average for the area (although they claim to be a "beer garden" their selection and simply lack of beer menus makes me question this claim), their dinner menu is set with several appetizer and entree items but is not extensive. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered sharing plates for four people which included:. END
BEGIN NOW  *ricotta bites: as delicious as they sound, fried on the outside, cheesy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Portion came with four bites and a marinara sauce (sauce to bites ratio was off, request more sauce if you ever see your waitress!). END
BEGIN NOW  *cesar salad: OK, covered with parmesan cheese and house-made croutons, large portion but lacked flavor and dressing to lettuce ratio was off. END
BEGIN NOW  *brussels sprouts: Good, but damn, I feel like a good home-chef should be able to whip up some taste brussels, and these aren't any better than what I can make a home. END
BEGIN NOW  *garbage bread: Best part of the meal, hands down! Tasty, flavorful, crispy and chewy: this is their signature dish. END
BEGIN NOW   It's served with a the same marinara sauce sauce as the ricotta bites and a overly powerful pesto sauce that I'd recommend skipping. END
BEGIN NOW   Try to get extra marinara sauce when the food is dropped off. END
BEGIN NOW  *chicken wings: This was the most disappointing part of the evening. END
BEGIN NOW   We received our chicken wings (granted, our dishes were coming out in stages, so they weren't rushing to prepare everything at the same time) and the chicken was RAW. END
BEGIN NOW   We pointed it out to our waitress, she said "yes, that's raw!" and returned it to the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   Not acknowledgment more from her, no visit from the chef or manager, simply embarrassing and a terrible way to conduct business. END
BEGIN NOW   The only acknowledgement from our waitress (who practically abandoned our table!) was if we'd like to order something else instead. END
BEGIN NOW   The chicken wings weren't included on the check but our replacement item was. END
BEGIN NOW  *garlic fries: (replacement for chicken) very lackluster, they're the a-typical garlic fry of every restaurant out there. END
BEGIN NOW  I believe that Portal has been nights, but I'd stay far away until they have consistency in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   If you see that they're hiring chefs, RUN!. END
BEGIN NOW  Coming for a weekend brunch? Expect a wait - everyone wants to eat here! We came here on a rainy day and even then, there was a long line of people waiting for some brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW  PARKING: Street parking - plenty! We were able to find street parking no problem. END
BEGIN NOW  SEATING: Indoor & outdoor seating available (but when it's raining, only indoor seating available). END
BEGIN NOW   Not very many tables inside which is probably why there's a long line. END
BEGIN NOW  BAR: There's a bar also! You can grab a drink while you're waiting for your table. END
BEGIN NOW   Weekend brunch calls for AYCD mimosas from opening til 1pm!. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD: Soooo many great options! I had the Portal Benedict (you can add ham, bacon, or avocado for an extra $3). END
BEGIN NOW   You won't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu! Other highlights are the Corned Beef Hash. END
BEGIN NOW   We're in to try the Garbage Bread next time - we didn't want any leftovers this time. END
BEGIN NOW  A-okay Portal! We'll be back :) Maybe on a sunny day so we can enjoy some brunch and a stroll around Lake Merritt. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal is a gem in Oakland! It's located right next to Lake Merritt and from the outside seating, you can get a pretty nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   Came here during an off hour between lunch and dinner! The waiter was super nice and accommodating, letting us pick wherever we wanted to sit outside. END
BEGIN NOW  We started off by ordering two beers. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a pretty good variety of standard mixes and other interesting flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   The waiter helped make recommendations depending on our tastes of dark, light, and so on. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the meat garbage bread (Yelp told me to, so I had to!!) and the garlic bread meatball sub. END
BEGIN NOW   The meatballs were recommended but I love garlic bread so I figured why not mix the two of those together! The garlic bread meatball sub also came with a side salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Those two orders were more than enough for the two of us and we actually had some leftover. END
BEGIN NOW  I definitely recommend the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't let the name fool you. END
BEGIN NOW  it's definitely not garbage! The garbage bread was a treasure. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the cheese melted on top and the inside was stuffed with delicious goodies. END
BEGIN NOW   The meatball garlic sub was good but not incredibly impressive. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe it's because I'm not too big of a fan of meatballs to begin with. END
BEGIN NOW   It was definitely good but just wasn't as mind blowing as the garbage bread. END
BEGIN NOW  I plan on coming back to Portal for brunch sometime so I heard there's a great unlimited mimosa option and they have an amazing menu for breakfast! This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat before a baseball game (which we did)!. END
BEGIN NOW  I can't think of one bad time here at Portal. END
BEGIN NOW   It's always a good time! From brunch to dinner, all times of the day are great at this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Love brunch on the patio because of all the natural sunlight that fills the backyard and love dinner on the patio too because they crank up the jams and it's beautifully lit with string lights to set the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW  Recs: Lunch- herbed garlic fries are incredible (what's in that frying oil?!), Turkey Mini Burger is my fave out all their sliders. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch- must try their polenta!. END
BEGIN NOW  Dinner- Turkey Meatballs, no need to add pasta if you're looking for a carb-less entree, so hearty and deliciously tender. END
BEGIN NOW   Fried Brussel Sprouts, the smell is intoxicating. END
BEGIN NOW  I missed out on the bottomless mimosa but glad I ordered Mr. END
BEGIN NOW   Pickles! Portal pickle their own garnishes and boy did they all go well with the spicy drink!. END
BEGIN NOW  We came around 11 on a Saturday and wait was about 20 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   This was right before the brunch rush and one of the Warriors playoffs! Would have love to enjoy their outside patio which was spacious but pretty exposed to the sun. END
BEGIN NOW   So we sat at the bar with our awesome female bartender/server, enjoyed our food and watched the Warriors kicked the Rockets booties till they were red!. END
BEGIN NOW  Ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW  1. END
BEGIN NOW   House coffee - strong and good. END
BEGIN NOW  2. END
BEGIN NOW   Mr. END
BEGIN NOW   Pickles - obsessed with it. END
BEGIN NOW  3. END
BEGIN NOW   Portal Benedict - never had it on grilled polenta before so it was a unique taste. END
BEGIN NOW   Good but very filling. END
BEGIN NOW  4. END
BEGIN NOW   BF and I were so full but decided to be pigs and stuffed ourselves more with the Stuffed Challah French toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Also good but there was something else other then the ricotta filling in between those bread. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure if it was banana or plantain. END
BEGIN NOW  which I'm not a big fan of. END
BEGIN NOW  Other then that, for a bar that serves food. END
BEGIN NOW  Portal got my vote as a go-to spot for brunch or just a drink on their patio!. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything about this place is Meh. END
BEGIN NOW  The food, service, ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW   It's all meh. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm sure hipsters love this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Had my birthday dinner here on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW   We were greeted and sat quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  We tried the Sonoma bourbon cider ($6) prairie bomb beer ($12) for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   The cider came in a bottle along with a glass. END
BEGIN NOW   It was okay, not as good as I had hopped. END
BEGIN NOW   The prairie bomb was a dark beer. END
BEGIN NOW   I normally hate dark beer due to the bitterness. END
BEGIN NOW   This one was great. END
BEGIN NOW   We took down the name so we can find it later. END
BEGIN NOW  For dinner we ordered the meat garbage bread ($15) 2- sliders ($13) and BBQ frites ($8) When the food came I noticed the sliders weren't the ones we ordered. END
BEGIN NOW   Our server didn't come by for some time so we ate the garbage bread which was fabulous and the fries were great with the dipping sauces. END
BEGIN NOW   When I told our server about the slider error I asked to just have it removed from the bill since we were too stuffed to eat anymore. END
BEGIN NOW  The server came back with our bill and said the manager gave a little discount ($3. END
BEGIN NOW  90) due to the mix up. END
BEGIN NOW   That was a nice gesture. END
BEGIN NOW  The atmosphere has dim lighting, nice outdoor area and bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Hipster kind of place,. END
BEGIN NOW  No hard alcohol available. END
BEGIN NOW   Cocktails are made with suju. END
BEGIN NOW   Beer and wine available. END
BEGIN NOW  Here's the deal: I hate waiting in long lines. END
BEGIN NOW   In my experience, to avoid that and still eat breakfast here, you basically have to get here and wait for them to open. END
BEGIN NOW   For me, that means getting my butt out of bed and being outside before 8am on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW  BUT, here is what I will say. END
BEGIN NOW  - I'm that overly discerning jerk who cares about how my eggs are poached when I go to breakfast or brunch and they do them perfectly here. END
BEGIN NOW  - the coffee is delish and plentiful (Highwire, I believe). END
BEGIN NOW  - the potatoes are a mix of shredded hash and chunkier potato bits, nice and crispy (if it's not obvious from that description. END
BEGIN NOW   they're great). END
BEGIN NOW  - their biscuits are great, sweet or savory. END
BEGIN NOW  4 stars instead of 5 because I've had a couple misses here. END
BEGIN NOW   I think it was when they had first opened up. END
BEGIN NOW   In any case, I think most folks will find something they'll like on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  've had pretty much everything on their menu, and every item is so great and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Um, delicious coffee (Highwire), delish micheladas, delish food and pastries. END
BEGIN NOW   Obviously it sucks to wait in line, but whatever- this is the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW   Get used to it. END
BEGIN NOW   I like to get there early and beat the later crowd. END
BEGIN NOW  And please send whoever designed the space my way--beautiful!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  Weekday late brunch: Nailed it. END
BEGIN NOW  This spot is a total gem, nestled in the Laurel District serving up some really upscale, but down home eats. END
BEGIN NOW   Mostly breakfast, but don't fret, they do have some lunch options as well. END
BEGIN NOW   All their breads and pastries are made in house, they serve organic eggs and all meats are antibiotic and hormone free. END
BEGIN NOW   My health does matter, thank you very much!. END
BEGIN NOW  My goat cheese omelet ($13) was what dreams are made of: a fluffy omelet oozing with goat cheese, snap peas, asparagus, garlic and spring onions. END
BEGIN NOW   I inhaled it. END
BEGIN NOW   In addition to this perfect egg dish, were some crispy potatoes, salad and perfectly toasted homemade bread with house made jam. END
BEGIN NOW   DAYUUUUMMMMM. END
BEGIN NOW   Writing this review is taking back to pure eating bliss. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee was solid and prices are fair for portion sizes and service was lovely. END
BEGIN NOW   Granted, it wasn't busy at all, but this spot is a neighborhood joint and service is to match. END
BEGIN NOW   I can imagine some frustration during those weekend hours, but well worth the wait; I loved everything about Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW  Items I will be returning for: strawberry cream cheese danish, the beef hash and that cubano sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW   Sign me up. END
BEGIN NOW  A new and not-so-much longer hidden gem in Oakland's Laurel District that is the perfect place for a weekend brunch on one of those sunny days that Oakland is famous for! I am a real fan of this great neighborhood diner where everything is homemade from their pastries to their jams in addition to their classic dishes for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   And Sequoia Diner lives up the hype that's been expressed from so many reviews and images posted from my fellow Yelpers!. END
BEGIN NOW  I actually found out about Sequoia Diner due to the fact it seemed like it was on Yelp's "New Businesses in East Bay" for an eternity! It actually opened about a year ago, replacing the long-standing Full House Cafe, by a local husband and wife duo who wanted to stay loyal to the neighborhood with their seasonal brunch classics served all morning until mid-afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW   There is so much buzz for Sequoia Diner that wait times can be quite long for brunch and parking on MacArthur Avenue and the surrounding area can be quite dicey. END
BEGIN NOW   So plan ahead it you don't mind waiting. END
BEGIN NOW   Luckily, I had friends who were eager enough to get there early and put our names down and patient enough for me to get there just a wee bit late. END
BEGIN NOW  Once we were sat in their patent leather booths, we each knew what we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW   (I had been doing enough research from my fellow Yelper's images and reviews to know what to order and what to pass up. END
BEGIN NOW  ) We knew we all had to get the highly-recommended Pecan Sticky Buns and at $3. END
BEGIN NOW  75 each it's a good deal, so much so, the three of us ordered two buns to share. END
BEGIN NOW   I found them not too sweet or sticky with the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and topped with an abundance of chopped pecans. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a perfect accompaniment to your coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  As for my main dish, I knew that some Sequoia Diner plates were heavier than others, but I also wanted to taste some of the best and unique dishes that they have to offer to get a read on how they prepare their meals here. END
BEGIN NOW   So I went with the Country Breakfast with its biscuit and gravy, collared greens, hash browns and two eggs made to order. END
BEGIN NOW   Although obviously heavy, my dish was solid, I especially loved the creamy gravy, warm biscuit, and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW   You could tell with the first bite how much homemade goodness was put into your meal. END
BEGIN NOW   Despite being constantly busy, the service for the most part was attentive and there was constant turnover of the tables and counter-tops, made the flow of service that much more pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW  Sequoia Diner is your classic mom-and-pop owned and operated American breakfast joint with modern day sustainable and locavore sensibilities. END
BEGIN NOW   Their eclectic menu makes me want to come back for more, everything sounds so familiar yet so unique that it seems like you can't go wrong. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't wait to return one day to see how Sequoia Diner continues to build upon their success in a loyal and foodie loving neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW  I never loved brunch much, always made me feel comatose and heavy afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW    SD has the sweetspot between comfort and fresh. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're ordering to-go, it's a good idea to call ahead, it took upwards of 30 minutes to get my order, there isn't much seating for those waiting, I ordered a coffee to hold me over while waiting, comes in super cute beige/brown cups, reminds me of the 70s and 80s. END
BEGIN NOW    Such a pleasant throwback to a simpler time. END
BEGIN NOW  LOVED the Red Flannel Hash. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfectly poached eggs, kraut to cut the richness, cubes of al dente beets and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW    They don't take substitutions. END
BEGIN NOW    I wanted to swap out one of the eggs for some chard, but had to order it separately. END
BEGIN NOW    Sour cream was mysteriously left off - perfect, I was going to omit it anyways. END
BEGIN NOW  Homemade sourdough toast were a nice counterpart to the meal. END
BEGIN NOW    Comes pre-buttered. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're there after 11AM, there are additional items you can order, got an asparagus, pea, arugula salad. END
BEGIN NOW    Sounds simple but the details were there: toasted almonds, slices of orange/blood orange, kumquats and pickled green beans. END
BEGIN NOW    Wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW  Will be my mid-day treat going forward. END
BEGIN NOW    Everything seasoned well. END
BEGIN NOW    Carefully and expertly prepared. END
BEGIN NOW    So nice to have this quality of food available. END
BEGIN NOW    4 items: $35 including tax/tip. END
BEGIN NOW  I love brunch but I don't always love brunch food. END
BEGIN NOW    So, it is no surprise that my hunt for the perfect local brunch spot has extended well into my second year in Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm pleased to report the search is over. END
BEGIN NOW    Sequoia elevates humble breakfast staples -- not with a bunch of unnecessary frippery -- but by paying exquisite attention to the details. END
BEGIN NOW    Baked items are made in house including the incredible fresh biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW    The menu rotates with interesting seasonal specials. END
BEGIN NOW    On one visit, the loco moco had an incredibly rich shortrib gravy. END
BEGIN NOW    On the next, appetizers included chicken liver toasts with chicken cracklings and fig jam. END
BEGIN NOW    Good, simple food, presumably inspired by the personal tastes and whims of the chef (as well as the season) and made with heart and smarts. END
BEGIN NOW  I don't understand the long wait for this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is good, but not especially amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd say it is pretty normal American food. END
BEGIN NOW   Perhaps my wife and I missed out by not getting any of their baked goods. END
BEGIN NOW  When I saw Hazel's pictures from Sequoia Diner less than a month ago, I knew I needed to get myself over here soon. END
BEGIN NOW    Apparently I was not quick enough as word is out and an hour long wait seemed to be the constant on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW  Upon arrival, since no one was up front, I grabbed a pen and was about to put my name down on the list but a few seconds later discovered that they have a hostess taking names and got my 1 hour wait estimate. END
BEGIN NOW    They do allow you to buy a coffee to enjoy outside while you wait so this non coffee drinker did the next best thing and ordered a sticky bun to go making the wait more bearable. END
BEGIN NOW    It was love at first bite as it was not overly sweet and enough pecans with each bite. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated within 45 minutes allowing me to digest that sticky bun freeing up stomach space to fully enjoy their breakfast plates. END
BEGIN NOW    I already had my eye on the beef hash with poached eggs which was just a plate of beautiful flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   Slight saltiness of the beef hash paired with the tartness from the pickled cabbage topped with the creaminess of the poached eggs and the final punch of the arugula will have you scraping up every morsel. END
BEGIN NOW    Since hubby didn't realize that the Red Flannel Hash did not already come with meat (bacon can be added for a charge), he did end up polishing off at least 1/3 of my beef hash and slice of my bread to be satisfied (good thing I was pre-fortified with that sticky bun). END
BEGIN NOW    I had a bite of his Red Flannel Hash which had great flavors as well for a vegetarian option but I do prefer the Beef Hash one. END
BEGIN NOW  I thought the Coconut Thai Ice Tea was good and smooth with the coconut milk but like Hazel, felt like the tea flavor was way too light. END
BEGIN NOW    I rather use that $4 for another sticky bun!!. END
BEGIN NOW  What a dream on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW   Their hours are limited (sad face!) but if you can make it out here for brunch, YOU MUST!!!! Yep, this place is multiple exclamation point good. END
BEGIN NOW   My second visit was this morning at 8 am on the dot (mind you, daylight savings time just happened so it's really like 7 am and it was raining) and there were a few hungry peeps waiting outside to come in. END
BEGIN NOW  It is absolutely worth starting every meal here with a pecan sticky bun. END
BEGIN NOW   Warm and fluffy, and most importantly, totally shareable. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm telling you, you cannot be mad about anything in life after eating one of these. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like napping in a field with a hundred lambs. END
BEGIN NOW   And the coffee? Fill 'er up! They frequently make rounds to top you off of the dark, delicious brew. END
BEGIN NOW  I haven't strayed from the Country Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   I just can't! Eggs any style, biscuit with gravy, hashbrowns, collard greens. END
BEGIN NOW   I could not design a better breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   I am a serious biscuit snob (they're so simple and yet people somehow ruin the simplicity of it) and I can say, Sequoia rocks the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like the Pat Benatar of biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW   Eventually I will try their huevos rancheros. END
BEGIN NOW  The diner is bright, inviting, and has that Northern Oakland vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   They were smart about the design of the tables, where you can easily transition seating from 2 to larger groups. END
BEGIN NOW   However, this place is definitely not huge, so I have no idea how long it would take to accommodate a larger party during prime time. END
BEGIN NOW   Meanwhile, it's a perfect location for my 1:1 time with my besties. END
BEGIN NOW  Skip Montclair's subpar spots, and give Sequoia Diner a shot. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd had this bookmarked for a while, but ventured into the Laurel District in East Oakland for the first time this morning. END
BEGIN NOW   I was surprised to see that none of my trusted East Bay Yelpers had reviewed this place but was excited to give it a whirl. END
BEGIN NOW  We arrived around 8:30 and found the place mostly full, but were able to grab the last available booth with no wait. END
BEGIN NOW   It has that diner charm, with a long bar counter and several booths along the wall. END
BEGIN NOW   This isn't the place to bring a large group, but it is perfectly cozy for 2 or 4. END
BEGIN NOW   There are several adorable waitresses that were super friendly, greeting you on the way in and out, and keeping the coffee coming. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the positive vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  I like that they keep the menu relatively simple, with several classics, and a few twists. END
BEGIN NOW   No kids menu here, per se, but my boys were happy with their pastries. END
BEGIN NOW  a pecan roll and the strawberry cream cheese danish. END
BEGIN NOW   They stood on their own as a small breakfast, but would be equally nice as a shared starter while you wait on the main event. END
BEGIN NOW  I was thrilled with the mushroom and spinach scramble which, like their other egg dishes, come with some perfectly cooked and seasoned potatoes, some excellent sourdough toast, and a small rocket salad. END
BEGIN NOW   Seemingly simple, but it leaves you wondering why you can't do 'em that perfect at home. END
BEGIN NOW  The Highwire brewed coffee wasn't my favorite, but it did the trick and my cup was never empty or cold. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all, a real winner that will get added to the Sunday rotation!. END
BEGIN NOW  I was sold when I saw that they have Pecan Sticky Buns!  I love sticky buns and for some reason, it's really hard to find it in the Bay Area. END
BEGIN NOW    I used to get them at Berkeley Bowl, but they don't have it anymore. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm also very particular about my sticky buns. END
BEGIN NOW    Often the dough is not soft enough, it is too sweet or there is too much cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW    Sequoia Diner's Pecan Sticky Bun is perfect in all respects and the price is right too. END
BEGIN NOW    $3. END
BEGIN NOW  75 for one is quite reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a nice size, so two people can easily share one. END
BEGIN NOW   We ended up ordering one with our breakfast, and I took their last one to go. END
BEGIN NOW    It'll go great with my coffee tomorrow morning!. END
BEGIN NOW  We did have other breakfast items as well. END
BEGIN NOW    My husband ordered the Beef Hash dish which came with a couple of perfectly poached eggs, pickled beets, arugula salad and carrots. END
BEGIN NOW    His plate was very colorful, and most importantly, the beef hash was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    He loved it and he was nice enough to let me taste it. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of sausage. END
BEGIN NOW   As I already had half of a sticky bun, I thought I'd just order a couple of sides and skip a big entree. END
BEGIN NOW    The biscuit was quite large and it was flaky, tender and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW    It came with a nice amount of gravy. END
BEGIN NOW    The gravy was a little under seasoned, so I had to add some salt and pepper on top. END
BEGIN NOW    The sausages were perfect with the Biscuit and Gravy. END
BEGIN NOW    You can tell that the sausages were house made and thankfully they weren't salty. END
BEGIN NOW  As for beverages, I ordered Coconut Thai Iced Tea and the hubby had the Decaf Highwire. END
BEGIN NOW    We brew Highwire Coffee at home, so we were happy to see that on their menu. END
BEGIN NOW    I was really glad they use coconut milk for their Thai Iced Tea. END
BEGIN NOW    It was really good, though I'd like to have a stronger tea flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  There was a wait when we got there around 10:45. END
BEGIN NOW    We waited for about half hour. END
BEGIN NOW   They pretty much have a constant stream of diners, so expect to wait if you go here on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW    Service is very friendly and I really appreciate that everything is made in house. END
BEGIN NOW    We will definitely go back!. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're in the neighborhood and the wait isn't crazy, check it out. END
BEGIN NOW  We knew there wasn't a full espresso menu so put our names in and got lattes across the street at World Ground. END
BEGIN NOW   It made the wait of about 35 minutes enjoyable. END
BEGIN NOW  As others have said, there's another significant wait to get your order and it's loud inside but neither were a problem for us. END
BEGIN NOW   It was nice not to be rushed and I enjoyed watching the openness of the kitchen prep area. END
BEGIN NOW  The blood orange juice was delightfully tart. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm usually partial to big fluffy waffles but I was really digging the thin crispness of theirs. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes were smashed-style and solid. END
BEGIN NOW   The huevos rancheros with chorizo were overpowered by the bold flavor of the sauce but I do appreciate how they make everything in-house, including the meat. END
BEGIN NOW  I really enjoyed coming here for their brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank goodness I came with friends so that I can taste their dish as well!. END
BEGIN NOW  One thing I did not like was that we had to wait for an hour to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW   But then again, what do you expect for Sunday brunch right?!?. END
BEGIN NOW  I order their coconut Thai iced tea and I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW   I believe my friend was indifferent about the drink though. END
BEGIN NOW   My hubby got the matcha almond iced latte and I thought it was OK but he liked it. END
BEGIN NOW   He did get less honey in the drink so if he got it the normal way, I probably would have liked it more. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered their Country Breakfast and that was good, not great. END
BEGIN NOW   It came with a biscuit and sausage gravy, two eggs, greens, and potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   The highlight for this entree was the biscuit since it was so freakin' moist, soft, buttery! I tried my friend's beef hash and I so liked his dish more than mine. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd definitely come back here for their pastries, beef hash, and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW  Sequoia, the new home of the now long-gone and super mediocre Full House, is a little gem of a hipster haven worth pushing past the throngs of screaming toddlers and hoards of impatient soon-to-be patrons for. END
BEGIN NOW   It's pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   Serving up the usual diner fare with their own flare and fancy (and a bit of a price hike, juheard?), Sequoia aims to please by grabbing you in with something you're familiar with and getting a good grip on you with their unique flavors. END
BEGIN NOW   I usually storm the joint on a Sunday or Saturday morning with m'ladies, but today's dolo trip offered a more reflective experience and prompted me to step outside of my usual "two eggs and toast with avo on the side" comfort zone. END
BEGIN NOW  I was surprised to find when I walked up around 10 A. END
BEGIN NOW  M. END
BEGIN NOW   on a Wednesday that the diner already had a significant crowd outside. END
BEGIN NOW   They didn't have pitchforks just yet but they looked like they were hungry enough to turn into an angry mob. END
BEGIN NOW   Luckily, I signed in with the lovely hostess and was at a counter seat within ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   Once seated, I ordered a mimosa and decided today was the day I'd get jiggy with that Red Flannel Hash I had heard so much about and constantly peered over people's heads to get a better look at. END
BEGIN NOW   I also decided to forego the sliced sourdough in favor of a biscuit so I could finally weigh in on those, as I've heard they're pretty good here. END
BEGIN NOW  My mimosa was sad and unimpressive, mostly because the orange juice seemed suspect. END
BEGIN NOW   But the Red Flannel Hash and the biscuit both surpassed my expectations! The Red Flannel Hash is one of those textural and flavor landscapes I live for: warm, crunchy, soft and runny meets savory, sweet, tart and buttery. END
BEGIN NOW   The pickled cabbage that comes with the hash is equal parts culinary genius and just damned good pairing for a poached egg and hash combo. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't really get into the sour cream glob on the side but I'm not a sour cream girl. END
BEGIN NOW  The biscuit is just as buttery and flaky and scrumptious as you've heard. END
BEGIN NOW   But the nuances of seasonality scalded me: I got stuck with cranberry preserves, which were pretty gross. END
BEGIN NOW   Still, the biscuit remained sweet and resilient in the face of something so bitter, as we all should. END
BEGIN NOW   Life lessons, brought to you by Sequoia Diner. END
BEGIN NOW  A great new spot for the best breakfast in town!  You gotta be patient though, as there is always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW    Just put your name on the list and have a cuppa. END
BEGIN NOW  Farm fresh greens and in house biscuits can't be beat!  I have tried the country breakfast and the Benedict - both excellent!  The potatoes are amazing and crispy _ you won't be disappointed!. END
BEGIN NOW  If you have time for a leisurely wait and want your coffee cup "warmed up" as you hang out with the Laurel District gentrifiers, this is your spot. END
BEGIN NOW  At prime time there's quite a wait and the parking shituation  is very competitive on MacArthur. END
BEGIN NOW   The coffee? So-so. END
BEGIN NOW   Are you hungry? The kitchen isn't as speedy as it should be, but "have some more coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  ". END
BEGIN NOW  Been here a few times and this premium-priced trendy breakfast spot serves up great food but is a bit over-hyped. END
BEGIN NOW   The original vision is pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   Hopefully, they can get more efficient to make the wait and price with the visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Still, it's a four star cafe. END
BEGIN NOW  11/20/15. END
BEGIN NOW   Breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  This feels like Valencia Street in San Francisco. END
BEGIN NOW   A diner serves modern twists of traditional breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   The well-lit space has a dining encounter, booths and tables. END
BEGIN NOW   The tables are also reminiscent of the city--they are packed pretty tight. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  *Golden Waffle ($7. END
BEGIN NOW  50) is thin eggo-like topped with candied apples. END
BEGIN NOW   It's the kind of waffle we prefer, not the thick Belgian kind. END
BEGIN NOW  *Spinach and Mushroom Scramble ($12) is the only scramble on the menu so here it is. END
BEGIN NOW   It's perfectly done with runny scrambled egg woven evenly with spinach and fresh mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not a cheese person usually but the Swiss is not overpowering and adds flavor to the egg. END
BEGIN NOW   Served with arugula salad, fried potato and a thick buttered toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Hearty and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee is constantly refilled. END
BEGIN NOW   It's from Hot Wire. END
BEGIN NOW   They also gave fresh-squeezed orange juice. END
BEGIN NOW   The homemade goods for the day are cranberry scone ($3) and pecan sticky bun ($3. END
BEGIN NOW  50) both of which are tempting. END
BEGIN NOW  Berkeley appears to be bleeding into Oakland, as this locally owned and sourced cafe felt like a place you would expect to find about twenty minutes north of this location. END
BEGIN NOW   I've never been to Laurel before, but it's one of those transitional, culturally diverse neighborhoods where you could have a cup of artisan coffee one minute but you feel a need to keep staring at your car while it's parked on the street. END
BEGIN NOW   It's a Temescal-in-waiting, and if it does become the East Bay's next gourmet ghetto, you can thank the husband-and-wife team of Andrew Vennari and Sequoia Broderson who opened this comfy-cozy spot which drew quite a few for breakfast on Saturday morning (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1L2zRnZ). END
BEGIN NOW  As usual in Oakland, I was done with my haircut and found myself here in a peckish state. END
BEGIN NOW   Although it was only about a ten-minute wait for me, I was surprised by the constant stream of people looking to dine here since it's fairly nondescript from the outside. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I could tell why the attraction by the eclectic selection of breakfasts on the menu including a $13 Huevos Rancheros and the same-priced Shakshuka, an Israeli-originated melange of squash, peppers, garbanzo beans, lebni (kefir cheese) and poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   That all sounded appetizing, but I adhered to the Patriot Act and ordered the all-American-sounding Beef Hash (also $13), certainly not a Hormel Mary Kitchen canned creation by any stretch. END
BEGIN NOW  It consisted of shredded slow-braised beef chuck mashed up and fried on the griddle with potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   You could barely see it on the plate because it was covered by big shavings of raw carrots, arugula and a pair of poached eggs with homemade rye toast on the side (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1WEvNpS). END
BEGIN NOW   It looked almost downright healthy but not really, just tasty in a Berkeley commune kind of way with a bit of a kick from a dusting of horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW   As much as I like this dish - and I did - I have to admit it was overshadowed by the sheer flakiness of the freshly baked $3. END
BEGIN NOW  25 Strawberry Scone (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1NieroA). END
BEGIN NOW   Worth every penny and perfectly complemented by the slightly overpriced $2. END
BEGIN NOW  75 cup of Highwire Coffee (photo: bit. END
BEGIN NOW  ly/1Nz1w6h). END
BEGIN NOW   Now where is Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  bold, fresh flavors for such dinerish fare with a standout scone. END
BEGIN NOW  AMBIANCE - 3. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  nice, all-white interior (I mean the walls, not the people. END
BEGIN NOW  sort of) in a neighborhood still looking for its identity. END
BEGIN NOW  SERVICE - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  very friendly and attentive server. END
BEGIN NOW  TOTAL - 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  coming back for the Shakshuka. END
BEGIN NOW  but seriously, where's Laurel again?. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything we have ordered came out delicious! The sticky buns were made so you can dream about them when you are hungry ! it s packed up weekends but the best time is during the week. END
BEGIN NOW   I am soon happy this dinner is in the Laurel district a few blocks from my house. END
BEGIN NOW  Good job!. END
BEGIN NOW  When my old roommate from college decided she wanted eggs for breakfast, Montclair Egg Shop seemed like a very logical answer to her hunger. END
BEGIN NOW   There ended up being a 40 minute wait when we showed up at 12 pm on a Saturday, but that led us to exploring the area for the first time (spoiler: there isn't much to do, but there IS a really good bookstore in the area). END
BEGIN NOW  THE BASICS. END
BEGIN NOW  + It's a very old-fashioned sort of place, like a dusty diner, but in the best possible way. END
BEGIN NOW  + At least 50% of the menu (if not more) focuses on eggs (logically so) - meaning you should really order something with eggs. END
BEGIN NOW  + Service is pretty fast considering how slammed they get for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  + Their egg creations are quite good (egg shop ham & cheese potato pancakes ftw). END
BEGIN NOW  It's kind of amazing that this place has been around and in business for 42 years - definitely a solid place!. END
BEGIN NOW  thought my friend meant "eggslut" when he suggested this place, but either way it's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW   Our server was Antonio and he's just the sweetest thing; genuinely cared about our time there. END
BEGIN NOW  It took me a while to order because I couldn't decide between the french toast or the crêpes, but I thoroughly enjoyed my french toast. END
BEGIN NOW   The ambiance is quaint and mellow, much like the rest of the street outside. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all: service was great, brunch was lovely, and despite their lack of variety in coffee, I definitely recommend this place. END
BEGIN NOW  Ah the egg shop. END
BEGIN NOW   This place seems like an iconic part of Montclair. END
BEGIN NOW  The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW   We came here after my best friend had a minor surgery, and were immediately greeted warmly and seated. END
BEGIN NOW   The hostess took our drink orders, and when we hadn't received them by the time our waiter showed up, he immediately ran to do it himself. END
BEGIN NOW   Very cool. END
BEGIN NOW   To the hostesses' credit, it was super busy, and she apologized. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is. END
BEGIN NOW  okay. END
BEGIN NOW   I opted for chilequiles and was a bit disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW   For one, the eggs were over soft- no choice as to how to cook them, and the salsa was bland. END
BEGIN NOW   The quest fresco was rubbery. END
BEGIN NOW   I went from excited to "I can barely eat this" pretty quickly. END
BEGIN NOW  My best friend got a large waffle with whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW   She said it was pretty damned good. END
BEGIN NOW   Portion sizes are relatively large. END
BEGIN NOW  Basic breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing fancy. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't think I'd spend the money to come back. END
BEGIN NOW  Very nice people working here though. END
BEGIN NOW   The service is good. END
BEGIN NOW  Ohmygoodness!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is beyond cute. END
BEGIN NOW   It's located in their cute little downtown. END
BEGIN NOW  Has a "small-town" vibe to it. END
BEGIN NOW  Walking in - the décor reminded me of Leavenworth in WA - Bavarian. END
BEGIN NOW   SUPER CUTE!. END
BEGIN NOW  You sign-in at the notepad they have at the podium & have a seat. END
BEGIN NOW  There isn't necessarily a hostess - someone behind the counter, cooking was the one that told me to put my name down. END
BEGIN NOW  We were seated immediately - there was no one in front of us - so that could be lucky for us. END
BEGIN NOW  There is ample seating & the restaurant looks a lot smaller than it really is. END
BEGIN NOW  They took our drink orders quickly but took a little longer to take our food orders. END
BEGIN NOW  The food did come quickly though - a PLUS in case you're super hungry. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered one of their specials - Garden Omelet which had asparagus, zucchini, spinach, & a bunch of other stuff. END
BEGIN NOW  I honestly took a couple bites & knew that it wasn't my cup o' tea. END
BEGIN NOW  My whole omelet tasted like asparagus. END
BEGIN NOW   Sure, it wouldn't bother me so much but it was just really bland -_-. END
BEGIN NOW  No flavor whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh! I substituted the potato fries for fruit - as usual it cost extra. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh, my friend ordered bacon on the side & they charged her 4 dollars. END
BEGIN NOW   Just FYI. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all - I wasn't really impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Sad to say, I took the omelet home but pretty much threw it away & made my own omelet. END
BEGIN NOW  One of thine partner in crimes and I had a hankering for a tasty brunch experience and a tall glass'a mimosa to start our New Year off right. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not ashamed to admit that I called several other eateries first to see how long the wait time was (and whether they served alcohol) before we ended up here. END
BEGIN NOW   The wait was about 35 minutes, giving us plenty of time to determine what we would be eating before we were seated. END
BEGIN NOW  I chose two eggs scrambled with jack cheese, home fries, an english muffin and a side of avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   My accomplice dined on the Egg Shop's signature Ham, Cheese & Potato Pancake, which comes with scrambled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   With the exception of my "Home Fried Potatoes", the meal was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes were greasy, undercooked and inedible so I didn't touch them. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend said that her potato pancake was good and didn't suffer from the grease problem that my home freezies did. END
BEGIN NOW   The jealousy was flagrant but I was still happy for her. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus I was too focused on the delicious pomegranate mimosa in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was Adolfo and he was totally attentive, super sweet and didn't make us feel rushed or act irritated even though by the time we were seated the place was pretty much closed. END
BEGIN NOW   And who wouldn't want to get the hell out of their job on New Year's Day? Thanks again!. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the Belgium waffle topped with strawberries, bananas and whipped cream with a side of eggs and bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything was delicious, but I had to knock a star off because their coffee was not my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW   It was bitter and just seemed old. END
BEGIN NOW   It didn't taste like a freshly brewed cup of coffee and that dented my eating experience a bit. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd like to bring my own in the future without being judged. END
BEGIN NOW  The price was great, the ambiance was really cute. END
BEGIN NOW   There's writing on the ceiling and behind the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW   Really neat place. END
BEGIN NOW  Like any good brunch spot, there was a wait and for some reason my cell service was not the best here so talk amongst yourselves. END
BEGIN NOW   hahaha And don't give up on checking in!!. END
BEGIN NOW  The service here is always wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW   All the servers and hosts are super friendly with their guests and each other. END
BEGIN NOW  I always order something different but I love their "make your own" omelets. END
BEGIN NOW   The coffee is good too. END
BEGIN NOW   I think it'd be super cute if the upstairs were open for eating too because there's always a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   But whatever, it's never more than a 15 minute wait. END
BEGIN NOW   You know this place must be great if the neighboring restaurants are usually empty while people are waiting to eat here. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely a favorite!. END
BEGIN NOW  So I wanted to try a new place and this place had good reviews and the food pics looked great. END
BEGIN NOW   The main thing I wanted to get was the pancakes, but by the time the server came to take our order they "ran out" of pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW   How do you run out of pancakes? Can't you just make more batter?. END
BEGIN NOW  Going in it has a very rustic welcoming feel. END
BEGIN NOW   The red brick walls and fireplace makes it more personable. END
BEGIN NOW   Most tables are 2 seaters so because there were 4 of us we were seated in the back. END
BEGIN NOW   It was nice and quiet. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Egg Shop Ham&Cheese Potato Pancake and hubby got the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW   The potato pancake is basically hash browns with ham and cheese which I was looking forward to. END
BEGIN NOW   Unfortunately I was informed it has cilantro which it doesn't state on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   It also didn't state it contains onions and green onions which I discovered after taking my first bite. END
BEGIN NOW   That's about when my gag reflex kicked in. END
BEGIN NOW   Me and onions don't like each other. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd never have ordered it if it said those 2 items were in there. END
BEGIN NOW   Ended up eating my daughter's French toast while she ate the hubby's side order of Belgian waffle. END
BEGIN NOW   Yeah they can make waffles but not pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW  Hubby was not impressed by the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW   It was ok but was more potatoes and veggies than corned beef. END
BEGIN NOW  Their soft drinks were a cup of ice with a soda can so no "refills". END
BEGIN NOW   At $1. END
BEGIN NOW  50-$2. END
BEGIN NOW  50 a can I opted for water. END
BEGIN NOW  A little pricey but ok for just me and hubby. END
BEGIN NOW   Not a place we'd bring the kids because our kids eat more than their serving size. END
BEGIN NOW   Lol. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all it was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW   I might try it again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it and I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone just yet. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe next time. END
BEGIN NOW  maybe. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious french toast and Belgian waffles :). END
BEGIN NOW   With fresh strawberries and whipped cream! Their orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and all of their servers were very nice!! The ambience was chill and kind of eccentric but I liked it! Clowns and trains, and old timey things. END
BEGIN NOW   My only complaint! Was one particularly creepy waiter who worked there and hit on me and my sister and stared every time he walked by. END
BEGIN NOW   Not what I'm looking for with my breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW  A little disappointed in this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Came here on a Sunday at 10:30am. END
BEGIN NOW   Limited street parking because there is a farmer's market. END
BEGIN NOW   Also took 30 mins to get a table. END
BEGIN NOW   Guess it's the only joint in town. END
BEGIN NOW   Ordered the Benedict with crab cake and also the bloody mary with sake. END
BEGIN NOW   My benedict was very disapponting. END
BEGIN NOW   Eggs were overcooked. END
BEGIN NOW   When I cut into them, the yolk was cooked. END
BEGIN NOW   Also there was avocado skin in my meal that should have been thrown out and random peices of corn?? As for the bloody mary, there was nothing special tasting about it. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall, had high hopes, but the meal was just ok. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here on a Sunday morning. END
BEGIN NOW    It was packed and there was a long wait. END
BEGIN NOW    Food and service were both good. END
BEGIN NOW    I had the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW    Very good!  Nice spot, highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW  Omg. END
BEGIN NOW   Their jam though. END
BEGIN NOW   Homemade. END
BEGIN NOW  Apricot jam. END
BEGIN NOW   I wanted to steal the whole jar haha! I always get their scramble which is nicely done. END
BEGIN NOW   The eggs are in the runnier side and that's the way I like my eggs! It was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  I feel conflicted about giving this place only 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I have nothing but good memories at this neighborhood place (used to come here in high school). END
BEGIN NOW   The service was wonderful but the food was pretty mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW   My eggs benedict was soggy from the generous amount of hollandaise. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't get me wrong, I love hollandaise with all my heart, but there is such a thing as too much. END
BEGIN NOW   I could also tell that the crab cake had a ton of filler/binder. END
BEGIN NOW   Kind of a nitpicky complaint, but my avocado slices were bruised (at least cut away the bruised parts). END
BEGIN NOW   Bf really liked his potato pancakes though. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfectly crisp and seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW   Food here is like diner food but better, but only a little better. END
BEGIN NOW   The plastic plates and dingy cups don't help. END
BEGIN NOW  We typically go here for breakfast meetings and it is never a disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW    They have a variety of breakfast items to choose from, whether you have a hankering for a standard 2 eggs and bacon breakfast or maybe a sweeter dish like waffles, or more ethnic dish like breakfast tacos, they have it here!. END
BEGIN NOW  Yesterday I ordered the breakfast tacos which honestly is the best deal. END
BEGIN NOW    For 8. END
BEGIN NOW  95, you get two tacos with greens, bacon, and eggs how you want it, covered with salsa and a side of half an avocado. END
BEGIN NOW    As you can see from the picture, it's a huge dish!. END
BEGIN NOW  Great flavor and fast service. END
BEGIN NOW    On the weekends though, there may be a wait. END
BEGIN NOW   But, totally worth it!. END
BEGIN NOW  +/- THE FOOD. END
BEGIN NOW  I had really high expectations for this place seeing that it was so packed when I went. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the chicken apple sausage scramble and a pomegranate mimosa and it was just alright. END
BEGIN NOW   The scramble was rather bland and didn't have any attributes that stood out to me. END
BEGIN NOW   The mimosa was definitely 80% champagne and 20% juice. END
BEGIN NOW   I tasted no pomegranate whatosever. END
BEGIN NOW   I also tried my friend's regular orange mimosa and same thing- too much champagne. END
BEGIN NOW  + THE ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is absolutely adorable. END
BEGIN NOW   It's like you stepped into a little cottage from a storybook. END
BEGIN NOW   The restaurant is neatly decorated with a bunch of gadgets and gizmos like toy trains and inspirational quotes on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW   The place is pretty small but very clean. END
BEGIN NOW  We went to the Montclair Egg Shop this week for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW   We were seated right away. END
BEGIN NOW   I was hungry so I ordered the challah bread French toast and an omelette with bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, and jack cheese. END
BEGIN NOW  The omelette was your standard size and was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   The French toast was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread was too flat/thin and it tasted just okay. END
BEGIN NOW  The prices were good and the service was good as well. END
BEGIN NOW   We will return!. END
BEGIN NOW  Breakfast of Champions! You know it's that good if you saw Andre Iguodala enjoying his breakfast while you were here. END
BEGIN NOW   Shared the potato pancake and salmon scramble, both were delicious and hearty. END
BEGIN NOW  NBA Finals MVP approved! #StrengthInNumbers #NBAChamps #Warriors. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is good. END
BEGIN NOW  Nice atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW  Attractive interior. END
BEGIN NOW  If you are into America style breakfast no doubt it suits to your pallet. END
BEGIN NOW  Vs decent European breakfast places eg in the nicer parts of London, there is way more sugar and other high glycogen index ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW   such ingredients are not too my taste, leave me feeling bloated and of course contributes to putting on weight. END
BEGIN NOW  scrambled eggs with salmon:-- like most America breakfast the egg was more like an omelet chopped up. END
BEGIN NOW   The salmon is mixed in to the egg, which also makes it more difficult to cook to the best consistency. END
BEGIN NOW  old fashioned oaks:-- expecting big fat Scottish rolled oats which typically have lots of flavour, but found them to be more like typical modern rolled oats. END
BEGIN NOW   I asked for no sugar but there was shed loads of both brown sugar and honey. END
BEGIN NOW   It was sweeter than a pudding. END
BEGIN NOW   The oats were also overlooked and had lost all there lost form. END
BEGIN NOW  they kindly took it back and brought me a version with no sugar or honey and the oats were less cooked. END
BEGIN NOW  Mocha:- pleasant but massive(full size tall  glass) too sweet, suspect they use the chocolate syrup as couldn't taste much cocoa. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all pretty consistent with other American breakfast places I've been to above average atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be making my own breakfast until I discover a decent place. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here a second time for dinner instead of brunch this time. END
BEGIN NOW  DRINKS- Plaid on plaid drink was so good! Love those egg white drinks, and they do it well here. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD- Tried their famous fried chicken, and it was soooo juicy!! I was surprised. END
BEGIN NOW   Just wish there were more vegetables since they only gave 2 pieces of asparagus with 2 giant fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW  ATMOSPHERE- modern, restaurant is small inside, so we sat outside which was quite nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Lively neighborhood to grab dinner at. END
BEGIN NOW  OVERALL- Awesome restaurant!. END
BEGIN NOW  Sorry to be late in posting this. END
BEGIN NOW  life gets in the way, especially when one is remodeling [smile]. END
BEGIN NOW  After a lovely 2014 Holiday Series dinner, the 2015 Holiday Series dinner, which essentially promised the same menu of various goose dishes, was a real letdown. END
BEGIN NOW   Cost-cutting undermined  the once-lovely appetizer plate, which had a similar trio of dishes but was less generous,less interesting, and more green salad than anything else. END
BEGIN NOW  Entree dish was salty (confit; insufficiently rinsed) and greasy (potatoes). END
BEGIN NOW   The breast meat was chewy even tho sliced thin, and a touch overseasoned with thyme. END
BEGIN NOW   Grilled escarole was a nice bitter element but the plate was surprisingly dull-looking, especially compared to prior year's plate where bright Fuyu persimmons provided a lovely accent in both color and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopscotch's dessert menu is annoyingly banal. END
BEGIN NOW   In an area filled with great pastry chefs, offering mud pie or donuts is disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW   We tried the latter, which were dull and served with a too-sweet butterscotch cream. END
BEGIN NOW   It has no depth, and since the donuts are just fried dough, a little something more interesting is needed than just additional sugar on top of grease and flour. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall: a big miss which left us sad. END
BEGIN NOW   Itani's one of Oakland's premier groundbreaking chefs, but we're finding better food elsewhere these days. END
BEGIN NOW  Meat-heavy, drink-heavy. END
BEGIN NOW   Despite diner decor, this is for people who know little about food. END
BEGIN NOW   Mel's in SF makes this place look sick. END
BEGIN NOW   Thunderously noisy, even though there's not many tables. END
BEGIN NOW  - Fish'n'chips. END
BEGIN NOW   Travesty. END
BEGIN NOW   Little pieces of heavily battered fish. END
BEGIN NOW   Much vaunted duck fat chips are a waste of $2. END
BEGIN NOW   There are many places where duck fat fries are worth the upcharge. END
BEGIN NOW  Hopscotch is not one of them. END
BEGIN NOW   The three of us compared them head-to-head with the regular fries, and found very, very, very scant difference. END
BEGIN NOW   Both regular and duck fat were slightly too greasy; we like our chips a bit crisper. END
BEGIN NOW  - Fried chicken was a fried disaster. END
BEGIN NOW   The batter was the extra-crispy style, which Spouse dislikes, and was fried so hard and so long that even the dark meat was dried out. END
BEGIN NOW   It also had the dessicated look of fried food that had been sitting around, although he said it was very hot all the way through. END
BEGIN NOW   He did like the raw pickled cauliflower florets with it, however. END
BEGIN NOW  - Burger with tongue & the pork belly extra. END
BEGIN NOW   Burger unsalted (big NO-NO) and didn't cover the bun. END
BEGIN NOW   Slice of tongue was super-tiny and dried out. END
BEGIN NOW   Pork belly griddled so it was just chewy thick bacon, much ado about nothing. END
BEGIN NOW   The bun was good, but buttered before grilling, making it greasy. END
BEGIN NOW   Adding mayo and aioli just made it even greasier. END
BEGIN NOW   Ordered medium-rare, but came medium. END
BEGIN NOW   No option for cheese, highly irritating because this puppy needed some salt (and I don't often say that, being on 20 yrs of low-salt diet!). END
BEGIN NOW   Needed a whole lot more of those pickled onions to get any flavor through all the oil slick. END
BEGIN NOW  Iced tea was a very strange black tea/sassafras blend. END
BEGIN NOW   Does anybody seriously think weak flat root beer flavoring makes good iced tea???  But the ginger limeade was superb. END
BEGIN NOW   By itself, however, one good juice drink isn't enough to be worth the schlep out here. END
BEGIN NOW  Try Spice Monkey for fish'n'chips, Pican or Bistro 1491 for fried chicken, and anywhere else for a burger. END
BEGIN NOW  If only yelp allowed half stars, 3. END
BEGIN NOW  5 would be my true rating. END
BEGIN NOW  Service. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for lunch with a friend on a Friday afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW   Love the ambience. END
BEGIN NOW   Small, cozy space. END
BEGIN NOW   Restaurant was slow. END
BEGIN NOW   Walked in. END
BEGIN NOW   No hostess. END
BEGIN NOW   Then she appeared behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Attended to a customer who had a takeout order, but neglected to greet us afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW   Had to approach her to ask, "Do we seat ourselves?". END
BEGIN NOW   Unenthusiastically, she responded, "No, I will. END
BEGIN NOW  " Half star ticked right off for that!. END
BEGIN NOW  The server was friendly, but not overbearing. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't stand when a waiter asks you five times in 10 min intervals, "How is everything?". END
BEGIN NOW  There is outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant and they are dog friendly, yay!! My friend asked the server for some chicken for the dog and (although it took a while. END
BEGIN NOW  ) he came back with perfectly grilled slices of chicken (4 bucks a breast). END
BEGIN NOW   The food came out in a timely manner, but our additional order of the two Yonsei Oysters were lagging and we even thought that that it might have been forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW   There were only three other tables at this time. END
BEGIN NOW   Another half star ticked off!. END
BEGIN NOW  Food. END
BEGIN NOW  Start-Little Green Salad with butter lettuce, baby kale, (shaved) celery, hazelnuts, soft sheeps cheese, Sherry vinaigrette: (warning: it's truly starter size and takes four full bites to eat. END
BEGIN NOW  ) Some bites were overly salted and others under. END
BEGIN NOW   The sheeps cheese was the star. END
BEGIN NOW   Greens were crisp and can't hate on those toasted hazelnuts. END
BEGIN NOW   Last half star ticked off for this one!. END
BEGIN NOW  Main-Buttermilk Fried Chicken with black sesame asparagus: DAMN, that crusty, crunchy, flakey, party in yo mouth chicken skin. END
BEGIN NOW   Tell me your secrets! It's a GIANT chicken drumstick+thigh. END
BEGIN NOW   The meat itself was well cooked over a bed of cabbage slaw. END
BEGIN NOW   Finally, topped with two grilled asparagus (keepin those expectations realistic!). END
BEGIN NOW   Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but pretty darn good. END
BEGIN NOW  Side-Yonsei Oysters with sea urchin, salmon roe and citrus: Real fresh ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW   These were the good ones. END
BEGIN NOW   Little sweet oysters. END
BEGIN NOW   Gotta love that sea brine. END
BEGIN NOW   More citrus than soy, but how can you go wrong that roe and sea urchin??! A dozen more please!. END
BEGIN NOW  I really wanted to like this place for brunch but only had an ok experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Warning:. END
BEGIN NOW  -Coffee was/is terrible! Sorry but it's either the beans you're using, lack of extraction when brewing or maybe the coffee machine needs to be decalcify. END
BEGIN NOW  We asked for another cup with a new pot and tasted just as bad. END
BEGIN NOW  -Place gets heated up fast. END
BEGIN NOW   Seems like no AC so expect to sweat on a warm day. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't imagine in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW  Now to food. END
BEGIN NOW  1. END
BEGIN NOW   Buttermilk fried chicken - crispy, juicy, fresh and hot. END
BEGIN NOW   Chicken and gravy were the best part of my brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   However, biscuit was hard and chewy. END
BEGIN NOW   Side of fruits tasted sour and old :( Also no choice on how you want your eggs when you order this dish. END
BEGIN NOW   Only scrambled. END
BEGIN NOW  2. END
BEGIN NOW   Mushroom Benedict - lacks flavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Need a lil truffle oil or something to enhance the shiitake mushrooms and need to reduce the cream on the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  3. END
BEGIN NOW   Donuts - good but really small for the portion. END
BEGIN NOW  only 3 mini round donuts. END
BEGIN NOW   Gotta split the 3rd :/. END
BEGIN NOW  Honestly don't know if I'll try this place again. END
BEGIN NOW   Tempted to go back and order the Benedict with pork belly but not sure I can convince the BF to give it another shot. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a cute, trendy spot in Uptown Oakland where customers ranging from college students to older, more mature patrons come to dine. END
BEGIN NOW   It is a tiny restaurant, but there is seating both inside and outside, and the decorations are spot-on. END
BEGIN NOW   The menu changes for lunch and dinner, and are limited to about 5-7 offerings, and is on the pricey side. END
BEGIN NOW  I came here once for brunch and another time for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW  My favorite is the yonsei oysters, which includes salmon roe and uni on the half shell, a perfect Asian fusion dish. END
BEGIN NOW   They taste fresh and complex. END
BEGIN NOW   One second you taste the salty juices of the roe, then you taste the sweet briny freshness of the uni, followed by the cool ocean flavor of the oysters. END
BEGIN NOW   The portions are a bit small but they are definitely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  For brunch, I had the braised pork belly benedict. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork belly was cooked perfectly, crunchy and tender at the right places. END
BEGIN NOW   The hollandaise sauce was the right amount of creamy and citrusy. END
BEGIN NOW   I liked that it was a well-executed twist on a classic brunch platter. END
BEGIN NOW  However, I did not like the dinner dishes as much. END
BEGIN NOW   They seemed a bit too average for the price you pay. END
BEGIN NOW   Granted, I'm sure they use the most high quality and the freshest ingredients, but at $19 for a plate of pasta and $22 for clams, I sort of expect something out of this world. END
BEGIN NOW  The soba bucatini is very tomatoey but tastes just a bit better than the average pasta, though the green beans do add a nice crunch. END
BEGIN NOW   The manila clams were yummy and it came with a deep-fried vegetable that paired well with the seafood tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   However, I felt the prices were too high for what my bf and I got. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, this is a nice little date spot, but much more so for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a bar and serve all types of alcohol, so it's great for boozey brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Any chance to try a new brunch place is gladly taken - #brunchsohard! We heard this place has a better brunch menu than dinner. END
BEGIN NOW   They have a very small location but there's apparently more seating next door! You can make reservations too, so definitely plan ahead. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything on their menu was tempting - American brunch fare with a Korean twist, what better combination could there be!? I just had to go for the kimchee fried rice with shoyu eggs and pork belly. END
BEGIN NOW   Tender, flavorful, spicy and sweet. END
BEGIN NOW  every bite was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   We also got to try the donuts with butterscotch cream (it should be a sin to have this for breakfast) and the cinnamon challah toast with jam (how is this so soft?!). END
BEGIN NOW   I had a bite of their famous fried chicken and biscuits for whatever room was left in my stomach and wow it was not your typical chicken and biscuits!. END
BEGIN NOW  Based on my experience today, you will not be disappointed no matter what you order. END
BEGIN NOW   Wish we had this place closer to home. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd be ordering that kimchee fried rice on a weekly basis. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with a Yonsei Oyster and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken--both were good, but both items are way overpriced which disallows me from giving this place anymore than 3 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything else about the experience here was outstanding except the $23 chicken that didn't even come with a carb on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   That dish is worth $13-$15 at most. END
BEGIN NOW   It was literally just some fried chicken (sure, dredged in their signature marinade of buttermilk, soy sauce, and potato starch), some asparagus, and chrysanthemum salad with vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW   The chicken was juicy and tasty but it wasn't even a decent size--was still hungry after. END
BEGIN NOW   You can argue that this one dish alone isn't supposed to fill you up however I think that the very essence of fried chicken is a comfort food that serves the purpose of filling you up and if someone wants to make it extra special, he/she can do that, but he/she doesn't need to make it so fancy it becomes small and too expensive. END
BEGIN NOW   It's fried chicken, how much extra does your buttermilk and soy sauce cost? This isn't Napa where you're surrounded by million dollar wineries. END
BEGIN NOW   I can understand overpriced oysters, but $23 fried chicken in Oakland? You've got to be kidding me. END
BEGIN NOW  Since I wasn't fully satisfied, I had to go to Belly down the street which is where I should've went to in the first place. END
BEGIN NOW   Literally, if they just added something like mashed or scalloped potatoes, this dish would be on point. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not sure why everyone raves about it. END
BEGIN NOW   Furthermore, I've never complained about negative space on a dish but even from the consumer point of view, the dish didn't come together well looks-wise. END
BEGIN NOW   It'll leave you hanging like, "where's the rest of my food?" The oyster was pretty delicious, but not worth $5. END
BEGIN NOW  So, I honestly would recommend checking out Hopscotch and I want to come back someday to give it another try, but please do yourself a favor and refrain from ordering that fried chicken--you're better off going to 'insert-your-favorite-fast-food-fried-chicken-joint here'. END
BEGIN NOW  On a positive note, the staff was very friendly and it's a cozy unique atmosphere that defines the rising Oakland food scene. END
BEGIN NOW   I believe it might be best to make reservations if you're anticipating to come with friends during peak eating times. END
BEGIN NOW  I have to say Hopscotch has a pretty delicious brunch! This was my first time brunching in Oakland as opposed to SF, and it was pretty positive overall. END
BEGIN NOW   The setup of the restaurant is a little confusing, as there are two separate rooms separated by a convenience store in the middle. END
BEGIN NOW   We dined in the second room, which I actually thought had a nicer and more spacious layout. END
BEGIN NOW  We started off the meal with some mimosas and the Donuts and Butterscotch Cream. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely try these because they're super warm and fluffy, and the butterscotch is so good you'll literally want to bottle it and take it home! We decided to split a couple of the entrees, so we ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Biscuits, which had a really tasty gravy drizzled on top. END
BEGIN NOW   The biscuit was nice and flaky and you can tell it's homemade. END
BEGIN NOW   We also got the Kimchee Fried Rice with pork belly, which was the standout of the meal for me. END
BEGIN NOW   The rice was really authentic, and I loved the addition of the jidori eggs!. END
BEGIN NOW  I've heard Hopscotch also has a delicious dinner menu, so I'd definitely come back to check it out!. END
BEGIN NOW  The combination of Beer (hops) and Scotch is already awesome but add gastro pub grub and you have the makings of a winner! The place is split into two separate rooms that are surrounding some other business so that's a bit strange at first. END
BEGIN NOW   The main room where the hostess is located is quite small and I was wondering if we were going to fit. END
BEGIN NOW   After a very short walk to their "annex" as they called it, we were pleased to find more larger tables and room for our party of four. END
BEGIN NOW   Both rooms were sparsely decorated and appeared that the building was from the early 1900s, it had a cozy feel. END
BEGIN NOW  I had to start with a Hop / Scotch Pairing. END
BEGIN NOW   I went with the Nikka Coffee Whiskey paired with Fort Point Charred Manzanita Red Ale ($14). END
BEGIN NOW   The Scotch was served neat with both water and ice on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   I popped a single rock into the scotch to open it up a bit and proceeded to sip back and forth off the two enjoying how the flavors played off each other in harmony. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu is spartan with only 5 entree offerings and 6 starter options. END
BEGIN NOW   My wife had the ribs and I got to try one, they were quite good. END
BEGIN NOW   They were tender but not too tender, seasoned well and served with Japanese Sweet Potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the "First Base" Burger. END
BEGIN NOW   It was a blend of house ground chuck and beef tongue. END
BEGIN NOW   Now beef tongue is not usually something I seek out but I was feeling adventurous. END
BEGIN NOW   I took a chance and ordered it medium rare on the waitresses suggestion and unfortunately is came out about as rare as I've ever seen a burger. END
BEGIN NOW   I still ate it and it was tasty but I learned my lesson, medium for burgers, medium rare for steaks. END
BEGIN NOW   I added the house cured bacon and some cheddar cheese to my burger and that put it @ $20. END
BEGIN NOW   The $20 burger was served with some house made kennebec potato chips, it would have cost $4 more to substitute fries. END
BEGIN NOW  Price was my major gripe at this place (besides the uber rare meat), our bill was over $60 for the 2 of us and I had a burger! I'm not from the area so when I come back to town I will likely not return but it's worth trying at least once. END
BEGIN NOW  First time here for brunch, heard it was good but no expectations. END
BEGIN NOW   We started with the Wasabi Bloody Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not a big Bloody Mary person but these totally hit the spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Just the right level of heat and spice. END
BEGIN NOW  Then the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW   You know when you have a bite of food and everyone goes quiet and looks at each other? Especially with a group that is usually not quiet? And then the conversation shifts to "What would be your last meal?" because the plate in front of you is now in the running? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   Get the donuts. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh God and then the main course. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the fried chicken with the sausage gravy on the side, poached eggs, biscuit and (mostly decorative) fruit and salad. END
BEGIN NOW   This is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW   And the gravy with the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW   Ugh. END
BEGIN NOW   I am still thinking about it 3 days later. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   Took a while to get our food, especially considering the place was mostly empty on a late Saturday afternoon, but I guess you can't rush perfection. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW  Any bar/restaurant that offers happy hour on a Saturday has a very, very special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW   Especially when their happy hour menu includes $7 cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Our bartender made the most amazing whiskey sours - he put egg white in them, so they were frothy and almost creamy. END
BEGIN NOW  The food is ah-mazing too. END
BEGIN NOW   Holy crap, this is a f*cking good hamburger. END
BEGIN NOW   The patty is so, so juicy and you can really taste that it's freshly made because the meat just crumbles in juicy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW   Fries are thick and soft and they give you this tangy orange aioli to dip them in. END
BEGIN NOW   It paired reallllly well with our whiskey sours. END
BEGIN NOW  The ambiance is old-timey and incredibly charming. END
BEGIN NOW   Hopscotch has a second, disconnected room over from Subway (can we just get rid of the Subway?!) that we were seated in. END
BEGIN NOW   One entire wall is a cream-colored tufted leather booth. END
BEGIN NOW   It feels like something out of the golden age of jazz. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is remarkably friendly and made for a very comfortable experience. END
BEGIN NOW   Love love love Hopscotch. END
BEGIN NOW  Oh hey, you can get a bucket of fried chicken to-go too :). END
BEGIN NOW  A friend who knows I like fried chicken said I had to come here and try their buttermilk fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    $18 for half a chicken, she said. END
BEGIN NOW    At those prices, it'd better be some chicken, I said. END
BEGIN NOW  In the first place, it isn't half a chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    (To be fair to the restaurant, they don't say it is. END
BEGIN NOW  )  It's two pieces, a boneless breast and a drumstick (not boneless), sort of melded together with a bridge of excess breading. END
BEGIN NOW    When it was served, I was told "the only bone is in the drumstick", which suggested that there might be at least a boneless thigh or a boneless wing in there somewhere, but there wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW  The breading was very crunchy and very thick. END
BEGIN NOW    It had an interesting seasoning, that was its best point. END
BEGIN NOW    It was quite tolerable with the thick, not particularly moist breast meat. END
BEGIN NOW    Once I'd eaten that, though, the breading became overwhelming, and I was glad there wasn't any more. END
BEGIN NOW  After leaving here, I drove up Telegraph and went past a Church's, and I thought: I could have gotten twice as much fried chicken, just as good and with less heavy breading, for half as much money, if I'd gone here instead. END
BEGIN NOW  One of the rare times my wife and I agreed that a restaurant was 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the burger. END
BEGIN NOW   It was perfectly done, juicy, and tasted amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   One of the best burgers I've had. END
BEGIN NOW   It was worth the $14. END
BEGIN NOW  My wife had the ribs, which she loved. END
BEGIN NOW   The meat came off the bone very easily, and the sauce was quite flavorful (and a bit smokey, which she liked). END
BEGIN NOW   She was also very happy with the cocktail she had (an interesting tropical and smokey flavor combo). END
BEGIN NOW  We also really enjoyed the mud pie. END
BEGIN NOW  No complaints!. END
BEGIN NOW  Food to die for and a counter to die at. END
BEGIN NOW  Brunch could be wonderful, but you can't eat comfortably at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW   The stools have no foot rest and you get a climbing Halfdome experience clinging to the 2 inch rail the provide. END
BEGIN NOW  NOTE TO READER: Before I get my head chopped off by other yelpers. END
BEGIN NOW   (This has happened before) I am about to go on a 14 hour flight, out of the country. END
BEGIN NOW   During this flight I have nothing to do and I know I have slacked on my reviewing because I have been crazy busy! Although every time I have gone somewhere new I made it a point to check-in so I may go back and review later. END
BEGIN NOW   It has taken me a while to review these restaurants but I am finally doing so. END
BEGIN NOW   Before somebody says "you posted x9843058048 reviews in one day", please know that I am reviewing as my flight is in the air and will be posting once landed at my destination. END
BEGIN NOW   Thank you! Also, I review on trip advisor before anybody goes psycho crazy on me saying they seen this review elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW   I post on both yelp and trip advisor of my reviews! Thank you (:. END
BEGIN NOW  Location: Downtown Oakland, street parking!. END
BEGIN NOW  Customer Service: Fast and welcoming!. END
BEGIN NOW  Decor: Small restaurant but cutesy atmosphere, we sat at the table top seating where the small bar is at. END
BEGIN NOW  Presentation of Food: ---. END
BEGIN NOW  How did the food taste?: FIRST BASE BURGER WITH GRIDDLED BEEF TONGUE. END
BEGIN NOW   That's all I have to say. END
BEGIN NOW   AMAZING. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall Experience: Good!. END
BEGIN NOW  Would I Come Back?: Yes!! Hell Yes!. END
BEGIN NOW  When my daughter flew in from Orlando, she was hungry. END
BEGIN NOW    So, we decided to eat something small. END
BEGIN NOW    Hence, we came to Oakland Grill. END
BEGIN NOW    We were here a few times, but I never got a chance to write a review until now. END
BEGIN NOW  We ordered the waffle with 2 eggs, and 2 bacons. END
BEGIN NOW    When they brought the plate, it was a large portion. END
BEGIN NOW    Good side for 2 people. END
BEGIN NOW    My daughter and I shared a plate. END
BEGIN NOW  The food wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW    Can't really go wrong with breakfast, unless it's Dennys. END
BEGIN NOW    For the most part, it was good. END
BEGIN NOW    I like their service. END
BEGIN NOW    Very friendly service. END
BEGIN NOW    The ambience wasn't too bad. END
BEGIN NOW    It can get very busy during the weekends. END
BEGIN NOW    Be prepare for it. END
BEGIN NOW  Rating:. END
BEGIN NOW  Food:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Service:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Price:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Ambience:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall:  4. END
BEGIN NOW  I would come back over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW  We got lucky with parking for a Sunday but we did look for around 10 mins. END
BEGIN NOW  Wait was super quick for a Sunday at 11:30, the guy who seated us was awesome!. END
BEGIN NOW  Get to a cute table, given menus. END
BEGIN NOW  Waitress comes and is stank in the face, I can tell this will be fun, no hello, no nothing, just :. END
BEGIN NOW  "What would you like? ". END
BEGIN NOW  The food was expensive for what it is but hey that's trendy Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  I would have at least had an egg that was cooked to order. END
BEGIN NOW   ( picture added ). END
BEGIN NOW  I got attitude for being allergic to pineapple, had no idea pancakes come with a side of fruit as it's not mentioned on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm sad! My boyfriend loves Eggs Benny and his would have been really easy place to help him get his fix. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes! Family could not stop telling me about the crab cakes, and they were delicious. END
BEGIN NOW    Serving size here is stupendous. END
BEGIN NOW    Staff here is really nice, and our waitress was so attentive. END
BEGIN NOW  We split the crab cake benedict and pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW    The apple sausage is worth trying. END
BEGIN NOW  I love a breakfast place like this. END
BEGIN NOW    The atmosphere is just relaxed and warm. END
BEGIN NOW  I came with a bigger group of 6 and had about a 25 minute wait which is a lot faster than I thought it would be considering the large crowd of people standing outside of the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the chef's eggs Benedict which I was really excited about from the reviews, but sadly it just fell short. END
BEGIN NOW   The eggs itself were cooked perfectly and the side potatoes were well seasoned and quite tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Aside from that everything else was quite disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW   The sausage wasn't very tasty and the sauce was too overpowering and made the toasted English muffin soggy and hard to cut through. END
BEGIN NOW   Though I was starving coming in I barely could finish half the meal. END
BEGIN NOW  Taking a bite of the cob salad, I wish I would have gotten that because the crispy bacon and the fresh lettuce mixed with the well seasoned chicken (which was a hair dry) was worlds better than what I had. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, aside from the great customer service this place was just meh and I probably would check out another breakfast place next time. END
BEGIN NOW  GREAT BRUNCH SPOT! Generous portions, and their potato hash is bomb! It has a subtle spiciness to it. END
BEGIN NOW   The side of potatoes comes with your entree, or it's 3. END
BEGIN NOW  99$ as a side. END
BEGIN NOW   We ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict, which was on their special. END
BEGIN NOW   It had heaping servings of crab, a great creamy hollandaise sauce on top and a great portion of potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   For 1. END
BEGIN NOW  99$, you can substitute your toast with a pancake. END
BEGIN NOW  We also ordered the turkey/avocado/bacon Benedict, also on their special. END
BEGIN NOW   The combo was amazing and the poached egg was nice & drippy when I poked into it. END
BEGIN NOW  Great spot, service was friendly & atmosphere was inviting. END
BEGIN NOW   Will definitely come back !. END
BEGIN NOW  Jack London Square was fairly empty on Monday around 11:30 am. END
BEGIN NOW   Assuming that it was a weekday and no one around, we thought the Oakland Grill wouldn't have much people. END
BEGIN NOW   But I guess everyone that didn't have work also decided to go to Oakland grill. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty packed, we came in and snagged the last table. END
BEGIN NOW  CRAB CAKE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW  99. END
BEGIN NOW  SUPER FRIED. END
BEGIN NOW   but it was so good. END
BEGIN NOW   [Crab cake+Poached egg + hollandaise sauce+English muffin]. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend preferred the blackstone Benedict, he said the crab and was too heavy and too fried for him. END
BEGIN NOW   All of the benedicts come with seasoned potatoes with a dollop of sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW   I Put the sour cream on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   Also comes with two small slices of fruit. END
BEGIN NOW  BLACKSTONE BENEDICT: $12. END
BEGIN NOW  99. END
BEGIN NOW  [bacon+tomato+hollandaise sauce+English muffin] totally preferred the crab cake. END
BEGIN NOW   The way they made the eggs though wasn't as runny as we all thought it would be. END
BEGIN NOW   This one was okay to me, but my friends loved this one way more. END
BEGIN NOW  STRAWBERRY MIMOSA: $3. END
BEGIN NOW  99. END
BEGIN NOW  Pretty small glass. END
BEGIN NOW   I totally thought it was strawberry + mimosa (OJ + Champagne) but it was actually strawberry + champagne. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Wish the flavor was more crispy C like a chilled glass or something. END
BEGIN NOW  ORANGE JUICE: $4. END
BEGIN NOW  50. END
BEGIN NOW  Freshly squeezed. END
BEGIN NOW   No pulp. END
BEGIN NOW   A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW   Small glass. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely a good find. END
BEGIN NOW   Would come again. END
BEGIN NOW   Has the ambience of a Denny's diner. END
BEGIN NOW   Also has an upstairs for dining. END
BEGIN NOW  This was a cool little place my work group visited while out on a team building trip. END
BEGIN NOW   The location is in an area where there's a lot of wholesale produce traffic, so be forewarned that not only is parking bad, but be mindful of fast moving forklifts hauling produce. END
BEGIN NOW  The restaurant has a lot of charm. END
BEGIN NOW   The kind of charm that says "established" and unpretentious. END
BEGIN NOW    My coworker set up the whole affair and had their staff arrange a large table for us. END
BEGIN NOW   While a few of my coworkers were late, they cheerfully filled our water glasses and coffee mugs without rushing us or giving us the impatient looks. END
BEGIN NOW   Granted it wasn't busy, but you all have been there. END
BEGIN NOW  After having four cups of coffee, I had the applewood smoked sausage with eggs and hash browns. END
BEGIN NOW   It was quite filling and I only finished about more than half. END
BEGIN NOW   In my opinion the apple sausage was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but was still pretty tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   There was a heaping portion of hash browns which was done right and not swimming in oil. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was really good, they really took good care of us. END
BEGIN NOW  I seriously doubt I'll venture here again as it's pretty far from where I live and parking is typical Oakland, but if someone invited me, I'd cheerfully meet them there. END
BEGIN NOW  Lipstick stains on my coffee cup, potatoes didn't have the sour cream I asked for, an item that was not mine was added to my bill, and the poached egg on my benedict was fully cooked and didn't run at all! That's the whole point of the benedict! All of this and I couldn't even find my server to ask for these things to be fixed until my date was finished with their food. END
BEGIN NOW   Super bummer. END
BEGIN NOW   The only reason I gave a second star was that I've been here before and had a better experience. END
BEGIN NOW   This was pretty disappointing though. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland Grill will definitely satisfy your breakfast needs for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    Located in downtown Oakland, it serves breakfast all day for those late risers. END
BEGIN NOW  I went with the Lox Benedict (smoked salmon) with a side of potatoes and a few strawberry mimosas. END
BEGIN NOW    It was tasty, hearty, and the portion was huge. END
BEGIN NOW   The mimosas was mostly champagne, so don't worry about being skimped. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   The only downside is my smoked salmon was topped with warm hollandaise sauce that lightly cooked the salmon (I like mine raw). END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe I should've ordered it on the side next time. END
BEGIN NOW  Go with the Benedict, they're most popular dish. END
BEGIN NOW  Oakland Grill is my solution to my Jersey diner. END
BEGIN NOW  * They serve their menu all day (yes, breakfast anytime), they're pretty much always busy on the weekends, the food is hearty and reasonably priced. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been both for weekday lunch and a Sunday brunch and both did not disappoint. END
BEGIN NOW   Lunch was much calmer; we walked right in like we owned the place. END
BEGIN NOW   My chicken and black beans was so large, I failed to clean my plate. END
BEGIN NOW   It was also healthy (yay!), filled with grilled chicken, black beans, fresh salsa, corn tortillas, a side salad and what seemed to be a half avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   It's so nice to be able to order fresh food at a casual eatery like this. END
BEGIN NOW  This past weekend's meal wasn't quite so healthy. END
BEGIN NOW   I indulged in the veggie benedict with hollandaise on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   Not the most adventurous order, but definitely a solid one! The perfectly poached eggs topped on an english muffin with grilled tomatoes and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   My one complaint? I think they could step it up on their english muffin game. END
BEGIN NOW   Change it up maybe? Higher quality muffins? Still wonderful, but it could have used a lil' something. END
BEGIN NOW  Most breakfasts come with what seems to be a pound of breakfast potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   Although the b'fast potatoes are solid, I prefer mine extra crispy (which I'll request for next time), as these were a bit more mushy. END
BEGIN NOW   The fresh fruit slices are such a great touch and this fruit was perfectly ripe!. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee is dece, nothing gourmet and I spied a strawberry mimosa that was going like hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is on point with water glasses always filled and quick service. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, a solid neighborhood joint. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure if I'd wait an hour to grub, but definitely worth a 20 minute wait as the direct 'hood can be a bit sparse for brunching options, especially on a Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW  * There are more diners per capita in Jersey than anywhere else in the world! Boo ya! #Themoreyouknow. END
BEGIN NOW  Decent neighborhood establishment with all the usual items you'd expect for brunch, whether omelets, scrambles, benedicts, and other egg-heavy dishes; or lunch, such as salads, sandwiches, and burgers. END
BEGIN NOW   Anything you can get here is going to be pretty dependable and well-portioned for the price. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is reasonably friendly too. END
BEGIN NOW   Overall, a perfectly decent experience that might not pack a lot of "wow" punches but is nevertheless dependable. END
BEGIN NOW  Stopped in here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and it was pretty packed but they seated us within 5 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   We ordered the eggs vocal stone which was like an eggs Benedict but with bacon and tomatoes instead of Canadian bacon. END
BEGIN NOW   The hollandaise sauce was amazing and so were the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   My fiancé also had a pancake which was super fluffy and the portions were great. END
BEGIN NOW   Would definitely eat here again. END
BEGIN NOW  One of my favorite brunch spots! Especially since they serve breakfast ALL DAY!. END
BEGIN NOW  Its usually busy but you get seat right away almost all the time! Once you walk in, always get greeted by someone who's working. END
BEGIN NOW  I usually order the Eggs Benedict and you always get a choice to have fruits or potatoes on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   They always have the freshest fruits available and if you have a specific fruit you only want, they will be happy to accommodate you. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried the potatoes too and they were equally delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  The server always comes  by to fill your water cup without you having to ask. END
BEGIN NOW   They constantly come by to check up on your table. END
BEGIN NOW   Everyone is always extremely friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  My favourite brunch spot in Oakland hands down. END
BEGIN NOW   Recommended by my grandma who would frequently come here during her conferences back in the day and whose advice I take to heart. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm a creature of habit so I always order the crab cake Benedict. END
BEGIN NOW  loved it the first time and every time since. END
BEGIN NOW   Their food is Always bomb and just made with lots love. END
BEGIN NOW  The spot is hidden, near a produce area, lots of parking outside. END
BEGIN NOW   It has 2 levels, downstairs with booths or upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW   Excellent cooks behind those grills, and friendly servers. END
BEGIN NOW   A must whilst in Oakland!!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is in such a hidden area (near all the meat packaging/wholesale warehouses). END
BEGIN NOW   I love it regardless though!. END
BEGIN NOW  FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW  I got one of the Benedict and can't remember which one but I've never been a fan of crab cake or ham so I asked if I could replace it with a sausage patty and they were able to accommodate me! The one thing I look forward to in eating eggs benedict is the yolk that comes out of it, and for both my visits the yolk came gushing out, YES!. END
BEGIN NOW  SERVICE:. END
BEGIN NOW  The servers have always been super nice. END
BEGIN NOW   I've never had a bad encounter with any of them. END
BEGIN NOW   Super friendly, and I'm glad they're able to substitute. END
BEGIN NOW  PARKING:. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking is on the street, & it is meter parking, unless you park like 2 blocks away for 2 hour free parking. END
BEGIN NOW  Delicious eggs benedict and $3 mimosas? Yes please!. END
BEGIN NOW  Arrived here for the usual Sunday brunch ritual after getting frustrated and not finding any bottomless mimosa spots that served past 2 pm. END
BEGIN NOW   We settled for this spot when we noticed how nicely priced their mimosas were. END
BEGIN NOW   It was of course incredibly busy since it was Sunday brunch hours and but we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW   Our server was incredibly kind and it being our first time was very information and willingly gave us her recommendations. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend went with the burger and I opted for the eggs benedict after eyeing it up at our neighbor's table. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm sure the crab benedict is the more popular option, but oddly enough I'm not the biggest fan of crab. END
BEGIN NOW   Two rounds of mimosas in and our food arrived. END
BEGIN NOW   It looked AMAZING first off, and the taste matched its appearances. END
BEGIN NOW   The eggs were basically orgasmic. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfectly cooked and explosive with all that delicious yolk. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes that came on the side were freaking delicious as well! So packed full of different type of herbs, flavors, and you can tell that the cooks had scraped all of the good stuff off of the pan (hey, that's where all the flavor is, right?) to garnish the potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW   I was in heaven, and so incredibly happy by the time the meal was done. END
BEGIN NOW  I do wish they had bottomless mimosas and chicken and waffles, but those are just my own selfish desires. END
BEGIN NOW   Other than that, I will certainly return!. END
BEGIN NOW  Great everything!  Seriously. END
BEGIN NOW    I had never tried Red Bay Coffee before this- two thumbs up!  Plus it's roasted in Oakland- I love that!. END
BEGIN NOW  I first tried the oatmeal and went for sweet- adding bananas, brown sugar and yogurt. END
BEGIN NOW    Delicious!  However, the polenta- oh the polenta!  I get it with caramelized red onions, fresh green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and sea salt. END
BEGIN NOW    Filling, nutritious and absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW  It was all so good that I had to go back and try their donut happy hour- HOLY COW!!. END
BEGIN NOW  Top that all off with a fantastic mission- " job creation and leadership training for girls in Oakland who face significant barriers to employment," this is definitely a favorite spot now. END
BEGIN NOW    I highly recommend it. END
BEGIN NOW  Mamacitas Cafe is small, just a serving counter on the left. END
BEGIN NOW   and some lounge seats to the right. END
BEGIN NOW  another room has tables for laptopers. END
BEGIN NOW   not sure if it's connected to the Cafe or not. END
BEGIN NOW  eats: oats or polenta(grits)  choose polenta (12 oz 6. END
BEGIN NOW  95). END
BEGIN NOW  -choice of many toppings and seasonings. END
BEGIN NOW  -roasted tomatos, zuchinni, sea salt, green onions was my choices. END
BEGIN NOW  -delicious! never thought i would like grits. END
BEGIN NOW  brew: red bay coffee (3). END
BEGIN NOW  -bold, herby taste. END
BEGIN NOW  -definitely unique. END
BEGIN NOW  drips:. END
BEGIN NOW  -parking difficult in this area. END
BEGIN NOW  -quick service with smiles. END
BEGIN NOW  -menu limited to 2 offerings, maybe more in the morning?. END
BEGIN NOW  In a world overrun with Starbucks, Peet's and Keurig machines that you have to decalcify every 2 minutes (you don't know my struggle so you don't feel my hustle!), a good cup of coffee has become a luxury that too many of us don't get too experience often enough. END
BEGIN NOW   But look no further! Sip on without the shame of knowing your joe was sourced by underpaid laborers and upheld by unfair labor practices! Dunk a delicious donut hole in that cup and know that pastry was made with wholehearted love and passion by women who support fair business practices and use their small business to uplift their community!. END
BEGIN NOW  I love everything about Mamacita's, and please believe that the coffee, lavender lemonade and yummy donut kebabs are just the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW   The owners, Shana and Renee, grind super hard for theirs and employ and educate young women in high school on the ins and outs of business ownership along the way by offering opportunities to keep kids occupied and focused. END
BEGIN NOW   They serve up Red Bay Coffee, keeping it fresh, local and delicious while giving back to the hood whenever they can. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't praise them enough!. END
BEGIN NOW  My fiancée and I first heard word of Mamacitas Café in the East Bay Express over the summer and appreciated their mission. END
BEGIN NOW   Then when looking for a vendor for our post-wedding picnic they came immediately to mind. END
BEGIN NOW   It was easy as pie to get in touch with them and then for a very fair price they served a lovely selection of their amazing donut kebabs to our assembled guests. END
BEGIN NOW  They were there on time, supplied all the gear they needed, and ran a well organized operation. END
BEGIN NOW  Both the sweet and savory options were a big hit, along with the hot coffee, iced coffee, iced tea, and lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW   I would recommend them to anyone looking for a dessert or coffee vendor. END
BEGIN NOW  I sat with a group of 4. END
BEGIN NOW   Everything was tasty and the service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW   They were more than accommodating for our 8 month son. END
BEGIN NOW  We shared a chicken and waffle, which was very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   The waffle reminds me of a doughnut and the chicken has a perfectly crispy battery. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the vegetable hash and everything was cooked just right: nothing soggy or greasy. END
BEGIN NOW   The red chile sauce was a great compliment to the greens. END
BEGIN NOW  Long wait. END
BEGIN NOW    That's to be expected though. END
BEGIN NOW  Coffee was good. END
BEGIN NOW  I had the waffle with fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW    The waffle was better than average but the chicken wasn't great. END
BEGIN NOW    They use chicken breast, which is indisputably the worst cut of meat on the bird. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a tasteless, fat-less cut. END
BEGIN NOW    There's a reason fried chicken joints serve legs and wings. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a mixed review regarding the food and the atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW    Had the Thursday before Memorial Day off and the choice of Oakland eateries were Mama's  Royal Cafe (a standard on any day of hookie) and Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW    So I choose to pay Auntie a visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Service: On point, coffee DELICIOUS!!!  Whatever the jam was. END
BEGIN NOW  YAASS!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  The not so great. END
BEGIN NOW   The noise level in this place is deafening. END
BEGIN NOW    It was about 11 am and not crowed, but steady. END
BEGIN NOW    Restaurants of today have zero noise cancellation and given the open space, closeness of the kitchen and lots of wood decor the sound is to the point of painful. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash with Poached Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW    I know my corned beef and this was a miss. END
BEGIN NOW    Very little meat and a whole lot of deconstructed cabbage and peppers. END
BEGIN NOW    Nothing was together. END
BEGIN NOW    It was like a tiny bit of meat topped with cabbage, onions, some potatoes and the topped with the eggs that were not poached well (running whites). END
BEGIN NOW    Homemade rye bread was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW  My last put off was this little note card that explained about the "surcharge". END
BEGIN NOW    Auntie charges a 15% surcharge to help pay for the entire staff. END
BEGIN NOW    You may also leave and additional amount that will go directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW    And like a good Aunt, she has broken down what the extra 3% or 5% for your server would be. END
BEGIN NOW    You read this coming into the restaurant, you read it again at the table and on your tab. END
BEGIN NOW  The cost of doing business is just that. END
BEGIN NOW    Whatever you have to pay to keep your place staffed well should be built into the cost of your meals, not let the patron work on supplementing your payroll. END
BEGIN NOW    What will we see next?  PG&E goes up on gas so there is another surcharge to read about if we want hot food or to see the food on the table?. END
BEGIN NOW  So, I will not return to Aunt Mary's, and I will instead go visit Mama's. END
BEGIN NOW  like everyone should. END
BEGIN NOW  We went here with an open mind, but was disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW   Food and service were WAY below average. END
BEGIN NOW   And what's up with this 15% mandatory tip? I don't buy this argument that since kitchen staff are making min wage then charge customers more to help the kitchen staff. END
BEGIN NOW   Really? If the owner really cares for his employees, why pay them min wage? Give them a raise man. END
BEGIN NOW   Don't ask customers to compensate for your lack of humanity. END
BEGIN NOW   Total BS. END
BEGIN NOW   We will never go back here and will not recommend it to anyone. END
BEGIN NOW  Now here are just 2 examples of the shortfalls regarding the food:. END
BEGIN NOW  (1) $15 for 2 hard pancakes with fake cherry jam. END
BEGIN NOW   Really? For the sake of comparison: Bette's diner has the BEST pancakes; price for 2 is $6. END
BEGIN NOW  75 (same size). END
BEGIN NOW   It comes with butter and syrup (and not attitude). END
BEGIN NOW   Who would pay twice as much money for lower quality food/service?. END
BEGIN NOW  (2) my poached eggs where raw yuk. END
BEGIN NOW   It's not very hard to make poached eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   Believe me, just Google it and you'll learn. END
BEGIN NOW  I think people who give this place 5 starts should really get out more often. END
BEGIN NOW   Try other breakfast places. END
BEGIN NOW   Any place is better than this (Yes even Denny's). END
BEGIN NOW   The entire experience was way below average. END
BEGIN NOW   The only bright side was my lovely company. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had Aunt Mary's bookmarked for sooo long it moved to a new location hahah! (Not far. END
BEGIN NOW  only a few blocks down!). END
BEGIN NOW  After my experience, I can see why so many people rave about it. END
BEGIN NOW   It's super casual with generous portions. END
BEGIN NOW   Prices are not cheap here, but you are paying for good quality dishes. END
BEGIN NOW   (Kid friendly too - there's toys and books in the waiting area). END
BEGIN NOW  Our party of 7 didn't have to wait long early on a Saturday morning (around 9am). END
BEGIN NOW   I put my name down at the front & was told they have a special room upstairs for large parties. END
BEGIN NOW   (I believe your party has to be complete before they will seat you though) We felt like VIPs since we had the whole space to ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW   There was even a bathroom upstairs and couches! KUDOS to our wonderful server to made the endless treks up and down the stairs bringing our food, clearing our plates, refilling our coffee, and checking on us periodically. END
BEGIN NOW  I really liked my Southern Bubble and Squeak dish (what a cool name :D) It's basically like gravy, eggs, and mashed potatoes. END
BEGIN NOW  simple enough but it was really tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Another memorable dish in the party was Huevos Benedictos but it was way spicer than it looked. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, I was really impressed with the side of pancake ($1. END
BEGIN NOW  75) that came with the Basic Eggs & 2 Sides - so gigantic!. END
BEGIN NOW  They were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives but unfortunately I didn't get to try the Pain Perdue this particular visit. END
BEGIN NOW   Yelp pics look amazing though - can't wait to go back for brunch again to try it!! (Only served during weekend brunch). END
BEGIN NOW  This is definitely a neighborhood gem and worth a visit if you are in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW  Tips: Large parties of 8 or more can call to make reservations before 9am. END
BEGIN NOW   15% auto tip charge on all bills. END
BEGIN NOW   No dinner service. END
BEGIN NOW   No TOGO orders on weekends. END
BEGIN NOW  You know when you walk into a place and it just reminds you of a little piece of your past? That happened for me at Aunt Mary's. END
BEGIN NOW   I can't pinpoint what, but walking in on a later afternoon weekday, to a spacious and airy place, a kind hello and people thoroughly enjoying their food, I knew I was in for a treat. END
BEGIN NOW   A little bit country, a little bit Oakland, this diner is serving up comfort food all day, every day. END
BEGIN NOW   No dinner service here, but they make up for it by offering breakfast until their 3pm closing. END
BEGIN NOW  I can see this place being a shit show on weekend brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   Be patient. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're like me and can enjoy a leisurely weekday meal, as always I suggest that. END
BEGIN NOW   I went with the chilaquiles asking for the two accompanying eggs poached and an iced tea and got to using their free wifi. END
BEGIN NOW  The iced tea was a bucket. END
BEGIN NOW   Straight up the largest mason jar filled with unsweetened iced tea. END
BEGIN NOW   No need for refills, since I mean, there is so much dang liquid. END
BEGIN NOW   Smart. END
BEGIN NOW  The chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW   Not like the one from your local taqueria. END
BEGIN NOW   Lacking in elbow grease from an abuela, they were still a treat for the senses. END
BEGIN NOW   The fried tortilla chips perfectly soft, yet still had a hint of crisp served a pretty perfect bed for the eggs, pico, black beans and avocado. END
BEGIN NOW   The side tortillas were even a bit of an overkill. END
BEGIN NOW   The hint of heat from the verde salsa really rounded up this dish. END
BEGIN NOW  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. END
BEGIN NOW   15% gratuity is included and divided amongst all staff and you can choose to give more which goes directly to your server. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm ok with that. END
BEGIN NOW   My one small gripe? This isn't a cheap endeavor. END
BEGIN NOW   Lunch was around $18, not the cheapest meal you've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back mainly to try more on the menu, especially the hangtown fry-tatta: a frittata with bacon and spinach, topped with fried oysters and fennel slices, drizzled with Rockefeller sauce. END
BEGIN NOW   Yep. END
BEGIN NOW   That's the truth right there. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back, for sure. END
BEGIN NOW  Their BLT is the best sandwich I have ever eaten, and I am not a sandwich person. END
BEGIN NOW   It's the XL bacon strips and spicy aioli generously spread in between the toasty, buttered sandwich bread with crunchy, fresh lettuce that will make you return for this. END
BEGIN NOW  Served with a fresh, green salad NOT overdressed with vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW  The other must-try is their oyster po-boy. END
BEGIN NOW   It's fried to crispy deliciousness. END
BEGIN NOW   I love their refillable iced tea and my husband loves their lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW  Extremely family friendly - They have high chairs and mommas often come here so you're likely to see a breastfeeding mom or two who'll understand if your kiddo has a meltdown. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure if the bathroom has a changing room. END
BEGIN NOW  Call ahead for pick-up if you'd like. END
BEGIN NOW   Tips are automatically included and split among front and back of house staff. END
BEGIN NOW  I love this place, I'll be back, and if there's anything bad to be said - it's that the food's so good, it's a popular spot so expect to wait a little to eat, but be rest assured that your taste buds will be excited and you'll remember your meal and be back soon. END
BEGIN NOW  I really like the food here. END
BEGIN NOW   The oyster po'boy is especially good. END
BEGIN NOW   Stopped going due to this 15% surcharge business. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't want to feel pressured to leave a tip on top of a forced tip -- which is really what it is, regardless of what they choose to call it. END
BEGIN NOW   Check out the card I found on the table the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW   (Sorry, but Yelp does not have a "rotate" function!). END
BEGIN NOW  I have always been a good tipper, and very forgiving of problems that are out of the server's control, so it's not the amount that turns me off, rather the principle. END
BEGIN NOW  Sad, because the food is good, though it is a little high, and perhaps that's why they couldn't just up the food prices rather than institute the surcharge. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm always exploring breakfast and brunch places in Oakland and, given the reviews I had read, I was highly anticipating a great breakfast/brunch here. END
BEGIN NOW   While everything started great, it was just went downhill from there and I walked out very disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW  First, the good stuff: It was very busy, but I was still promptly greeted by hostess who handed me the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW   When she saw I was jus one person, she offered me a seat at the counter. END
BEGIN NOW   Once there, I was promptly attended to by a smiling and friendly server, Sasha, who took coffee order and was patient with me while I decided what I wanted for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW   My meal, the huevos benedictos, was excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   The sauce, not hollandaise, was very spicy, which is great with me! Up until the time Sasha checked on how I liked my meal, she was five stars all the way. END
BEGIN NOW  What went wrong?. END
BEGIN NOW  A few minutes after I was seated, a second hostess came up to me and said that there was a waiting list, implying that I "cut" in front of everybody on the waiting list. END
BEGIN NOW   I told her I tried to get on the list, but another hostess offered me the counter. END
BEGIN NOW   She wanted to know who that was and then she walked away and never said another word to me. END
BEGIN NOW   She was very polite and professional, but I found the encounter offensive, partly because she never apologized. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, she should have checked with the other hostesses before confronting with me. END
BEGIN NOW  The other issues were minor. END
BEGIN NOW   My server never offered to refill my coffee, I had to ask twice. END
BEGIN NOW   She dropped off my bill with a polite comment and was gone before I could say anything to her - without ever asking me if I wanted anything else, which I did. END
BEGIN NOW  Service is as important to me as the food and this was a bad experience, primarily because of the second hostess, not the server. END
BEGIN NOW   Because the food was good, I may try it again someday. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here for brunch once with my sister, dad and niece. END
BEGIN NOW  Everyone seemed to like their food, including my picky 3-year-old niece. END
BEGIN NOW   I ordered the Grilled Flank Steak Sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW   The flavors were great, but my meat was so tough!!!!! It was so awkward to eat because I couldn't rip off a piece and all of it would just come flying out of the bread. END
BEGIN NOW   If the steak wasn't so hard, this sandwich would've been amazing and would've changed how many stars I'm giving this place. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried my sister's catfish sandwich and it was delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Should have gotten that. END
BEGIN NOW  They have an interesting and unique menu which makes me want to come back and try some more. END
BEGIN NOW  After receiving a recommendation of this spot from a co worker, we decided to check it out as we were still looking out for a signature breakfast spot in the East Bay. END
BEGIN NOW    We came here for Sunday brunch and found ourselves only waiting for about  15 minutes for a table. END
BEGIN NOW    We ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW  Lemon ricotta cornmeal pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW  Side of spicy pork sausage. END
BEGIN NOW  Pain perdu. END
BEGIN NOW  Sadly, everything was no more than mediocre. END
BEGIN NOW    The sauce that was served with the pancakes was crazy overpowering. END
BEGIN NOW    It would have been better served without. END
BEGIN NOW    The pancakes, alone, tasted great. END
BEGIN NOW  The homemade sausage, while I appreciated it, was overcooked and dry. END
BEGIN NOW  The whiskey pain perdu fell short. END
BEGIN NOW    After a bite or two, I was over it. END
BEGIN NOW    It looked better than it tasted. END
BEGIN NOW  Service also fell short. END
BEGIN NOW    It was difficult to find someone to ask for our check or get a refill on water and coffee. END
BEGIN NOW    3 stars at most. END
BEGIN NOW  I have to say im only judging off my food experience here. END
BEGIN NOW   I was with a table of 5 and everyone agreed my food was definitely the worst. END
BEGIN NOW   So. END
BEGIN NOW  The bisquits and gravy taste more like bisquit and paste. END
BEGIN NOW   A paste that gives a hint of glue. END
BEGIN NOW  No salt added whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean NONE. END
BEGIN NOW   Possibly the blandest biscuit and gravy I've ever witnessed. END
BEGIN NOW   So much for being whisked away to my childhood. END
BEGIN NOW  Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   No. END
BEGIN NOW  $15 for that atrocity. END
BEGIN NOW  I tasted the waffle of my friends. END
BEGIN NOW   On point. END
BEGIN NOW   Chicken was good too. END
BEGIN NOW  The fried oysters-doable. END
BEGIN NOW  Minus 1 star for having a menu that actually says  "maple flavored syrup" or actual "maple syrup" for $3. END
BEGIN NOW   Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW  no. END
BEGIN NOW   Just serve maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was just ok too. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean I probably wouldnt go back but it's worth a try if your in the area. END
BEGIN NOW  Aunt Mary's is a solid place for breakfast and brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    Although their specialty items are a little more expensive, they're pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW    I enjoyed the posole verde. END
BEGIN NOW    Good pancakes too. END
BEGIN NOW    I didn't like the chicken fried steak too much, I thought the meat was a little rubbery, but the chile sauce on top was good. END
BEGIN NOW    Ingredients are fresh and portions are generous. END
BEGIN NOW  Amazing food and service. END
BEGIN NOW     I saw this place on Diners and Dives and was sold when they showed how to make Shrimp and Grits. END
BEGIN NOW     After visiting our daughter on Mothers day weekend, we got up early to avoid the breakfast rush. END
BEGIN NOW    They opened at 8:00. END
BEGIN NOW    We were greeted and asked to sit where we wanted. END
BEGIN NOW    This area and restaurant setting reminded us of Portland, Oregon. END
BEGIN NOW    Loved it. END
BEGIN NOW    I of course had to try the Shrimp and Grits, which was amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    We watched other food pass by and everything looked amazing. END
BEGIN NOW    You must try Aunt Mary's!. END
BEGIN NOW  I have many happy memories of this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Great appetizers and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW    They have $1 oysters for happy hour and they are always fresh and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   They serve a lot of cool condiments with them that are fun to try and are taste tantalizing. END
BEGIN NOW   If you never had raw oysters before, this is a good place to try it first, because they are small and mild. END
BEGIN NOW   I also highly recommend their deviled eggs. END
BEGIN NOW   I am not crazy about their chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW  that is one dish I would not recommend. END
BEGIN NOW  They have a large selection of wines and the waiters really know what their stuff in case you need help choosing the right drink for your mood. END
BEGIN NOW   No matter how busy they get I've never had an issue with the wait staff and we always were able to get a seat somehow, though we usually get there early. END
BEGIN NOW  Where do I start? I had a detailed review in my head but then realized it was long and would have been a rant, so I will just give pluses and minuses and be brief. END
BEGIN NOW  Started out as a nice warm Oakland evening at the beginning of a three day weekend and looking forward to relaxing with great food and cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks, yes, they were great: sidecar and petit pomme. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice wine list too. END
BEGIN NOW  Started with the roasted cauliflower and baby kale to share. END
BEGIN NOW   The cauliflower was not cooked, and the dish was barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW   Server said it was not intended to be hot. END
BEGIN NOW   We took two bites of raw cauliflower, and she took it away-not going to eat raw cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW   The sauce was rather bland as well. END
BEGIN NOW   Very disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW  Next came our steak and sliders. END
BEGIN NOW   The sliders they got right although the buns were a little dry. END
BEGIN NOW   I could easily overlook this. END
BEGIN NOW   The steak was cooked just right, and the sauce was good, but again the dish came to us barely warm. END
BEGIN NOW   Is this a new thing I just don't know about?  I like my food served hot from pan or grill to plate to table. END
BEGIN NOW  Our fries to share never came; we had to ask for them. END
BEGIN NOW   When they did arrive, they were great-perfectly cooked and seasoned, temp was just right, and aioli was better than most. END
BEGIN NOW   Still disappointing since we had already finished our mains. END
BEGIN NOW   Would have been nice to enjoy both at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh well. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was aloof and uneven. END
BEGIN NOW   They had a crowd but not too busy so there was no reason for delayed service. END
BEGIN NOW   If the kitchen is having timing issues, the server just didn't seem concerned. END
BEGIN NOW   I felt like we just had to take what we got with no apologies, just drop the plate at the table and run. END
BEGIN NOW   There are some nice sounding dishes on the menu I would like to try, but I don't think that will happen any time soon. END
BEGIN NOW  This is not my place; I will not return. END
BEGIN NOW  Pesto pizza, chicken wings, ceviche, wine tasting, cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   My ladies and I had a great night there sharing dinner and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  Busy lively atmosphere for late 20-30-40 somethings. END
BEGIN NOW  I would definitely recommend to others and go back for Friday night happenings. END
BEGIN NOW   The food was great and service was great!. END
BEGIN NOW  Whooooooaaaa there Yelp. END
BEGIN NOW   How have I NOT written a review for one of my favorite happy hours in the East Bay? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW   I genuinely love their happy hour offerings and the food for that is also delish. END
BEGIN NOW   De. END
BEGIN NOW   Lish. END
BEGIN NOW   Umph. END
BEGIN NOW  I actually discovered District's amazing happy hour on a pub crawl. END
BEGIN NOW   Yes. END
BEGIN NOW   That have happy hour on Saturdays. END
BEGIN NOW   You're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW   So once you've had brunch, with bottomless mimosas, started to sober up, and don't want to. END
BEGIN NOW  come here. END
BEGIN NOW  The tables fill up mostly due to reservations. END
BEGIN NOW   #protip. END
BEGIN NOW  But, if you can find yourself at the bar, then go for it. END
BEGIN NOW   Minus a star because the service can be (okay, probably will be) slow. END
BEGIN NOW   But, no one is perfect right?. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu includes $6 house wine, beers, well drinks, and my favorite the food (see photo for menu). END
BEGIN NOW   $6 for 6 oysters, yes. END
BEGIN NOW   Recommendation: go with the truffle fries. END
BEGIN NOW   They are cooked to order so they are not cold. END
BEGIN NOW   They come seasoned with salt, pepper, and what I believe is Rosemary (listed as herbs and truffle Parmesan aioli), ketchup, and the dipping sauce aforementioned. END
BEGIN NOW  It's walkable from 12th street BART and then you can explore old Oakland, head to Jack London Square, or off to the Fox Theatre and Uptown. END
BEGIN NOW   I love it here and definitely recommend it for a stop along the way or a place for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  District isn't a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW    It's a wine bar with food. END
BEGIN NOW    We failed to know this. END
BEGIN NOW  Their menu consists of small plates and pizzas. END
BEGIN NOW    The bf and I ordered six dishes and that was too much. END
BEGIN NOW    Stick to about two dishes per person and you should be good. END
BEGIN NOW    If not, order as you go. END
BEGIN NOW  MUST TRY:. END
BEGIN NOW  The two standout dishes of the night were the tempura avocado and the sliced hanger steak. END
BEGIN NOW    The tempura avocado had a light and crispy exterior, topped with chili lime salt (which was phenomenal), and served with a roasted jalapeno aioli sauce for dipping. END
BEGIN NOW    The hanger steak was so tender that it melts in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW    The topping was that it was served with chimichurri sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  OTHER FOOD:. END
BEGIN NOW  *The raw oysters were medium size and served with a mignonette sauce and fresh horseradish. END
BEGIN NOW    They do have $1 oysters (opposed to $2. END
BEGIN NOW  50 each) during happy hour (weekdays 4-6pm). END
BEGIN NOW  *The steak tartare was okay. END
BEGIN NOW    The bf wasn't a big fan as it was tangier than other places. END
BEGIN NOW    One of the biggest mistakes with the dish was the egg. END
BEGIN NOW    Unlike most places that serve it with a raw egg on top, District's version cooks their egg. END
BEGIN NOW    My egg was more cooked than in pictures I've seen on Yelp and lacked that yolky gooiness. END
BEGIN NOW  *The margherita pizza had a nice thin crust and was perfect for sharing. END
BEGIN NOW    It was topped with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. END
BEGIN NOW    It was good but it needed more tomatoes or tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was nice but staff was often missing so it took a long time getting what we needed. END
BEGIN NOW    There was a bit of a timing issue with food arrival. END
BEGIN NOW    The pace in the beginning was good as we had food in front of us but not to the point of taking up all table room). END
BEGIN NOW    There was so much time between the last couple dishes that food had settled and we were too full. END
BEGIN NOW  Depending on the size of your party, make a reservation on Opentable. END
BEGIN NOW    If reservations aren't made, seating is free for all which we lucked out with. END
BEGIN NOW    District has a limited number of reservations because there is a limited amount of seating. END
BEGIN NOW    Though it's a big place, most of the area is taken for bar seating and lounge areas. END
BEGIN NOW  WHAT TO KNOW:. END
BEGIN NOW  *Full bar. END
BEGIN NOW  *Take advantage of their happy hour specials from 4-6pm. END
BEGIN NOW  *Street parking or a paid lot across the street. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend and I went to district to watch the warriors game last night and had a horrifying experience. END
BEGIN NOW   I asked the bartender to place a order for food and drinks, he rolled his eyes and said I'm kinda busy ( tall large white male). END
BEGIN NOW  My friend who I was with (white) went outside after the game as we waited on the bill to take a call from a Ill family member. END
BEGIN NOW   I went outside to let her know that the bill was ready. END
BEGIN NOW   The manager John ran outside in full stride after me and yelled in front of everybody outside you are banned you are banned for skipping out on your bill. END
BEGIN NOW   I explained to him I was getting her to come pay her portion but he continued to yell that I was banned. END
BEGIN NOW   We gave him our cards and proceeded to walk behind him. END
BEGIN NOW   He told the security not to let me in while he charged our cards. END
BEGIN NOW   When he returned he threw bill holder at my friend with our cards in it which fell on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW   As we checked the bill he charged us double and refused to let us back in to discuss it. END
BEGIN NOW   I have never been so disrespected at an establishment in all my life. END
BEGIN NOW  One of those rare places that does a number of things well, whether it's serving up weekend brunch, offering daily drinks and dinner, or morphing into a thumpin' hangout on late weekend nights. END
BEGIN NOW  No matter what the environment is, the ambience is friendly, casual, diverse, and welcoming in a uniquely Oakland way. END
BEGIN NOW   Brunches here, in particular, are a laid-back way of easing into your weekend day, and there's a wide array of scrumptious offerings to choose from. END
BEGIN NOW   Seems like half of Oakland is here too, all with smiling faces. END
BEGIN NOW  Can't go wrong with this place no matter the purpose. END
BEGIN NOW   Highly recommended. END
BEGIN NOW  My friend wanted to try this place and I was down to because they had $1 oysters. END
BEGIN NOW    When I entered, I stood their awkwardly trying to find a waiter to seat me. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't know that you actually seat yourself. END
BEGIN NOW   (Remember this! So you don't awkwardly stand there and wait for someone to come). END
BEGIN NOW   Once we sat down, it took them awhile to come to the table. END
BEGIN NOW   The service here is extremely slow. END
BEGIN NOW   The food service is fine. END
BEGIN NOW   But grabbing the waiter's attention is extremely difficult. END
BEGIN NOW  I tried the following:. END
BEGIN NOW  Peach Bellini: it was good! But not much for $6. END
BEGIN NOW   I finished it quickly. END
BEGIN NOW   So ordered the next drink. END
BEGIN NOW  Grapefruit beer: it was delicious! I wanted to order another one but I was kind of full. END
BEGIN NOW  Oysters: they were good. END
BEGIN NOW   They waiter asked if we wanted Tabasco and I said yes but they never brought it out. END
BEGIN NOW  Chicken wings: there were 5 wings and they were a lot smaller than I expected. END
BEGIN NOW   It came out on a cute little cast iron skillet. END
BEGIN NOW   The wings were good but I didn't like the sauce it came with. END
BEGIN NOW  I would return for the food but only if I have a lot of time because of their service. END
BEGIN NOW   Parking in that area isn't difficult either so that's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW  It's really more of a 3. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars since it was slightly  over average. END
BEGIN NOW    We came here for appetizers on a Saturday night and it had a pretty good vibe. END
BEGIN NOW    Great mix of people. END
BEGIN NOW  We started with the deviled eggs to wet our appetites. END
BEGIN NOW    Creamy egg with a hint heat from the sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW    Next was the Brussel sprouts which were roasted and blended well with the cider brown butter and almonds. END
BEGIN NOW    We had them hold the pancetta since we were vegetarian. END
BEGIN NOW    Last we had the fontina and spinach arancini which was on a bed of spicy tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW    All very good. END
BEGIN NOW  I think we will go back and try it for dinner next time. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been here twice. END
BEGIN NOW   The first time was lovely, but the second time (last night) was ruined by the female Africa American late 20s, maybe 30ish, bright pink lipstick server who seemed so annoyed by having to get us a couple of drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   All simple questions were answered with a perplexing huffiness. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't think we did anything to set her off, but it was like she hated us the minute we walked in, and there's no place for that in this business. END
BEGIN NOW   Or this world really. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartenders were great, and though we had a table we just started going to them directly to avoid her odd wrath. END
BEGIN NOW  Another plus - gorgeous art!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place was great!. END
BEGIN NOW  Le bf, me, and one of our good couple friends stumbled in here after first getting some beers at The Trappist and some nomz at the Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf was on the hunt for some oysters and he saw a sign advertising them here! Sold. END
BEGIN NOW  The sign advertised $1 oysters at happy hour which we missed (darnit!), but their normal price was $2. END
BEGIN NOW  75. END
BEGIN NOW   My bf and his friend ended up splitting a plate of about 10 oysters with a few beers between them while I got a glass of champagne and split the bread pudding with le other gf. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was great! I'm not a huge fan of oysters in general but these were fresh and flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread pudding wasn't the best I've ever had but was pretty good. END
BEGIN NOW   Was kind of pricey but was also kind of a "scene" type place. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, we really enjoyed posting up and having a few drinks here. END
BEGIN NOW   I would definitely come back here and try more of the food! I think at happy hour (with happy hour prices), this would be a great spot I would actively seek out. END
BEGIN NOW  During my first year of working in Oakland, I would, on average, about once a week, take a lunchtime walk from our office at City Center to Jack London Square, usually approaching via Chinatown and Webster Street while returning via Old Town and Washington Street. END
BEGIN NOW   In the latter area, I've been to Pacific Coast Brewing Company a couple of times, I've glanced at the used bookstore, and have made frequent passages through Swan's Market. END
BEGIN NOW   Also noticed have been a handful of somewhat trendy-looking bars, just awaiting for me to make an appearance. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally, as it often happens, I wind up at a wonderful new location almost by accident. END
BEGIN NOW   A couple of weeks ago we were supposed to meet at another bar about a half block away. END
BEGIN NOW   For whatever reason, however, that location was not open when it said it would be. END
BEGIN NOW   Its loss and The District's gain. END
BEGIN NOW   Or, more precisely, our gain - we now have a reliable standby to go to after a day of putting up with the powers that be. END
BEGIN NOW   Comfy seats at right angles with room for small plates to share, the environment is just made for socializing - public but not too loud; active but with the ability to move around freely. END
BEGIN NOW   Plus the place has a good selection of brews, hard alcohol, and after work food - I recommend the shrimp pizza with chorizo, with a Raging Bitch to wash it down. END
BEGIN NOW   Even though it's not technically on the menu, our waitress complied with my request of an irish coffee, by improvising with Jamesons, and of course, coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  So, a week later, one of the bigwigs at work decided that, for whoever wanted to take him up on the offer, we should do a pubcrawl through Old Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   It says volumes that this crawl began and ended at The District. END
BEGIN NOW  District never disappoints. END
BEGIN NOW   The food and libations are strictly top quality and the staff are very friendly for the most part. END
BEGIN NOW   The only thing on the menu that I've tried and felt "meh" about was the pesto mozzarella pizza. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty bland. END
BEGIN NOW  I also had the chance to host my birthday festivities at District. END
BEGIN NOW   Everyone in my party was treated promptly and the servers made sure my night was special. END
BEGIN NOW   I didn't even have to reserve a couch, I just showed up early with part of my group. END
BEGIN NOW   The space was a little small for my party (around 23 people) but we made it work and stayed out the way (or tried to). END
BEGIN NOW  I booked a table at Bellanico's this week, looking for a restaurant that offered great, authentic Italian food, a great environment and a baby friendly environment. END
BEGIN NOW    They delivered!. END
BEGIN NOW  When we arrived they had a table for four adults and a high chair ready for us, a little offset from the rest of the dining room which was much appreciated. END
BEGIN NOW    Right off the bat, our waiter was courteous, knowledgeable and professional. END
BEGIN NOW    He was present when we needed him but not overbearing - just the right balance. END
BEGIN NOW    Most importantly, he was patient with our group taking some time to reach decisions as he was with a 2-year old walking around the table non-stop. END
BEGIN NOW  Our food was outright excellent. END
BEGIN NOW    Cooked to perfection, perfectly seasoned and immaculately presented. END
BEGIN NOW    The menu presents a wide array of choices to satisfy wide arrays of preferences, which we needed for our group. END
BEGIN NOW    There are many appetizers to choose from, of which many also cater well to being shared as a group. END
BEGIN NOW    In main courses, there are several pasta and non-pastas to choose from, and they all look delicious!. END
BEGIN NOW  As a trained sommelier, I was happy to see that the diversity of the menu was reflected in the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW    It's mostly Italian, and reflects all of the major wine producing areas - not a generic list of 15 different Chiantis. END
BEGIN NOW    We chose the Aglianico del Vulture which was I was happy to find - I think it's the first time I've seen it at a restaurant in California. END
BEGIN NOW    The list also has wines from France and Spain. END
BEGIN NOW  I've been looking for restaurant that has all of the above for sometime, and I am happy I found Bellanico's. END
BEGIN NOW    We will be visiting many more times. END
BEGIN NOW  Just had a very awkward exchange with the lady behind the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm not sure if it's the way I look or was dressed but every question I had was returned with a confused look. END
BEGIN NOW   Do you accept credit for gift certificates? I thought that was a valid question because some stores only allow debit or cash payment for gift cards. END
BEGIN NOW   Can I use your phone to call my brother to make sure the gift certificate is addressed right? Another perplexed look. END
BEGIN NOW   Then I was handed the receipt where there was a section for tip, I'll chalk this one up to how the system is set up but they may want to exclude a tip section for buying a gift card. END
BEGIN NOW  -I did call after and she was much nicer but still a weird encounter. END
BEGIN NOW  I live up the street and if I was more impressed with this place, I would go more. END
BEGIN NOW   Yes, the food is really good. END
BEGIN NOW   Portions are very small. END
BEGIN NOW   If My girlfriend and I were to walk out of here with a drink and a full stomach, we wouldn't leave paying less than a $100 and that's probably without tip. END
BEGIN NOW  We've had good service here before and the food is tasty. END
BEGIN NOW   Three stars for that. END
BEGIN NOW   Minus two stars for the way I was treated this past time and the small portion size and no beer on tap (I get it, it's a wine place but have at least one beer, this is California). END
BEGIN NOW  Been several times. END
BEGIN NOW   Always good. END
BEGIN NOW   Looked at menu at competitor down the street. END
BEGIN NOW   Big ass television for Warrior game. END
BEGIN NOW   No thank you. END
BEGIN NOW   That's what sports bars and living rooms are created to accommodate. END
BEGIN NOW   Italian meals are about good food, conversations, and no cell phones. END
BEGIN NOW   Went back to Bellancio-no reservation, but early for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW   Seated promptly. END
BEGIN NOW   Fried green olives - more addicting than crack. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a Negroni and an Aperol spritz ( my wife) Great wine from Montalcatino. END
BEGIN NOW   Best pork chop ever! Service was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW  Almost had a Tony Soprano moment. END
BEGIN NOW   Why do you hipsters and no etiquette knowing men wear your stupid baseball hats indoors and in a dinner house? My wife kept one of you from a good stare-down and punch out from a former Marine having dinner on Memorial Day. END
BEGIN NOW  Restaurant Week Review!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  Bellanico has a phenomenal menu, and they have really chosen a tasting menu that shows off the diversity of the dishes they offer. END
BEGIN NOW   I *almost* came back for lunch today, but decided to try a different menu solely for the sake of variety. END
BEGIN NOW   The space is very warm and inviting; it reminded us of being in a small cafe in Europe. END
BEGIN NOW   The servers were really nice, and the owner spent time walking around and making sure everything was going o. END
BEGIN NOW  k. END
BEGIN NOW   without being too obtrusive; he obviously cares a lot about his customers' experience. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu started out with two small appetizers, both practically bite-size. END
BEGIN NOW   They were a nice start to the menu; they provided a small tasting and good flavor. END
BEGIN NOW  Next followed the "primi" course; we chose "tombo tuna" and "braised lamb belly. END
BEGIN NOW  " While probably the weakest course on the menu, the proteins in each of these dishes were still really good. END
BEGIN NOW   We were not super happy with the chickpeas in the tuna dish or the red mustard in the lamb belly, but aside from those two items, both dishes were still strong. END
BEGIN NOW  The secondi dishes were very strong; we ordered the ono (turned out to be trout) and pork tenderloin. END
BEGIN NOW   The pork tenderloin was the star dish of the night; I would *HIGHLY* recommend ordering it. END
BEGIN NOW   The trout was also pretty good, although probably fishier than the ono would have been. END
BEGIN NOW  For desert, you will get a sampling of deserts (unless you are here for lunch, in case you will have to choose). END
BEGIN NOW   The espresso panna cotta and hazelnut cakes were both really, really good; I would have a tough time choosing between them. END
BEGIN NOW   The hazelnut cake came warm from the oven and with homemade ice cream: yum! The cheesecake had a very strong goat aftertaste. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, we were very happy with our decision to try this great little cafe for restaurant week!. END
BEGIN NOW  This was my first visit to this cute neighborhood gem. END
BEGIN NOW   I was quite impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Buzzy warm vibe on a Friday night. END
BEGIN NOW   Smaller restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating (enclosed patio with heaters). END
BEGIN NOW  The menu was impressive because it was very unique. END
BEGIN NOW   Not your typical Italian eatery. END
BEGIN NOW   A lot to explore. END
BEGIN NOW   They also offer the option of a fix prix menu or a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW   We opted for a la cart. END
BEGIN NOW  We began with the tuna crudo with watermelon radish and grapefruit. END
BEGIN NOW   To accompany this appetizer we got the warm farro with hen of the woods mushrooms, cranberries, and walnuts. END
BEGIN NOW   A fantastic pairing to share with the tuna crudo!. END
BEGIN NOW  Next, we shared the pasta with tomatoe sauce and hot peppers. END
BEGIN NOW   A super cool feature that they offer is the option to order dishes as appetizer or entree size! I love this because it gives you a lot of freedom. END
BEGIN NOW   You can order a bunch of dishes and share them rather than just having one entree. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun!. END
BEGIN NOW  Then there is the wine list. END
BEGIN NOW   Again, I was impressed. END
BEGIN NOW   Wines offered from many regions. END
BEGIN NOW   We explored some cool Italian whites and reds. END
BEGIN NOW   And once again, they allow you to order half or full glasses. END
BEGIN NOW   And they have a full menu of wine tasting flights. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun, fun, fun!. END
BEGIN NOW  Our server was fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun guy, originally from Mexico, who clearly loves what he does. END
BEGIN NOW   Passionate. END
BEGIN NOW   Attentive. END
BEGIN NOW   Knowledgeable. END
BEGIN NOW   And just fun to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW  We ended our meal with the most delicious goat cheese cheescake. END
BEGIN NOW   That was a first. END
BEGIN NOW  and boy was it amazing. END
BEGIN NOW   Covered with pistachio toffee crumbles and paired with strawberries. END
BEGIN NOW   I would go back just to order that again. END
BEGIN NOW  We will return. END
BEGIN NOW   Bravo. END
BEGIN NOW  Finally. END
BEGIN NOW    OMG finally. END
BEGIN NOW    An Italian restaurant I can finally love coming too. END
BEGIN NOW    It's been a long, hard battle to even find a decent meal in the Bay Area, and I found my gem in the most boring part of this area. END
BEGIN NOW    Who would have guessed. END
BEGIN NOW  Everything, from start to finish, was stellar. END
BEGIN NOW    Just complex enough to make you feel special, and simple enough where it felt casual. END
BEGIN NOW    Perfect!  The $40 fix price menu is a steal. END
BEGIN NOW    We did that with an additional app, and a main, and the portions were right on. END
BEGIN NOW    The chocolate pot de creme desert. END
BEGIN NOW  whoa. END
BEGIN NOW  it's like a lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW  on par with Angelines chocolate pot de creme and Chez Mama's choco lava cake. END
BEGIN NOW  I will be back here again, and again. END
BEGIN NOW    It's simply stellar Italian. END
BEGIN NOW    Yes it's not a hip part of town, yes there are all old people in here, if you drove by you'd think some local dump restaurant that people go to because it's convenient. END
BEGIN NOW    You'd be wrong. END
BEGIN NOW  Only miss:  I went to brunch before, and was not impressed. END
BEGIN NOW    At all. END
BEGIN NOW    I was skeptical when the gf said this is her fave place. END
BEGIN NOW    But after dinner, I took back my insults from the brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  Three stars because this neighborhood needs one remaining place you can get a decent glass of wine in a cute setting. END
BEGIN NOW    The food is challenging. END
BEGIN NOW    Perhaps if you stick to apps and drinks you'll be alright, but the mains, in my experience, vary from over salted to mushy, to flavorless. END
BEGIN NOW   Good luck. END
BEGIN NOW  I have no idea how Bellanico received it's 4 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I was deceived. END
BEGIN NOW  To summarize: great service, cute spot, feels over-crowded, food is not good and I will never come back. END
BEGIN NOW  What we ordered:. END
BEGIN NOW  Duck Pate - literally slabs of pate on toast. END
BEGIN NOW   Presentation was terrible and the pate taste off. END
BEGIN NOW  Pork belly- not what I expected. END
BEGIN NOW   It came on a skewer of chewy pork belly and fingerling potatoes and I liked the potatoes more. END
BEGIN NOW  Ribeye - OK steak but nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW   Temperature was correct and came with bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW  Being the snazzy little Yelper I am, I snagged a 6 pm reservation on the last day of Restaurant Week (truth: Mr. END
BEGIN NOW   P knew exactly what would brighten my day and stumbled across an abandoned reservation on Open Table). END
BEGIN NOW   This area can be a little limited in parking, so give yourself some extra time. END
BEGIN NOW  Romantic lighting, enclosed patio seating, new silverware between each course. END
BEGIN NOW   this is a very nice date night with all the lovely details without being pretentious. END
BEGIN NOW   Very attentive and kind staff who put up with all my batty questions and gave me great suggestions. END
BEGIN NOW   (For whatever reason I have the hardest time figuring out what is on Italian menus unless it's crystal clear. END
BEGIN NOW   Agnolotti, tortelli, sformato. END
BEGIN NOW   err. END
BEGIN NOW  ). END
BEGIN NOW  I could slowly talk you through bite by bite, but I'm going to just get to the point. END
BEGIN NOW   The bacala was my absolute favorite, and I could probably eat the dark and white panna cotta every day for the rest of my life. END
BEGIN NOW   I think whatever you order here will be a delightful culinary experience. END
BEGIN NOW   Also it doesn't hurt coming here during restaurant week when you can indulge for just $30 per person. END
BEGIN NOW   Such a steal!. END
BEGIN NOW  What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant! Bellanico is a local gem that has stellar service to match their scrumptious menu. END
BEGIN NOW  We came here on a lazy Sunday with our two young kids. END
BEGIN NOW   They were offering their Oakland Restaurant week brunch menu for $24, to which you can add wine pairing for $10. END
BEGIN NOW  Here's what we tried:. END
BEGIN NOW  Burrata with roasted baby beets -- they make their own burrata, which works really well with the Grillo white paired with it. END
BEGIN NOW  Braised and seared pork belly -- loved the crispy skin and tender meat, specially with the "Merlau" red. END
BEGIN NOW  Poached eggs and prosciutto on country bread -- liked this version of Eggs Benedict, paired with a Bordeaux blanc. END
BEGIN NOW  Butternut squash and goat cheese frittata -- fluffy and creamy, yet quite filling. END
BEGIN NOW   Paired well with a Loire white blend. END
BEGIN NOW  Dark and white chocolate panna cotta -- rich and creamy. END
BEGIN NOW  Florentine doughnuts - our kids loved this with the sage custard sauce and chocolate dip. END
BEGIN NOW   Only problem was that there were only 5 small pieces for $8. END
BEGIN NOW  Goat cheese cheesecake with pistachio brittle -- my fave dessert, love the savory cheese with the crunchy brittle. END
BEGIN NOW  Our brunch also came with complimentary muffins. END
BEGIN NOW   My kids loved these and our server was gracious enough to provide us with another helping! Overall, we highly recommend Bellanico and look forward to coming back!. END
BEGIN NOW  Parking: It was a little tough and hard to find street parking. END
BEGIN NOW   Luckily on Sunday we found a few spots and parking was free. END
BEGIN NOW   With my handicapped brother it was also hard to find any parking near the hotel for easier access. END
BEGIN NOW   There were a few loading zone spots out front (handicapped can park there for as long as needed!) So if you have anyone that needs to be closer, that could work. END
BEGIN NOW  Wow! So glad I chose this place for my birthday brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   I was able to make reservations a week in advance for a party of 7. END
BEGIN NOW   We got an excellent view of the lake and I really enjoyed the glass windows and interiors. END
BEGIN NOW   They had live jazz music playing as well! Impressive! Their Irish coffee is strong! Be forewarned!!! I needed a nap after. END
BEGIN NOW   I enjoyed the food as well, splitting a classic mushroom omelette and biscuits and gravy with my boyfriend. END
BEGIN NOW   They were able to do a side pancake for me which was nice since that was unlisted on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW   I also tried a bit of the Jack London omelette, which had delicious chunks of crab in it. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all its a great place to bring your family and they take reservations. END
BEGIN NOW   Good views, good food and good service. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect for special occasions or if you want a nice fancier atmosphere for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  We reserved a table for 4 people here on Saturday via opentable. END
BEGIN NOW   However, when we arrived it was clear they didn't want us there. END
BEGIN NOW   Even though we had a reservation, they didn't even ask our names. END
BEGIN NOW   Instead the hostess rudely quipped 'if you want to sit down you'll have to order within 2 minutes, we have an event today. END
BEGIN NOW  ' We tried to explain we had a reservation and by now a few team members had come over but only to give us a similarly rude message 'if your party isn't here very soon, they can't order'. END
BEGIN NOW   We quickly left. END
BEGIN NOW  This could all have been avoided by simply not accepting a reservation that you can't service, and when it happens - be nice about it. END
BEGIN NOW  Coming to celebrate a graduation, we came to The Terrace Room for brunch as a big group on a Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW   With the exception of the view, I'd say the place is pretty average. END
BEGIN NOW  Part I: The Untrained Waitress. END
BEGIN NOW  Although the waitress was nice, she had no clue about the menu, how to properly pour a champagne and the fact that water should be refilled for clients. END
BEGIN NOW   Not only did she overpour the champagne glass, but managed to hold the bottle as if she is pouring vodka after a day at a Russian sauna (holding it with a grasp at the neck). END
BEGIN NOW   Didn't leave the cork on the table either. END
BEGIN NOW   Anyways, she didn't even know that Mumm sparkling wine was on the menu and I had to point her directly to it. END
BEGIN NOW   I mean, it's a brunch restaurant, there are 3 sparkling wines on the menu, does one really need a curriculum to learn them? Unacceptable. END
BEGIN NOW  Part II: The Standard Menu. END
BEGIN NOW  Moving on, the menu is pretty average and the food was good. END
BEGIN NOW   It wasn't anything to make me brag about this spot to a friend, but it was good. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the Crab eggs Benedict and it was fine. END
BEGIN NOW   Another person at our table had the chorizo omelet and had similar impressions. END
BEGIN NOW  Part III: The Shining. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes, there is an area where they shine and I am confident they already know it. END
BEGIN NOW   The view from the table is killer, overlooking the lake, it just adds a relaxing feel to the whole establishment. END
BEGIN NOW   Good spot for family pictures. END
BEGIN NOW  Conclusion:. END
BEGIN NOW  Would I come back? Perhaps, if I ran out of other options to try, but it's an average restaurant with an above average view. END
BEGIN NOW   Had the waitress been better versed in the service industry, I would have given 4 stars for the view and food. END
BEGIN NOW  We were here last night again for the Y's yearly Annual Campaign Victory dinner and I was looking forward to the beautiful view, spending time with friends and having a wonderful meal. END
BEGIN NOW    I can say that I had all three but there were some rude glitches along the way. END
BEGIN NOW    Dinner wasn't served until around 6:45 or 7 so we had a chance to have something to drink at the bar and chat with our friends. END
BEGIN NOW  I used my yelp check-in and noticed that I could get $3 off any happy hour food or drinks so I showed the bartender my yelp check-in. END
BEGIN NOW    She indicated that if I was part of the Y event, that I could not use my happy hour check-in; however, I was paying for my alcoholic drink and it was not part of the banquet we were attending as other patrons were in the bar. END
BEGIN NOW    That didn't seem fair to me. END
BEGIN NOW    However, I was able to get my discount for my drink. END
BEGIN NOW    Then later during the dinner, one of my friends at our table, asked for some ketchup and the waiter rudely indicated that ketchup was not part of the banquet menu, what????. END
BEGIN NOW  Then when the delicious dessert was being served, the waiter was asking us who wanted coffee, another friend asked for his cup to be filled but he only had his cup filled 1/4?  I asked the same waiter for some coffee and mine was full. END
BEGIN NOW    This is the same waiter who refused to give another friend at our table ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW  I didn't know the wait staff was so rude. END
BEGIN NOW    I have never had a bad experience with the wait staff here at The Terrace Room. END
BEGIN NOW  Going here transports me back to a by-gone era. END
BEGIN NOW   It's so easy sitting in this place to imagine how it was in the 20s. END
BEGIN NOW   It's especially nice when the sun is out and you get that nice view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW   They have live music a lot, which obviously aligns with that historical period. END
BEGIN NOW   All this adds up to a really unique, fun and relaxing ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW  They have pretty awesome drink specials when the do have happy hour. END
BEGIN NOW   If you ask me, they need to extend their happy hours a bit, as the place is never mobbed or anything. END
BEGIN NOW   It probably won't ever be a very trendy place as it IS inside a retirement home ;-) It's actually pretty neat on swing nights seeing the 20 somethings who are into swing cause it's cool again mix with the folks that dug it when it was cool originally. END
BEGIN NOW  Although this place shares a building with a senior living center, it doesn't smell like old people. END
BEGIN NOW   Lol! They have a lounge area before entering the restaurant part with a piano which was dope. END
BEGIN NOW   Esp since there was someone there playing. END
BEGIN NOW  The view of the lake is really what you're paying for here. END
BEGIN NOW   Our waitress, Brittany, was very professional and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   She was upbeat and prompt with anything we needed. END
BEGIN NOW   Loved how our champagne was never empty for too long. END
BEGIN NOW   $17 for bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. END
BEGIN NOW   The + about this place is you can switch off between the two. END
BEGIN NOW   And they had a bloody mary bar for you to have fun with. END
BEGIN NOW  The food was a little disappointing. END
BEGIN NOW   The brunch menu was a bit limited and the quality of the food was below what it's worth. END
BEGIN NOW   However, they had a cute basket of mini muffins that were tasty and moist which was different from other brunch places. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all it was good to try this place out. END
BEGIN NOW   I wouldn't mind coming here again but it would be for the view. END
BEGIN NOW   While the food wasn't horrible, there's nothing exciting about it either. END
BEGIN NOW  - Overpriced food that wasn't prepared well and hardly met an "ok" standard. END
BEGIN NOW  - Bad service and waiting time. END
BEGIN NOW  - No parking. END
BEGIN NOW  - Possible food poising/horrible gas. END
BEGIN NOW  This was a second dinner option selection due to a nearby restaurant that was closed for a private party. END
BEGIN NOW   Unfortunately we made the wrong choice and ate here. END
BEGIN NOW  Yes it has an amazing view of Lake Merritt, but other than that this place doesn't have anything going to for them. END
BEGIN NOW  The menu is small, I ordered the soup of the day which was mushroom creme, it was just okay. END
BEGIN NOW   Nothing special and was somewhat separated. END
BEGIN NOW   For an entree I ordered roasted chicken that came with some kind of rice and scallions ($25) with a side of there potatoes ($6). END
BEGIN NOW   When the dish came it looked awful to begin with and was swimming in a pool of oil. END
BEGIN NOW   The roasted chicken was a pale skin color all over and had a lot of gristle. END
BEGIN NOW   Not to mention is was two dark meat pieces (legs) the cheapest part of chicken meat. END
BEGIN NOW   The potatoes where whole but needed some sort of sauce that was absent. END
BEGIN NOW   The grains on the dish had a nice flavor but the greens and chicken were so overpowered by oil that it was difficult to enjoy any of this dish at all. END
BEGIN NOW  The servers were friendly but it was unclear who our actual server was and we seemed to be seen mostly by the host who was busy seating. END
BEGIN NOW   It was not until the end of our meal that anyone checked in about how the experience was or if we need refills on drinks or water. END
BEGIN NOW  Now, about an hour later our group has all ended up in the bathroom and. END
BEGIN NOW   How do I say this nicely. END
BEGIN NOW   But our stomachs are in a lot of pain and it's a good thing we like each other because there's some serious gas and bathroom time happening. END
BEGIN NOW  This is the place for a girl's brunch. END
BEGIN NOW   First of all the lighting is amazing so all those selfies you're pretending you're not planning on taking will look INCREDIBLE. END
BEGIN NOW   The brunch options are diverse and doesn't have to kill your budget. END
BEGIN NOW   The food is a bit hit or miss, though. END
BEGIN NOW   My first time here I got the breakfast bagel sandwich and it was utter bliss, and everyone in my group (we were a party of 9) were served speedily and everyone was happy. END
BEGIN NOW   The next time I came, almost every person had a problem with their order (the wrong sides were brought out, goat cheese was missing from a goat cheese omelet). END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back again because this is a lovely place on lovely Lake Merritt, and I'll update this review to see if that day was a fluke or if it's a consistent thing. END
BEGIN NOW  Regards, I'll be back because the service is great and the view is honestly worth it alone. END
BEGIN NOW  As I predicted in my initial review, we didn't rush back here. END
BEGIN NOW    We returned for dinner and music tonight w/ Nina and Larry. END
BEGIN NOW    We found parking a few blocks away and arrived in time for our 6:30 reservations. END
BEGIN NOW    It was still light out and we had a lovely view of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW    One of the things that encouraged our return, beside the music, was knowing that Louis Le Gassic, formerly chef at Bay Wolf, had been appointed as their new Executive Chef. END
BEGIN NOW    We were excited to try the food. END
BEGIN NOW    The group, Juke Joint, started performing at 7:00 on the bandstand I had observed the last time we were there for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW  We were brought menus and a plate of sliced bread w/ a ramekin of soft butter. END
BEGIN NOW    Nina, Larry and I all decided to have glasses of Malbec while Alan opted for a glass of Downtown Brown, which Larry shared. END
BEGIN NOW    I ordered a cup of turnip and apple soup w/ a float of truffle oil on top. END
BEGIN NOW    Alan, Nina and I ordered rack of lamb, which came w/ white beans and garlic green beans and Larry ordered salmon. END
BEGIN NOW    Alan and I ordered a side of honey braised carrots. END
BEGIN NOW    The soup was smooth and tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    The lamb was cooked medium rare and was topped w/ a tasty salsa verde, which was almost like chimichurri. END
BEGIN NOW    Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW    The carrots were good, as were the white and green beans. END
BEGIN NOW    The wine was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    For dessert Nina and I shared an Irish coffee crème brulée, which was tasty. END
BEGIN NOW    Alan had a fresh fruit plate. END
BEGIN NOW    He and Larry had coffee. END
BEGIN NOW    Service was smooth and just attentive enough. END
BEGIN NOW  The music was marvelous. END
BEGIN NOW    Several couples got up to dance, which was fun to watch. END
BEGIN NOW    One in particular was sensational. END
BEGIN NOW    We really enjoyed it and would have stayed even longer than we did, but the band took a break and Larry was ready to go so we left. END
BEGIN NOW    According to the Terrace Room website they have live music Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and Sundays at 11:00 for brunch. END
BEGIN NOW    They have quite an impressive lineup of folks scheduled to play and I can see us returning to hear more music w/ another enjoyable meal. END
BEGIN NOW  Super delicious! My friend lives across the street and neither one of us had been here. END
BEGIN NOW   I had just finished the Nike Women's Half in SF so I rightfully needed to consume all the calories. END
BEGIN NOW  We lucked out and scored a table immediately by the window. END
BEGIN NOW   Score. END
BEGIN NOW   I love a view. END
BEGIN NOW  I fueled up with a cup of coffee ($4 - minus a star because I cannot understand why a cup of coffee is $4) and a water. END
BEGIN NOW   My friend ordered two eyes, with wheat toast, and mini waffles. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the Jack London omelet (crab, arugula, hollandaise, and I had egg whites) with wheat toast, and home fries. END
BEGIN NOW   Mouth. END
BEGIN NOW   Watering. END
BEGIN NOW   I loved the little fruit garnish and was close to licking the plate before Jack came to take it away. END
BEGIN NOW  Jack was my server. END
BEGIN NOW   Nice, hipster looking fellow who was attentive, funny, and prompt. END
BEGIN NOW  So four stars! I'll be back with for sure. END
BEGIN NOW  just won't be getting $4 coffee. END
BEGIN NOW  Terribly rude, we walked in with a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW   As soon as we walked in we were rudely asked to wait with no explanation, the hostess didnt even ask our name or if we had a reservation. END
BEGIN NOW  When we explained our reservation, she chirped back that we'd have two minutes to order. END
BEGIN NOW  Then the chef and another hostess came out to add to their rudeness and certainly NOT make us feel welcome. END
BEGIN NOW   We turned around and walked out. END
BEGIN NOW   Never coming again. END
BEGIN NOW  So I don't normally write yelp reviews, but I had a uniquely awful experience at the Terrace Room last night (Wednesday 4/20). END
BEGIN NOW   I'll start from the beginning:. END
BEGIN NOW  I was walking around Lake Merritt around 6pm and heard some amazing live music coming from this gorgeous glass room across the street. END
BEGIN NOW   Naturally, I had to check it out. END
BEGIN NOW   I find myself in the Terrace Room, which is incredibly beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW   I decide to sit at the bar because I was not in the mood for a formal dinner. END
BEGIN NOW   It was pretty busy but the bartender got to me in record time and whipped up a mean Old Fashioned (the classic old fashioned way with a sugar cube and muddler) and convinced me to order the nachos. END
BEGIN NOW   If this review was about the nachos alone, they'd be getting 5 stars. END
BEGIN NOW   I wish I'd had the foresight to snap a pic to post because they were a work of art. END
BEGIN NOW   The brisket was so tender and the cheese was definitely drool-inducing. END
BEGIN NOW   So let's just say I was in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW  Then, this tiny rude server starts complaining to her that she opened a bottle of wine for him that she shouldn't have. END
BEGIN NOW   (I really was not trying to pay attention but he was making a spectacle). END
BEGIN NOW   She immediately apologized, and gave him an unopened bottle and got back to making drinks for the large group of women at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Then, for whatever reason, he continued to harp on and on about the opened bottle of wine, which was very rude and unprofessional. END
BEGIN NOW   I was just trying to watch the bands on stage, but instead was so rudely distracted by this one-man show. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't know how the bartender kept her cool, I woulda lost it. END
BEGIN NOW   I also happened to make awkward eye contact with several other people sitting at the bar, sharing looks of discomfort/annoyance with the server's display, so I know I'm not just unusually observant. END
BEGIN NOW  Thought he was done but oh no he comes back barking his orders at her. END
BEGIN NOW   What really got me was that when she'd rush to make the drinks, they'd then sit there for at least TEN minutes getting diluted/warm/shitty. END
BEGIN NOW   Honestly, I felt really bad for that woman. END
BEGIN NOW   just another example of men feeling the need to verbally abuse and dominate a young and talented girl. END
BEGIN NOW   I made it known to her that I respected and admired her hard work, and she just smiled and shrugged, as if it was no big deal. END
BEGIN NOW  All in all I came to enjoy the music and food/drinks, but this tiny little man just kept ruining the ambience and experience. END
BEGIN NOW   It is beyond me how a manager and restaurant allows for such inappropriate behavior, let alone allow it to disrupt the experience of a patron. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks were great and the music wonderful, but it pains me too much to see that behavior, so I will not be coming back. END
BEGIN NOW  Bottomless bloody Mary's and/or mimosas, what could be better?. END
BEGIN NOW  Started off with a bloody Mary and told the waitress I would be switching to mimosas afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW   She forgot, no big so I had two bloody Mary's and then switched. END
BEGIN NOW  I was going to get the chicken and waffles, but the waitress informed me that it was two wings and not breast as I had hoped so instead got the two egg breakfast with bacon and sausage. END
BEGIN NOW   They didn't skimp on the meat which was awesome and the English muffin was nicely toasted. END
BEGIN NOW  They started us off with mini muffins and fresh jam that were a very nice touch. END
BEGIN NOW  We sat by the window which provides an amazing view of the lake, overall great experience. END
BEGIN NOW  Located in the same building in, or at least next door to, a senior living facility, the Terrace Room offers a gorgeous view of Lake Merritt from the west, which means that most of the time you won't be blinded by the sun like you would from the other side of the lake. END
BEGIN NOW  The food offerings include all the usual dishes you'd expect of a mainstream Californian restaurant, with the dishes sticking more towards the familiar instead of the inventive. END
BEGIN NOW   Moreover, given the generally average quality of the dishes, the prices seem just a bit steep. END
BEGIN NOW  Overall, the atmosphere here is rather quiet and sedate. END
BEGIN NOW   Adding to this is the fact that, lake view aside, the place feels like a country cottage. END
BEGIN NOW   Your best bet would probably be brunch, when you can enjoy a sunny view of the lake, and when other folks dining at the restaurant are also in sunny dispositions. END
BEGIN NOW  They have TRIVIA every other monday night at 7:30!!! It's really fun. END
BEGIN NOW   The hosts are cool, the food is good, the drinks are fun (but kind of expensive). END
BEGIN NOW   The parking is easy then because its late on a monday. END
BEGIN NOW   I parked right against the lake, literally in front of the building. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're looking for a place in Oakland to play trivia - you've found it. END
BEGIN NOW   The questions range from anything about pop culture, history, oakland themed, etc. END
BEGIN NOW   It's hard, but not too hard. END
BEGIN NOW   6 people to a team. END
BEGIN NOW   The prizes are gift certificates to the Terrace room. END
BEGIN NOW   I had a blast when I went with my friends. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll definitely be going back!. END
BEGIN NOW  Note: The entrace to the terrace room is through the hotel entrance. END
BEGIN NOW   ((I had trouble finding it the first time I went there)). END
BEGIN NOW  Ok, first of all, one of the bartenders are not very nice. END
BEGIN NOW   Service is slow, and I'm not sure if it was the colour of my skin, or just lack of skill, but I didn't feel very welcomed. END
BEGIN NOW   The girl, Molly was nice, and I appreciated her interaction. END
BEGIN NOW   Also, it literally took 40 minutes on a not so busy night to get a grilled cheese sandwich (which I had tipped before getting it). END
BEGIN NOW   I was so offended and turned off of my interaction, and the way the bar tender treated my fiend and I, I did not eat my food. END
BEGIN NOW  I also love how the bartender commented "you know no body cares" while I wrote this review, and yes this comment was directed at me. END
BEGIN NOW   HE WAS SO RUDE ! Won't recommend a place that doesn't care about their customers, just saying!. END
BEGIN NOW  very nice bartender. END
BEGIN NOW   not the most crowded on a friday night but it was kind of nice not having to shove your way through everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW   seems like more of a started bar?. END
BEGIN NOW  someone said that they have amazing whiskey sours in their review. END
BEGIN NOW   i was excited but disappointed that they served their whiskey sours in the -not with egg white- fashion. END
BEGIN NOW   nevertheless, it was still well made. END
BEGIN NOW   but again, just thought the drinks were reasonably priced and jsut good. END
BEGIN NOW  Meet my favorite cocktail bar in Oakland! I last ended up here after being booted out of Fauna. END
BEGIN NOW   Oh, Fauna, when will you do something about your absurdly early last call times? We decided to head down the street and continue the festivities for my birthday. END
BEGIN NOW  After getting a nice happy birthday wish from the doorman, we headed inside to grab some drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   The cocktails here were, as usual, amazingly tasty and reasonably priced ($9 - $12). END
BEGIN NOW   If memory serves me correct, I stuck with my favorites: Bee's Knees and Stones Throw. END
BEGIN NOW   Hooray for ginger beer! And, hooray for cool bartenders too!. END
BEGIN NOW  It was just after midnight on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't too crowded. END
BEGIN NOW   Our group was able to secure a table, relax, and enjoy the rest of the night. END
BEGIN NOW  Tip: This place is conveniently located nearby the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW  Bonus Birthday Tip: There's a food stand about a block away with bacon-wrapped hot dogs! As if that wasn't enough, the woman running the stand is absolutely hilarious!. END
BEGIN NOW  Dogwood is a solid bar in a happening stretch of town, right near the Fox Theatre where Telegraph branches off Broadway towards the north. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a good variety of tasty cocktails to choose from, and the bartenders are knowledgeable and and friendly enough to make anything you want. END
BEGIN NOW   What's more, there's a decent menu of munchies, like the totally delicious cubanito sandwich I tried. END
BEGIN NOW   While the interior might feel a bit dark as you walk in, you'll adjust quickly to the cozy yet retro-sleek ambience. END
BEGIN NOW  Also, you have to give the owners credit for sticking it out here over the years. END
BEGIN NOW   Dogwood is located on such a busy street corner that drunk drivers have crashed into it twice, while rioters have also smashed the windows twice. END
BEGIN NOW   Nevertheless, the area is on the way up and  the owners have bounced back each time. END
BEGIN NOW   Judging by the healthy crowds this place gets, it looks like the community has embraced Dogwood as well. END
BEGIN NOW  Came here before a show at the Fox Theater to grab a few drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The bees knees was sweet and yummy. END
BEGIN NOW   It's dangerous because it really doesn't taste like alcohol at all. END
BEGIN NOW   The 2nd cocktail I had (and the name I completely forgot) was described by the bartender as an adult version of an orange julius, and she was spot on. END
BEGIN NOW   It was refreshing and the egg whites made it super rich and frothy. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried a sip of what the bf drank (stones throw and farmer's daughter) and they were all good!. END
BEGIN NOW  Of course, we had to try the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   And the reviews aren't kidding when they say it's BOMB DOT COM. END
BEGIN NOW   Perfect to munch on with your drinks!! Buttery, cheesy goodness. END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn't busy when we went so we were able to find seats and service was quick and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW  I'll be back!. END
BEGIN NOW  $5 for a delicious, buttery, perfectly pressed grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   The option to add sundried tomato, basil, and mushrooms. END
BEGIN NOW   Little cornichons on the side. END
BEGIN NOW   Mustard (the good stuff, mind you, none of that French's yellow) provided without asking. END
BEGIN NOW   Dogwood literally served me my dream sandwich on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW   If that isn't culinary inception, I don't know what is. END
BEGIN NOW  As for cocktails, they are creative, tasty, and strong. END
BEGIN NOW   I love the Brooklyn, and the Bees Knees is, well, the BEES KNEES. END
BEGIN NOW   It's true you may have to wait - Dogwood can be packed late at night, and usually have just one bartender during happy hours/early evening. END
BEGIN NOW   I hate waiting, but if I had to wait, there's nowhere I'd rather hang around than a converted apothecary/pharmacy where the smell of grilled cheese permeates every corner. END
BEGIN NOW  I think the bar is ok. END
BEGIN NOW    I've been here many times so obviously it is good enough to come back to. END
BEGIN NOW    The reason for the two stars is that I've just experienced way better. END
BEGIN NOW    When I think about Dogwood, I think about a place that is just like any 'ol Mission hipster bar in the City but trying to not be that way because it is very "Oakland and proud" but, nonetheless, is just like a Mission hipster bar in the city. END
BEGIN NOW    The well drinks are watered down but the cocktails are good (and overpriced, just like any Mission hipster bar). END
BEGIN NOW   Except therein lies the problem, this is Oakland, not the City, so the bar would be better just being Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  I have found the bartenders to range from being very friendly to ratchet. END
BEGIN NOW   who would have thought?  Also, any bartender that doesn't know what is in a Cape Cod should not be working as a bartender (IMHO). END
BEGIN NOW  I'm a fan of the grilled cheese and cheese/meat plates which I do like and appreciate. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm sure I'll be back to this bar at some point but this isn't really a place I care to go to on the regular. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is ok if you don't mind paying those "new Oakland" prices and rub shoulders with the sf crowd, ooops, I mean new Oakland crowd that has taken over Downtown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  Service used to be pretty good but is now pretty bad, don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. END
BEGIN NOW  Drinks were decent, a little slow on service. END
BEGIN NOW    A bit pricey. END
BEGIN NOW  Would have given a better review if they had not doubled the tip i originally gave them. END
BEGIN NOW    Be careful with using your credit card here. END
BEGIN NOW  Had a nice, low-key evening at Dogwood on a Monday night!. END
BEGIN NOW  I came out to Oakland from SF to meet a friend, and loved that this place was a block away from the 19th St Oakland BART station. END
BEGIN NOW  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and basil, and it was absolutely delicious!  I also enjoyed my ginger beer cocktail, as well as a glass of wine. END
BEGIN NOW  The service was very friendly, though we did have to go up to the bar to place our orders. END
BEGIN NOW  The place wasn't too loud or busy on a Monday night, which made it a great atmosphere for catching up with an old friend. END
BEGIN NOW  The prices are reasonable too!. END
BEGIN NOW  I have visited this place many times, but I can't find myself to give a review. END
BEGIN NOW   I feel the place is too pretentious, pricy, and unfriendly bartender. END
BEGIN NOW   The only redeeming quality of the place is the grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   Not to mention very cramp. END
BEGIN NOW  I have since changed my mind. END
BEGIN NOW   I like the expansion and the food window. END
BEGIN NOW   More room, feel more friendly, and It feel more accepting. END
BEGIN NOW   Though, I was a bit tipsy because it was birthday. END
BEGIN NOW   I may have to check back again to give another try. END
BEGIN NOW  What I had: the bees knees, various grilled cheese sandwiches, pickled veggies. END
BEGIN NOW  Visit date: January 13, 2015. END
BEGIN NOW  First time? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW  Twas a fun evening at Dogwood. END
BEGIN NOW   I had the bees knees - it was a decent drink, sweet and sour. END
BEGIN NOW   What really stood out were the snacks! We had two kinds of grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW   One had tomato jam and the other had tomato and basil. END
BEGIN NOW   Both were excellent. END
BEGIN NOW   The bread had a crisp outside and soft inside. END
BEGIN NOW   The cheese was gooey and warm. END
BEGIN NOW   I have a special place in my tummy for tomato jam and Dogwood's was an A+. END
BEGIN NOW   The dijon dipping sauce added a nice touch, too. END
BEGIN NOW   So did the pickles. END
BEGIN NOW  There are plenty of seats around and open space to stand around or dance. END
BEGIN NOW   Order your food at the bar and they'll bring it out to you. END
BEGIN NOW  Another venue that endearingly screams "Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW  " This a long, narrow joint that somehow manages to pack in lots of people at the bar and in seated areas along the wall, all while featuring a dance stage in the back. END
BEGIN NOW   The setting feels old-school, almost Art Deco-ish. END
BEGIN NOW  The crowd is casual, friendly, and unpretentious, as is to be expected of Oakland, and there's a large menu of yummy cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Despite the fact that it can get busy on weekends, waits at the bar are never too long, and you can fit yourself in, whether with groups large or small. END
BEGIN NOW  've been to Three Fifty-Five twice in the last few years, and I enjoyed both visits. END
BEGIN NOW  The bar is a narrow space off of 19th Street. END
BEGIN NOW   There's a proper bar, followed by some tables and a dance floor in back. END
BEGIN NOW  The drink menu is good - and cheap! My wife and I both enjoyed two cocktails each on our most recent visit, and the price tag was around $8 or $9. END
BEGIN NOW  Service was friendly and efficient, which is welcome given that crowds start streaming in after nine. END
BEGIN NOW  I'd be back if I were looking for a more intimate bar in downtown Oakland (until it gets a little rowdier in the later hours). END
BEGIN NOW  You know, considering how Bar Three Fifty Five wasn't even our intended destination, I'd say our experience here was a pleasant surprise. END
BEGIN NOW    Not that I ever thought the place would be bad. END
BEGIN NOW    Not when, moments after checking in on Yelp, fellow Yelper Vi T. END
BEGIN NOW   commented, "good choice". END
BEGIN NOW    Talk about a stamp of approval!. END
BEGIN NOW  People have described the place as a nicer type of dive, and I guess I can kind of see that. END
BEGIN NOW    However, I'd say it's more like an old school bar (think Tosca Cafe in SF), what with its aged charm and decor (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW    There's still a bit of an Oakland vibe in the air though, and the small stage in back makes them pretty different in comparison, but that bar!  Love the look of it, as well as their slate of alcohol that fills their shelves and drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  The cocktail menu is short and sweet (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  com/biz_photos/bar-…), and not very expensive at $8 a pop (no wonder they're so beloved!). END
BEGIN NOW    Everything sounded great, but, on my friend's recommendation, I opted for the STARDUST REMEDY (Pimm's, Calvados, Ginger, Lime, and Falernum). END
BEGIN NOW    The name may sound child friendly, but this cocktail is definitely mature. END
BEGIN NOW    Balanced flavors with a decent pour, refreshing with some bite, and well-crafted by a bartender/mixologist that knows her stuff (yelp. END
BEGIN NOW  com/biz_photos/bar-…). END
BEGIN NOW  Since we arrived relatively early, snagging a table for the six of us was relatively easy, as was parking around the corner. END
BEGIN NOW    However, don't be surprised if the place gets packed to the gills as the night goes on. END
BEGIN NOW    As we were leaving, a steady stream of folks were filing in (it's just two blocks over from The Fox Theater). END
BEGIN NOW    Either way, Bar Three Fifty Five is worth a visit. END
BEGIN NOW  and one of my new favorite bars in Oakland!. END
BEGIN NOW  Great cocktails. END
BEGIN NOW   Dark and intimate venue. END
BEGIN NOW  good for a date spot if you're into it. END
BEGIN NOW   The crowd is hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW   Younger professional crowd around happy hour, older 30s to 40s crowd later in the night. END
BEGIN NOW  OMGGGGG the red hair bartender is the rudest person ever I have never been treated like THATTT!!!!!!!she was the RUDEST person ever!!!!!! I just asked for a tequila drink and just repplied with if u want I can make u a paloma as only option efortless cuz was 1 am. END
BEGIN NOW   I agreed she came with a poorly made "paloma" my peers tryed and said tasfted rotted as I thpughtttttt cuz was goss. END
BEGIN NOW   Gave it back telling her something was wrong I wanted a last word and OMG she started saying bad words and throw it in my face complaining. END
BEGIN NOW   Came back with a poorly made, of course. END
BEGIN NOW   "Last word" OMG WiTH ICE IN THE DRINKKKKKKKKK when this drink was served UP!!#!#!!!!! I work in the industry and I WOULDVE FIRED HER ASS IN THE SPOT. END
BEGIN NOW   Im a current customer and your are going to see my face often and return drinks if they are bad. END
BEGIN NOW   I dont know how you can call youself bartender. END
BEGIN NOW   Its not about knowledge or skills (missing on you, higly noticeable) you also need peolpe skills. END
BEGIN NOW  My food was burned and waaaaaay too over priced for what it is, sorry I hate to leave bad comments, but this is the third time in a row I have terrible. END
BEGIN NOW  food. END
BEGIN NOW  I'm very surprised that I have not written a review for 355. END
BEGIN NOW   I was here last night and it had been, possibly, a year and a half since I was last here. END
BEGIN NOW   Had a written a review of this, I probably would have given this place three stars. END
BEGIN NOW  The reason being, I never really cared too much for this place. END
BEGIN NOW   Every time I would come here in the past, it was because other people wanted to go here. END
BEGIN NOW   I just always thought they were trying WAY too hard with their cocktails and never wanted to come in here on my own accord. END
BEGIN NOW  Yesterday, the lovely Lorrayne suggested meeting here for drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   I was for it and since it had been so long since I was last here, I decided to give it another chance. END
BEGIN NOW   To my surprise, the menu changed. END
BEGIN NOW   It actually made sense and didn't give me a headache trying to look through it. END
BEGIN NOW   I tried their 19th Street Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW   It was good. END
BEGIN NOW   After that, I had to try their Gin & Housemade Tonic. END
BEGIN NOW   I love gin and I love gin & tonics. END
BEGIN NOW   Theirs was so good, I had three of them. END
BEGIN NOW   Lorrayne ordered a Dark & Stormy, which is also another one of my favorite drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   She let me have a taste. END
BEGIN NOW   It was very delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   It seems like they top theirs off with egg white and Lorrayne also informed me that they also make their ginger beer in house. END
BEGIN NOW  So I must give thanks to Lorrayne for actually making me interested in Bar 355. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll be back here, even if it's on my own. END
BEGIN NOW  There are definitely hipsters here but not the annoying ones that think listening to their grandparents songs on a gramophone is cool. END
BEGIN NOW  This place is the definition of great vibes! I love this place!. END
BEGIN NOW  Make Westing brings out a diverse and social crowd. END
BEGIN NOW   The music is low but still vibrant, which creates a great setting to mingle without screaming. END
BEGIN NOW   Feel free to get into an intense and fun game of bocce ball! Even standing around and watching is entertaining. END
BEGIN NOW   My friends and I meet and network with many amazing people all the time! Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. END
BEGIN NOW  Our go to drink is the FRENCH MUSE, a must have! It looks all cute and innocent, but it is slightly dangerous! 1 will have you in a chillin' mood, 2 tipsyyy, and 3 LIT!! You will feel like you have been drinking all night, which is pretty much drink goals! My limit is usually 3, I don't dare go past! I always have a great time here! Each element of Make Westing creates the perfect ambiance!. END
BEGIN NOW  This is definitely the spot to go for after work drinks, pre-games, or weekend hangouts! One of my favorite places in Oakland by far!. END
BEGIN NOW  Hipster bar alert. END
BEGIN NOW  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing. END
BEGIN NOW   For the most part, it has a comfortable, inviting environment. END
BEGIN NOW   The indoor bocce ball courts are a nice touch, but be prepared to wait a while until one opens up. END
BEGIN NOW   By the same token, don't take too long when you get a court!. END
BEGIN NOW  I took off a star because an employee was super rude to me for no particular reason. END
BEGIN NOW   He was clearing glasses from the bocce court area and was walking back toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I was inadvertently blocking his pathway, but instead of asking me politely to step to the side, he said in a sarcastic, annoyed tone, "It would help if you moved. END
BEGIN NOW  " Typically, that's not how you would want to treat your customers, but hey, they didn't ask me. END
BEGIN NOW  Been here a few times for drinks with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Cool hipster place in downtown Oakland, slow on Mondays and usually very busy Thursday-Saturday. END
BEGIN NOW  They make really good gimlets and mojitos. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartenders are friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   They have appetizers as well but I cannot rate them on that since I just go there for drinks, however the habanero popcorn looked really yummy the last time I was there. END
BEGIN NOW  Very chill place to mingle with the locals in the area, definitely a place you can wear tennis shoes or heels. END
BEGIN NOW   Recommend this place to anyone looking to go to watch the games or hang out with friends. END
BEGIN NOW  Braised oxtail sando!!!!!. END
BEGIN NOW  I was able to sample there Braised oxtail sandwich and let me say I will be back for more, not oily, not fatty, near perfection on a toasted bun. END
BEGIN NOW   The sandwich on a whole was a tad small, especially if you are sharing, but the meat was tender and flavorful, not to salty, more or less all around perfect on meat to bun proportion. END
BEGIN NOW  I also sampled the bone marrow dish, no skimming on this dish, full heavy amount of bone marrow on the bone, like most places that offer this dish you are scraping the bone to get every last bit, here the marrow was heavy, oily, thick consistency, throw it on some toasted bread that is offered and it is delicious, you can dip the bread in the sauce found underneath the bone, ohh man sooo good,. END
BEGIN NOW  I do recommend this place for the food, I did sample few beers, I would stay for there food that they offer. END
BEGIN NOW  food **** oxtail sandwich is a plus, bone marrow also a plus. END
BEGIN NOW  service **** no wait, walked up to the bar and ordered, received the food in 5 min. END
BEGIN NOW  price $$. END
BEGIN NOW  ambiance **** large venue, bochi ball not regulated size but folks compete here, allot of room to stretch your legs, better to go on a week night to avoid several crowds during the friday and saturday crowds. END
BEGIN NOW  I will be back for more oxtail and bone marrow. END
BEGIN NOW  Love Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW   Located in what is now Uptown Oakland. END
BEGIN NOW   Make Westing is serving up quality hand crafted cocktails from some of the most friendly bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW   What I enjoy most at Make Westing is the cheese selection. END
BEGIN NOW   Cow , Sheep or goat. END
BEGIN NOW   I always go for the cow and each time I fall in love. END
BEGIN NOW   Make Westing is serving Brie at its peak temp and they got it right. END
BEGIN NOW  Outdoor seating with views of the hustle and bustle of the city. END
BEGIN NOW   Old school tavern feel inside. END
BEGIN NOW   Indoor Bocce. END
BEGIN NOW   clean restrooms and comfortable seating. END
BEGIN NOW   Make Westing is definitely key for Oakland Nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW  I've had each of their house cocoktails and they are amazing. END
BEGIN NOW  I've visited this bar twice and both times I felt extremely uncomfortable and out of place. END
BEGIN NOW  After finding a seat at the bar, I was ignored by all three bartenders for atleast 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW   Eventually, I enthusiastically waved one of the bartenders down to get his attention. END
BEGIN NOW   When he finally acknowledged me, he seemed annoyed or bothered that I wanted to BUY a drink. END
BEGIN NOW  This bar seems to cater to a very specific crowd, which baffles me in the ever so diverse Bay Area of CA. END
BEGIN NOW  I never understand how customer service can be so bad and/or exclusive especially when they don't realize that they are offending patrons that are spending their money in these establishments. END
BEGIN NOW  I likely will never return to this place as long as it is the Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW  Interesting!. END
BEGIN NOW  This place has a special place in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW   It is where I first met my husband and where he later proposed. END
BEGIN NOW  I still haven't been able to persuade anyone to play bocce ball with me. END
BEGIN NOW   :(. END
BEGIN NOW  Here are the perks. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're usually a designated driver this place is still a lot of fun. END
BEGIN NOW   There is bocce and spicy popcorn to be had. END
BEGIN NOW    There are friendly bartenders who don't stank face you for not consuming alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW   They are bright enough to realize they can sell or give you something non alcoholic and that they can sell even more drinks to your pals who are imbibing. END
BEGIN NOW    They know the score!!! :). END
BEGIN NOW  After the office Christmas party I and a small handful of my coworkers still wanted to be out and about, so we made our way from The Lake Chalet over to Make Westing. END
BEGIN NOW   We somehow managed to grab a table with seats for all five of us in the incredibly packed place, and after perusing the menu of house cocktails I decided on a Garden Gimlet (gin, cucumber, basil, and lime). END
BEGIN NOW  I'm not a big drinker and have always had a hard time finding cocktails I like, but the Garden Gimlet was really refreshing and light. END
BEGIN NOW   Definitely recommend. END
BEGIN NOW  The bocce court was in full swing, the music was really good, and everyone seemed in good spirits. END
BEGIN NOW   It was loud but we could still have a conversation, and in general the atmosphere was really positive. END
BEGIN NOW   This is a cool place whether you're coming as a group or a couple, and I'd definitely like to come here again. END
BEGIN NOW  This is one of the least approachable bars on Telegraph. END
BEGIN NOW   I've eaten the food here, and ended up bloody from bones which were not removed from the meat. END
BEGIN NOW   I've also enjoyed myself here many times after work in previous years when it was comfortable, it's when they bring in the bouncers on weekend nights that you are asking to be treated poorly. END
BEGIN NOW   I would AVOID this bar until they hire more appropriate staff. END
BEGIN NOW   I would always love to support local business, but this place is not safe. END
BEGIN NOW  You'll notice the reviews are dropping on this place because its going down hill fast. END
BEGIN NOW   I would give it zero stars if I could after my recent visit. END
BEGIN NOW  You never know who you'll see at this bar!. END
BEGIN NOW  A group of friends met up here before the Allen Stone concert at The Fox Theatre, and low and behold, the man himself is hanging out at the bar with friends. END
BEGIN NOW   Super cool. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a typical laid back, casual, hipster bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Good prices, lots of space, and and nice bartenders. END
BEGIN NOW   I'd come back here before a show next time, too!. END
BEGIN NOW  The last three times I've been in Radio bar they've had this human body mutilation video on which is kind of disturbing, but you can ignore it by keeping your gaze ahead toward the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   What you can't ignore is the crazy loud music when it's cranked. END
BEGIN NOW   The latter is the only thing about this bar that I don't like, probably because I prefer to be able to hear what people are saying without having to scream WHAT? repeatedly only to give up and nod politely. END
BEGIN NOW  Drinks are cheap and the bar is dark. END
BEGIN NOW   Stools are comfortable, and occasionally there are patrons inside who compliment your teeth!. END
BEGIN NOW  perhaps other than the fact that it seems to attract a lot of. END
BEGIN NOW  If you don't like Radio then you are likely:. END
BEGIN NOW  a) a pretentious prick from the 'burbs or SF. END
BEGIN NOW  b) a hipster douche canoe who got lost on their way to Make Westing (much respect for MW bartenders, their evening crowd just sucks). END
BEGIN NOW  c) a whiny waste of space on this planet. END
BEGIN NOW  d) not friends with me, thank god. END
BEGIN NOW  Zhiva, Melissa, Marni and the rest of the Radio crew are some of the nicest, most real people you will meet in downtown. END
BEGIN NOW   If they don't like you, you are probably a jerk with attitude and they are hoping you leave so the rest of us don't have to deal with your dumb-shit vibe. END
BEGIN NOW  That said, drinks are always strong and always delicious. END
BEGIN NOW   Music is constantly changing so don't complain if you don't like it. END
BEGIN NOW   If you don't like dark red-lit places, you should move along. END
BEGIN NOW  If you can let your hair down with a bunch of nice people and don't want to get ripped off while you drink, this is your bar. END
BEGIN NOW  Cool Divey spot. END
BEGIN NOW   Very chill vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   Not sure where they got the Asian decor inspiration from, but the red lights do set a decent tone. END
BEGIN NOW   Bartenders were nice, service was good. END
BEGIN NOW  Definitely one of the nastiest bathrooms I've seen in my Day! Hah Kudos for that! Cheers!. END
BEGIN NOW  Meh. END
BEGIN NOW  It's a cool place to hang out, have drinks and listen to the DJ spin, but the bathrooms are hideous and the place is kind of small. END
BEGIN NOW   Dancing is out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks are good and the people seems cool. END
BEGIN NOW   It's just ok in my opinion. END
BEGIN NOW  Although I was the only person of Asian descent in the crowd here when I showed up, Radio appears to pay homage to its location near Chinatown by offering an intimate atmosphere that's not only lit dimly by lights in large red paper lanterns, but also punctuated by screens playing kung fu movies. END
BEGIN NOW  The atmosphere seems to be both loungey and dive bar-ish at the same time, while the overall vibe is friendly, approachable, and intimate. END
BEGIN NOW   I'll make a point of coming back and trying out some more of their drinks. END
BEGIN NOW  My friends and I were checking around Oakland for a good nightlife. END
BEGIN NOW   Being as its not the city we stumbled across Radio. END
BEGIN NOW   We went on a Friday night and the moment we got in we fell in love with the vibe and music. END
BEGIN NOW   Even though its small (since its a dive bar)  they have a good selection of alcohol. END
BEGIN NOW  If you're looking for drinks accompanied with good hip hop and the bay area hyphy vibe this is the place to go. END
BEGIN NOW  The place is tiny and cute- a little tight with the crowd it brings in but the atmosphere is loud and exciting. END
BEGIN NOW   The music bumps loudly and the bartenders are lively. END
BEGIN NOW   I was here via route bar hopping on Halloween night. END
BEGIN NOW   I really enjoyed the extra lighting and accent of the lanterns on the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW  The walls are lined with mirrors (which is a great idea for a small place), the bar expands most of the room, there is no dance floor but of course, no dance floor is no excuse not to shake your hips. END
BEGIN NOW   If you're lucky, you can find tables and seats in the back corner. END
BEGIN NOW  This is someplace I would def come back to check out on a night that isn't Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW   Fun!!. END
BEGIN NOW  This is a dark and divey bar with a pretty laid-back vibe. END
BEGIN NOW   It's narrow and sort of hard to move around much. END
BEGIN NOW   The bartender was cool and suggested a great cocktail for me when she found she didn't have all the ingredients for a Corpse Reviver #2. END
BEGIN NOW   My biggest complaint was the ladies room. END
BEGIN NOW   It was very tiny, not very clean, and the toilet was clogged. END
BEGIN NOW   I hope I would find it in better condition on my next visit. END
BEGIN NOW  Damn so I really loved this bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I was going a couple times a week (more like every day around 4 after work). END
BEGIN NOW   Will not be returning unfortunately. END
BEGIN NOW    I have been there at times and had an awesome experience with different bar tenders. END
BEGIN NOW    The long haired dude who drives a sick bike! Amazing and sooper nice. END
BEGIN NOW    This past 3 or 4 times I have always gotten service from a little ass hole of a chick. END
BEGIN NOW    First she's a jerk, 2nd,never smiles, and third she just has an unkind persona. END
BEGIN NOW    Like she doesn't want you there. END
BEGIN NOW  I go back at different times in hopes that she is NOT there but she is. END
BEGIN NOW  On several occasions she has not only been rude to me but my girlfriend as well. END
BEGIN NOW    Instances of refusing water because she's closing her register, or telling me to ask some one else in the most Dickish way. END
BEGIN NOW  Damn lady thanks to YOU you lost a loyal customer. END
BEGIN NOW    MAKE THAT TWO. END
BEGIN NOW  I used to always catch a last drink here before hopping on BART, so of them many times, a one drink stint is all I've really lingered for. END
BEGIN NOW    And to tell ya the troof, that is all I can really muster in here. END
BEGIN NOW  First, the place is thin and narrow, but long. END
BEGIN NOW    If you aren't lucky enough to get a seat at the bar (which is probable), then you have to plaster your back against the long wall. END
BEGIN NOW    And the space between the back of the stools and your face, is literally about 3 feet. END
BEGIN NOW    And in that 3 foot space is where the rest of the schleps will have to walk, back and forth in order to get to the rest rooms. END
BEGIN NOW  And to add to the insult, if it is a warm night, say 70's-80's, it will be 10-20 degrees warmer inside because I'm not sure if they have AC. END
BEGIN NOW    When the place fills up, all that body heat just compounds the problem. END
BEGIN NOW    I don't know how the bartenders are able to work in that heat. END
BEGIN NOW    Like clothes sticking to your skin. END
BEGIN NOW  heat. END
BEGIN NOW    Like, let's get outa here after this drink. END
BEGIN NOW  heat. END
BEGIN NOW  But outside of a few major logistical issues, this place is a dive in true form. END
BEGIN NOW    Decent cheap drinks, great music (must be from a shuffler cuz I didn't notice a juke) usually throwbacks of some sort. END
BEGIN NOW    Diverse crowd and quintessential dive bar lighting (red district red). END
BEGIN NOW    A drink here will evoke memories of intimate meetings of elaborate schemes of a devious nature. END
BEGIN NOW    But that's just me watching way too many Tarantino flicks. END
BEGIN NOW    Now if it can bring me there, then it can't be all bad, now can it?. END
BEGIN NOW  *throws in extra star*. END
BEGIN NOW  I want start this off by complimenting the bar itself I have always liked the environment and have felt invited to come in , I live in the area so I'm around the bar often. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm writing this review based on how I was treated twice upon trying to enter the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   I'm 22 with a baby face so u get carded (no problem with that) , I don't like how I was treated by one of the female staff who was completely rude and disrespectful to me because I don't look my age after I gave multiple forms of ID ,credit cards I  even showed a medical record and birth certificate  I should have never have had to go that far. END
BEGIN NOW   After being turned away by the woman my second time trying to enter the bar the same woman told me that she would only serve me if the bar next door would serve me , so I literally went there and I was served without hesitation after being carded she walked into the bar and asked the bartender if he was going to serve me he replied yes. END
BEGIN NOW   Then she se said to me ok well I'm still not serving you ,your not worth it your not worth me losing my job at the bar so drink here. END
BEGIN NOW   I told her that I didn't want to go there and asked her why she was treating me that way and she replied because u look too young I don't care what your I'd says. END
BEGIN NOW  I wish I had the name of the woman who was rude but unfortunately  I don't I feel the way she handled everything was wrong especially to turn a customer away to somewhere else just to come inside of that place where you do not work just  to turn them away is unprofessional and tacky. END
BEGIN NOW  OTHER THAN THIS INCIDENT ID SAY FIVE STAR TO THE BAR AND IT'S CREATED  ENVIRONMENT. END
BEGIN NOW  Coolish dive bar, but ultimately just a dive bar with some very red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW    I look at the entrace to this bar every day, since I can see it from my work, but this was my first venture inside. END
BEGIN NOW  The bartender was interesting and chatty, and the beer selection was OK. END
BEGIN NOW    The very red lighting I didn't care much for, but I guess that's its shtick. END
BEGIN NOW   Ultimtely though, to me, it's just another bar. END
BEGIN NOW    I'm not sure it'd be my first choice for after work - I might go to the Tribune instead which has a better beer selection, and food. END
BEGIN NOW  5 stars for the drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   They are strong and CHEAP. END
BEGIN NOW   $4 for a gin and tonic. END
BEGIN NOW   That's cheaper than a beer at most places!. END
BEGIN NOW  I went on a Friday night and the music was an interesting mix of early 2000's R&B  and some stuffs that I had never heard before. END
BEGIN NOW   It was sort of hit or miss. END
BEGIN NOW   It would start off with Shaggy "Wasn't Me" then would abruptly change to some tribal beat type deal. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe I'm ignorant to good music or not cultured. END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe cultured people enjoy the music more. END
BEGIN NOW   All I know is I'm most happy when old school Nelly is playing uninterrupted for the entire night but maybe that's just me. END
BEGIN NOW  Plea to the manager: PLEASE stop letting people in when the place is saturated. END
BEGIN NOW   The bar is tiny. END
BEGIN NOW   By 11 pm it was nearly impossible to move yet I noticed the bouncer letting more and more people in. END
BEGIN NOW   We ended up leaving because it was so crowded and hot and not worth it :/. END
BEGIN NOW  Still, I give the place the 4 stars because I like the laidback vibe, the cheap drinks, and the hip hop/R&B jams. END
BEGIN NOW  A hipsterish establishment that's super, super dark. END
BEGIN NOW   So dark, in fact, that you'd half expect to see the Milky Way galaxy hovering overhead as if you were on a middle school stargazing trek somewhere super remote. END
BEGIN NOW  But instead of worrying about zombies popping out of the forest like you did on those dark stargazing treks, you'll have to deal with, well, hipsters and other more borderline types, who for all you know could indeed be walking zombies after a drink or a joint or two. END
BEGIN NOW   The dim red lighting doesn't accentuate people's best features, and you never know if people are staring at you just because they're also having a hard time seeing, or if they really really are creepy. END
BEGIN NOW  I appreciate that there are divey places like this in Oakland, but I also appreciate that there are many other places in Oakland to choose from that are more happening and more my style. END
BEGIN NOW  I dig it here. END
BEGIN NOW   Cheap happy hour from 4-9pm, they have Manhattan (my kinda drink), Martini, Lemon drop and Margarita all for $5. END
BEGIN NOW   It's really dark when you first walk in but your eyes will adjust eventually and all you see is the red lighting. END
BEGIN NOW   There are pool tables all the way in the back but it's also where the smokers are which I'm not a fan of cigarette smoke so I stay away from there. END
BEGIN NOW   DJ plays music after 10 or something like that and there's a small dancefloor so it gets packed around that time. END
BEGIN NOW   Bartenders and security were pretty friendly. END
BEGIN NOW   I don't like that the bathroom only has one stall and can get pretty nasty but hey, it's to be expected at any bars right! It's a good spot to go to after work to decompress or meet up with friends for a good night and parking is always easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW  Hey, Bartender chick socializing with her friends with her back to me. END
BEGIN NOW   (For over 10 mins). END
BEGIN NOW  You suck and you're not as cool as you think. END
BEGIN NOW   You saw us and went about hooking your friends up with free drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   You should be fired. END
BEGIN NOW  As for the bar, loved the dingy vibe with the added hip hop. END
BEGIN NOW   Usually, dives like this play metal which is what I'm used to. END
BEGIN NOW  Too bad they didn't know who I was. END
BEGIN NOW  We didn't make it into the annual Autumn Lights Festival and were waiting in line in the cold with 1,000+ people. END
BEGIN NOW   We left and took a stroll on Lake Merrit and decided to continue the night in a better fashion. END
BEGIN NOW   We weren't sure what to expect and I didn't brush up on my Yelp reviews of this place, however, didn't think it was too bad of an idea. END
BEGIN NOW  We walked in and the place is completely dark. END
BEGIN NOW   You can literally piss or barf in the corner somewhere of at the bar, and no one would even notice it. END
BEGIN NOW   The light bulbs were all red tinted, which made the whole place blood red. END
BEGIN NOW   It's def. END
BEGIN NOW   appropriate for it's name. END
BEGIN NOW  and for Halloween. END
BEGIN NOW  There was no music that night, unfortunately, because drinking and dancing is always a great pair. END
BEGIN NOW   The drinks were cheap, the bartender was friendly, and clientele was "freakish". END
BEGIN NOW   Maybe it was just the lighting. END
BEGIN NOW   The place is small in size, not sure where the dance floor would have taken place if there was a DJ playing that night. END
BEGIN NOW  We grabbed drinks and headed to a closed off back side where pool and chain smoking took place. END
BEGIN NOW   The crowd was decent, mostly groups of friends hanging out. END
BEGIN NOW   However, the tables were mostly covered in grossness and the seats weren't too clean either, but it's a dive bar- that's how they get the label right?. END
BEGIN NOW  I can see this place as a good stop on a night of bar hopping, maybe to pre-game and have smokes indoors, but definitely not a place to just hang out at all night. END
BEGIN NOW  Horrible. END
BEGIN NOW   Requested fun  dance music for the ladies completely crowded AROUND the deserted dance floor. END
BEGIN NOW   The DJ  took a full 15 MIN to transition to dance party tunes that filled the dance floor for half an hour. END
BEGIN NOW    Everyone was so happy! Then the dirge of indulgent "ni**a ni**a blessed pu*sy" - you can't make this up, music that cleared the floor. END
BEGIN NOW   When asked WTF I was told there was a 'formula' to get people to the bar. END
BEGIN NOW   Horrible club. END
BEGIN NOW   Terrible drinks. END
BEGIN NOW   If you want to dance, look elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW   The DJ is faaaaaaaar too into himself to keep the peeps happy to dance :(. END
BEGIN NOW  Creepers creeping in a way too smokey room, and I'm a smoker. END
BEGIN NOW   Good music and good drinks though. END
BEGIN NOW  Great "dive bar"! Wouldn't have known about this place if I wasn't brought here. END
BEGIN NOW   No sign on the outside so you wouldn't think to come in. END
BEGIN NOW    So dark inside. END
BEGIN NOW   There is a smoking lounge (did we go back in time??) But you can stay clear of that and just hang by the bar and the front area, no detection of any smoke so no problem! Drinks are affordable. END
BEGIN NOW   Music is a throwback, but overall a good place to start/end the night!. END
