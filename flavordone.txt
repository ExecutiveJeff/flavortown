BEGIN NOW the wife of one of my great tennis pals back in Florence. END
BEGIN NOW She was big on mixing poultry and meats. END
BEGIN NOW Fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW So now we just break this up, let it brown a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Sweat out some bacon. render out the fat. END
BEGIN NOW Yep, and then I take the bacon out, I put the bacon in here. END
BEGIN NOW that's right. END
BEGIN NOW Add a little olive oil to the bacon fat. END
BEGIN NOW This is right up the lines of my Bolognese. END
BEGIN NOW Carrots, when the vegetables have softened a little bit, put in some chopped garlic, the real deal. END
BEGIN NOW So this is a little wine I make with a good pal of mine. really? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, ruby cabernet. we make it every year. END
BEGIN NOW Nothin' I don't like more than a little wine in some ground-up meat. END
BEGIN NOW now I'm gonna put some tomato paste in. END
BEGIN NOW some "ti-mo"-- thyme and rosemary combination. END
BEGIN NOW fresh, yes. END
BEGIN NOW let that do its thing for five, ten minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'm gonna put all the tomato paste mixture in with the meat. END
BEGIN NOW I throw in some water. no more tomato sauce? END
BEGIN NOW No more tomato. seriously? END
BEGIN NOW Yep. mine was a little bit different. END
BEGIN NOW This is meat times ten. raw chicken legs. END
BEGIN NOW Looks like voodoo Bolognese. END

BEGIN NOW After two hours, I take 'em out, I take the meat off, chop it up, throw the meat back in, and that's it. END
BEGIN NOW oh, those look so good raw. END
BEGIN NOW This would go for another hour now. END
BEGIN NOW And it's headin' for some homemade pasta. END

BEGIN NOW look at how that broke down. END
BEGIN NOW In? yes, in we go. END

BEGIN NOW The shrimp ravioli. END
BEGIN NOW In a little joint with only tables. END
BEGIN NOW We got about, square feet, I was gonna say END
BEGIN NOW It's quaint, it's fun. the food's great. END
BEGIN NOW From classics like spaghetti carbonara with END
BEGIN NOW to calamari braised all this food I learned from friends with the occasional rich twist. END
BEGIN NOW When I have the time, I try to do something that I haven't been doing--a different dessert or a different dish. END
BEGIN NOW pork shanks out of it. END
BEGIN NOW I tried the pork, and people are loving it. END
BEGIN NOW Just a little salt, and I'm gonna add pepper. END
BEGIN NOW on that. well, there's a lot going on here. END
BEGIN NOW Right, so now we're gonna lightly flour these. END
BEGIN NOW Just on the ends, huh? yeah. hot pan. END
BEGIN NOW All right, you put a little sear on the top and the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW About three, four minutes on a side. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, the little crust. END
BEGIN NOW All right, I'm down with where we are. END
BEGIN NOW gonna sauté my vegetables. yeah, I love the red onion. END
BEGIN NOW Did you see that getting used predominantly in Italy? END
BEGIN NOW In Florence. where I was-- only red onion. END
BEGIN NOW bit. celery. END
BEGIN NOW see the droopy eyes? END
BEGIN NOW A little salt and pepper, throw in some garlic, my favorite--rosemary and thyme--I just love that. END
BEGIN NOW I give it a stir. END
BEGIN NOW I'm just gonna put a little bit down on the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm just gonna put the osso bucco on top. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna put the rest of the vegetables in, just everywhere. it's like garden madness. END
BEGIN NOW It is. a little tomato sauce? END
BEGIN NOW A little tomato sauce. so far, so great. END
BEGIN NOW A little wine. oh. degrees for how long? END
BEGIN NOW Two and a half hours. I can't wait. END
BEGIN NOW Nuggets of happiness. END
BEGIN NOW I can just touch it and just see it's falling-- pan's hot. END
BEGIN NOW Came out of the oven. oh. END
BEGIN NOW complements this? yes. END
BEGIN NOW A little oil, a little lemon, a little parsley. END
BEGIN NOW We put the pasta in, give this a toss. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that fresh pasta just rocks. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. beautiful drippings. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the way it just pulls right away from that bone. END
BEGIN NOW Anytime you can cook the meat next to that big of a bone, the flavor's gotta be just intense. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. wow. END
BEGIN NOW That's so super flavor. oh, man. END
BEGIN NOW I never had it with pork shanks before. no? END
BEGIN NOW Wow, what a treat, and a little bit of the mirepoix-- the carrots and the celery-- really nice. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Italy. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW it is always really good. END
BEGIN NOW always just really nice coming back here. END
BEGIN NOW We know we're gonna get a good meal, AND WE'RE GONNA ENJOY OURSELVES. (all) CHIN Chin. END
BEGIN NOW It's a total dream. I love the clientele. END
BEGIN NOW So much fun and satisfying. END
BEGIN NOW I think that's the musician in you. END
BEGIN NOW This time you're just playing your masterpiece on the canvas of the plate. thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW I'm out on that. END
BEGIN NOW diner and adobe. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Santa Fe. END
BEGIN NOW great green chile here. END
BEGIN NOW right away. END
BEGIN NOW Means corned beef hash with a southwestern kick. END
BEGIN NOW and off he goes with the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW Take things as they come? END
BEGIN NOW I've got an idea. END
BEGIN NOW Or improvise? END
BEGIN NOW So check it out-- by now, we're all pretty familiar with diners, right? END
BEGIN NOW Comfort food, made by great people, family environment, eclectic menus-- now in jersey, it's all about the stainless steel diner, but in Santa Fe., New Mexico-- well, welcome to the adobe diner. END
BEGIN NOW You gotta check out Zia. END
BEGIN NOW comfort food, southwestern style. END
BEGIN NOW fries. uh-huh. END
BEGIN NOW Avocado gazpacho. fabulous. END
BEGIN NOW Smoked salmon quesadilla. love it, man. END
BEGIN NOW Jodi, you're up! and all the diner classics. END
BEGIN NOW fish-and-chips, king. END
BEGIN NOW Diner gone wild. diner gone wild. END
BEGIN NOW table. END
BEGIN NOW very fresh. END
BEGIN NOW And almost totally from scratch, like organic chicken-fried steak, you had me at hello on this. END
BEGIN NOW it's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Quesadilla. so how are we gonna do this? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make a rub with equal parts salt, a little cayenne, so you get a little bit of heat there. END
BEGIN NOW That's my measuring technique-- we've got onion powder, garlic powder. END
BEGIN NOW Mix it up, and it goes right onto the salmon. END
BEGIN NOW Hitting it with a little bit of lime juice. END
BEGIN NOW And we're not gonna go to a smoker. END
BEGIN NOW we just put a bunch of hickory chips in here, put a little bit of water, steam pan insert, get a nice little seal on there and over here it goes. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. and then quesa-dill-ia time. END
BEGIN NOW So the salmon is done. good lookin'. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm, great. so how do we make one of these? END
BEGIN NOW but a nice, thick flour tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW And then we putasadero cheese on this. what--asadero? END
BEGIN NOW Asadero is a Mexican melting cheese. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think? good texture to it. END
BEGIN NOW Some caramelized shallots and our smoked salmon. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] GENEROUS PORTION. END
BEGIN NOW And now this is gonna go into the pizza oven. END
BEGIN NOW Just about three minutes. three minutes. END
BEGIN NOW There's our nice melted asadero cheese, and we are going to slice up some avocado to put on that, there we go, and let's cut that big boy up. END
BEGIN NOW This is a sweet red chile sauce we make. END
BEGIN NOW (giggles) That's outstanding. isn't that good? END
BEGIN NOW That is a balance of flavors that complement each other so well. END
BEGIN NOW You put some nice heat on it--mmm-- then you bring the sweetness in from the caramelized shallots. END
BEGIN NOW that cheese has got some nice saltiness to it. END
BEGIN NOW And the creaminess of the avocado-- I'm really glad you like it. END
BEGIN NOW Every time I come in here, I think, I'm gonna eat something else, and I end up eating the salmon. END
BEGIN NOW Same thing again. every time. END
BEGIN NOW With that smoked flavor of the salmon with a little bit of heat--love it, man. END
BEGIN NOW we've got an asiago with vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW We buy it from the farmer's market in the summer. END
BEGIN NOW We buy all of our beef from a ranch all of the beef that you're using here in Zia. they're organic, they’re grass-fed. END
BEGIN NOW love their burgers. END
BEGIN NOW the meatloaf is the best. END
BEGIN NOW Even the homemade corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW Any time someone is brining and doing yep. END
BEGIN NOW thyme. END
BEGIN NOW and a little of my favorite-- the juniper berries. END
BEGIN NOW I dig it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna put some spice rub down, and then our brisket. END
BEGIN NOW we get much better penetration if you're not using a big, thick piece of meat. END
BEGIN NOW So now we're gonna wrap it up. END
BEGIN NOW Now you do want to weight this down. END
BEGIN NOW Put the heavy tin cans on there, and then-- in the walk-in it goes. END
BEGIN NOW holds it END
BEGIN NOW Yep. wow. END
BEGIN NOW first we rinse it, 'cause there's an awful lot of salt on there. END
BEGIN NOW Then it goes into the pot. END
BEGIN NOW We just put enough water in there to cover it. END
BEGIN NOW Put in some carrots, some celery and onion. END
BEGIN NOW pull it out, let it cool and then tear into it. END
BEGIN NOW We chop it. okay, like this? END
BEGIN NOW Inch? that's it. that's beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW We put the potatoes and the onion in first. okay. END
BEGIN NOW we let that cook for a little while. END
BEGIN NOW yeah. END
BEGIN NOW So I kind of under-salt this. END
BEGIN NOW So we'll go ahead and put a little pepper, and then we put the corned beef in at the last minute. END
BEGIN NOW But now what is that over there on that part of the wall? END
BEGIN NOW oh, they moved it. never mind. END
BEGIN NOW Are you ready to taste it? I'm ready to rock. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. smells killer. mmm. END
BEGIN NOW That corned beef just carries its own flavor, and that really is good beef, too, you're right. it's good beef. END
BEGIN NOW There's enough juice going on with it, do you want to put a little green chile in there? END
BEGIN NOW I hope I'm not breaking any, you know, rules here in the international brotherhood END
BEGIN NOW Uh-huh. is what makes that. END
BEGIN NOW you can't come to New Mexico and not eat our green chile. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, what's that over there? END
BEGIN NOW And off he goes with the corned beef hash. END
BEGIN NOW How's the hash today? it's good. END
BEGIN NOW I mixed a little green chile into mine and oh. oh. END
BEGIN NOW are my green enchiladas almost ready? END
BEGIN NOW Everything that I've had here tastes great. END
BEGIN NOW and Beth’s always thinkin' of something new. END
BEGIN NOW We just want to keep kind of up in the game. END
BEGIN NOW Like an ahi tuna sandwich with mango salsa, green chile eggs Benedict and a totally fresh END
BEGIN NOW Corn and avocado gazpacho. END
BEGIN NOW it's like cold guacamole soup. END
BEGIN NOW When we come back. mmm, that's really nice. END
BEGIN NOW at the Zia. diner in Santa END
BEGIN NOW We've got one salmon quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW Beth draiscol's doing it all her way. END
BEGIN NOW Diner and adobe. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW mixin' up the END
BEGIN NOW with southwest standards. END
BEGIN NOW one of my favorites is the green chile cheese fries. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. where's that been all my diet? END
BEGIN NOW And for the gazpacho, she's only using what's fresh, local and in season. END
BEGIN NOW Avocado corn-- it's fabulous. END
BEGIN NOW It's like guacamole soup. very, very good. END
BEGIN NOW all right, so give me a rundown. END
BEGIN NOW So we're gonna take some yellow squash and zucchini, red bell peppers and onions, and we're gonna put those into the robot coupe and pulse that up. END
BEGIN NOW So that's your texture. END
BEGIN NOW okay. END
BEGIN NOW Straight from the farmers' market yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Finely diced roman tomatoes, cilantro, gotta have a little heat in there. END
BEGIN NOW And then we put a bunch a bit on the chunkier side. END
BEGIN NOW this takes quite a bit of salt 'cause those avocados are pretty mild. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW we'll put a little pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Now we just let that sit there for a minute while we go ahead and make our avocado purée. END
BEGIN NOW Some ice water. END
BEGIN NOW we just want it to be cold the minute it's done. END
BEGIN NOW you hold, I'll scrape. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, and now we put a bunch more water in here, and then we're gonna just whisk it up really well. END
BEGIN NOW Would you like to taste it? absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. get the lemon juice right off the top. END
BEGIN NOW We get good corn in northern New Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. END
BEGIN NOW You know what else I like, is that it's not so cold-- that you really can taste the tomato-- everybody's kind of bright in there. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. that's really nice. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna sit here and finish this because this is really good. it's fabulous. END
BEGIN NOW you can't beat it. END
BEGIN NOW How's dinner tonight? oh, it's wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW got your chicken here, kiddo. END
BEGIN NOW good down-home, Americana-type food. END
BEGIN NOW And lots of Santa Fe. cuisine. END
BEGIN NOW yeah, I do love what I do. END

BEGIN NOW that's all right here right now END
BEGIN NOW When I say, "Kansas City," you're probably thinkin' steak or barbecue, but not on this trip. END
BEGIN NOW Today I'm thinkin' something else, like an old auto-parts-store- turned-restaurant run by a transplanted, east-coaster sculptor where the place and the food are both off the hook-- a place like grinders. END
BEGIN NOW Check your attitude at the door, is what we say. END
BEGIN NOW Here you go. END
BEGIN NOW That's wings! END
BEGIN NOW Holdin' down. END
BEGIN NOW His name is stretch. I'm a very big man. END

BEGIN NOW yeah, well, it's stretch--the food is stretch-a-licious. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. the pizza is just my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW with all kinds of homemade END
BEGIN NOW Man, this is like being in grade school again. END
BEGIN NOW Cheesesteaks stretch insists END
BEGIN NOW I'm from Philly area. END
BEGIN NOW I think I can make a cheese steak wherever I go in the world. END
BEGIN NOW your eyeballs are sweatin'. END
BEGIN NOW In a hundred-year-old building with food END
BEGIN NOW and monster metal sculptures in the back. END
BEGIN NOW weighs about, pounds. END
BEGIN NOW no crazier than stretch deciding it makes perfect sense for a sculptor to open a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW (Stretch) ART LIKE FOOD LIKE MUSIC Crosses all cultural boundaries. it does. END
BEGIN NOW And this place is just all that put together, END
BEGIN NOW (Stretch) THAT'S OUR PIE RIGHT THERE. STARTING Entirely from scratch. END
BEGIN NOW You just work your fingers into it, but I gotta tell ya, he’s putting more time into one skin than I've seen other people let me see this thing. END
BEGIN NOW I can almost see through it. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I can't wait to have this. END
BEGIN NOW I say we make our famous Bengal tiger. END
BEGIN NOW you know, we got this chicken in there, and the tandoori sauce. END
BEGIN NOW It's got curry in it and stuff like that. END
BEGIN NOW Little pesto goes down. END
BEGIN NOW That's the little pesto. END
BEGIN NOW curry-- now how does this go over here in, uh, in the heart of the beef land? END
BEGIN NOW people love it. END
BEGIN NOW It's even got a little crab on it and hearts of palm. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause I often, when I'm thinkin' pizza, and we sprinkle a little of our cheese on top, and that's about it right there. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think? that is gorgeous. END
BEGIN NOW So cilantro. cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW Just drip it in there a little bit like that. END
BEGIN NOW Bengal tiger. rawr! END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW That's like an all-calypso- jazz-band-festival, funkalicious rock concert. I hear it's good. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious-- you get, like, these gems, little hearts of palm, a little bit of the chicken, some crab. it's the yin and the yang of pizza. END
BEGIN NOW stretch'll make anything work. END
BEGIN NOW (woman) I LOVE IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN KIND OF Specialty order it. END
BEGIN NOW Like, you get your own slice and decide what's on it. END
BEGIN NOW IN ANY COMBINATION. (Stretch) SO WE'RE Gonna put some salmon on here now. END
BEGIN NOW Like smoked salmon and cream cheese on pesto. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! END
BEGIN NOW there's one with spinach, peppers, artichokes, olives and almonds-- four kinds together with the pepperoni next to the pineapple. END
BEGIN NOW And this baby that makes you wonder END
BEGIN NOW The chili and the onions-- fresh-cut onions-- the surprise is the tater tot. END
BEGIN NOW So this pie actually has a hole out of the center of it, and we put tater tots in the middle. END
BEGIN NOW We put chili on top of it, cheez whiz on top of that, and then we put some green onions on top of that. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Tasty chili. mmm, and you know what? END
BEGIN NOW Nothin' goes better than a tot. END
BEGIN NOW Food is always just great. END
BEGIN NOW And while stretch started this as an artist, END
BEGIN NOW It's just like your own little mini art gallery. END
BEGIN NOW And it changes. people bring us stuff. END
BEGIN NOW when it comes to the food, HE GOT REAL SERIOUS REAL QUICK. (Guy) LOOK At that. END
BEGIN NOW (Stretch) I HAD A FRIEND WHO WENT TO NEW York at the culinary institute up there. END
BEGIN NOW He came back and helped me open a restaurant, nice, okay. END
BEGIN NOW so that's why you've really got some true culinary foundation. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW But there's also the stuff that stretch brought to the party. END
BEGIN NOW I used to live in Philadelphia, and this is the first place that's exactly the same the secret is definitely seasoning the grill beforehand. END
BEGIN NOW We've thrown bacon on there all day long and cheese steak, so it's gonna be fine. END
BEGIN NOW Nice, lean roast beef we use. END
BEGIN NOW Chop it up. END
BEGIN NOW The other secret is slicin' the bun. END
BEGIN NOW You don't want to go all the way through. END
BEGIN NOW Peppers first, then put a little onions on there. END
BEGIN NOW Mix it in there. END
BEGIN NOW Put my cheez whiz on here. END
BEGIN NOW That's a Philly cheese steak in Kansas City. END
BEGIN NOW Cheers. bon appétit. END
BEGIN NOW That's tasty. END
BEGIN NOW That's good eats right there, man. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as you think you got it pegged, grinders throws you another curve ball. END
BEGIN NOW One of the best things you got here is George. END
BEGIN NOW the Hungarian delight? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. do you officially work here? END
BEGIN NOW Or is this kind of just, like, community service? END
BEGIN NOW It is pro bono. END
BEGIN NOW George is stretch's long-time friend, a retired restaurateur who comes in once a week to do Hungarian specialties like chicken paprika. END
BEGIN NOW EXCELLENT. (Guy) SO YOU'VE KNOWN TO COME Here for this. END

BEGIN NOW just before it's done, George. tosses in some mushrooms I always put parmesan cheese on it. END
BEGIN NOW Will this do? that is fantastic, man. END
BEGIN NOW So here I am in cape may, exit 0, the last exit on the garden state parkway. END
BEGIN NOW Now this shore town is known for its Victorian homes and as a great family vacation destination. END
BEGIN NOW Now right in the middle of it all, on the corner of beach and Perry, is a 42-year-old neighborhood joint that's serving up breakfast, lunch, and dinner with a little Greek twist. END
BEGIN NOW This is George's place. END
BEGIN NOW how's it going? END
BEGIN NOW You good? END
BEGIN NOW pass it down when it's ready. END
BEGIN NOW The karapanagiotis brothers, doing what a lot of Greek families do come November. END

BEGIN NOW In the oven3 1/2 hours. 400 degrees. END
BEGIN NOW Pull it out. and then take off the foil. END
BEGIN NOW Let it brown. caramelize the outside of it. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful roasted leg of lamb. END
BEGIN NOW just slice a little bit down for you. END
BEGIN NOW Go right onto the flattop grill, no oil or nothin'. a little sear on it. END
BEGIN NOW While that does its thing, put our roasted red pepper and eggplant orzo. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of like a staple starch. END
BEGIN NOW tzatziki sauce of course you need that on the side. END
BEGIN NOW It's a lemon, oregano, olive oil gotta tell you, man, tasty dish. END
BEGIN NOW That's about as Greek as they come, bro. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Made the right way, and the lemon, garlic, olive oil yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Forget about it. does it? nice. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, really nice. thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Great job, bro. thank you very much. END

BEGIN NOW You like that? yeah. END
BEGIN NOW he's always loving and fun. END
BEGIN NOW is the service here any good? END
BEGIN NOW Since he took over for his father in-law George. didn't realize how much I liked the Greek food, before john changed the menu. END
BEGIN NOW Put a little more Greek influence to it. END
BEGIN NOW all OPA! END
BEGIN NOW And put his brother Pete in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW bell dings a blend of his END

BEGIN NOW there's a smoked fig ketchup on top Peter's special recipe. END
BEGIN NOW enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW I need a turkey END
BEGIN NOW He's got his own take on the American classic. END
BEGIN NOW You think you're getting turkey and stuffing, and what you're getting is a whole lot more. END
BEGIN NOW Turkey confit. END
BEGIN NOW Submerged in duck fat. it's great. END
BEGIN NOW Where did you come up with this idea? END
BEGIN NOW Thanksgiving came around, and was like, what else why not turkey confit? so how do we start this? END
BEGIN NOW A little kosher salt running through the food processor. a little? END
BEGIN NOW tarragon, rosemary, parsley. Italian flat-leaf. END
BEGIN NOW making? green salt. END
BEGIN NOW Green salt. there you go. END
BEGIN NOW it's like a savory snow cone. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that is awesome. I am so stealing this. END
BEGIN NOW That green salt right there is gonna get rubbed on the turkey breast? yes, it is. END
BEGIN NOW Skin on and everything? yep, skin on. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to put too much on there, 'cause then it's gonna get over-salted. END
BEGIN NOW Put this in the fridge for two to three hours, back into the fridge for 24 hours, and then we go to the confit. that's correct. END
BEGIN NOW Submerge these turkey breasts into duck fat. END
BEGIN NOW I like this. END
BEGIN NOW A cross between deep-frying and poaching. END
BEGIN NOW In the oven at 250 for 3 hours. yes. END
BEGIN NOW And what are we gonna serve this with? END
BEGIN NOW Corn bread and andouille sausage stuffing. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. corn bread for the stuffing. END
BEGIN NOW Cornmeal, all-purpose flour, baking soda. END
BEGIN NOW Baking soda and baking powder. END
BEGIN NOW gives it two different leavening times. END
BEGIN NOW Sugar, kosher salt, a little blended olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW That's Italian olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Four eggs, buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW So all of this corn bread effort is just to make corn bread to make into stuffing? END
BEGIN NOW Correct. END
BEGIN NOW That was quick. very nice. END
BEGIN NOW Pop it in the oven. 25 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Pull it out, let it cool, then we flip it out. END
BEGIN NOW take out some pieces, and just, large breaks. END
BEGIN NOW Pour it right onto a sheet pan. END
BEGIN NOW Back in the oven 15 minutes? yep. END
BEGIN NOW Now it's time to make the savory for the stuffing. END
BEGIN NOW Blended oil. not sure if it's Italian or Greek. END
BEGIN NOW Put that right in there. andouille sausage. END
BEGIN NOW Cook the andouille down. END
BEGIN NOW You want to get that flavor in the oil. END
BEGIN NOW Spanish onions, green pepper, celery, carrots, garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Greek oregano. Greek oregano, yes. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. all right, over here? I gotcha. END
BEGIN NOW cool it down, END
BEGIN NOW Gets 'em in there real quick, stirs 'em up and then our corn bread. END
BEGIN NOW they turn into full-on crouton el nugget-o's. END
BEGIN NOW Suck in all that chicken stock. END
BEGIN NOW Now we go onto another tray. END
BEGIN NOW How long are we gonna go in the oven? END
BEGIN NOW About 20, 25 minutes, get it brown on the top. all right, turkey breast. END
BEGIN NOW We'll just break off a big piece. END
BEGIN NOW We're just getting it a little bit darker on the one side. END
BEGIN NOW hey, Pete, somebody at the door! END
BEGIN NOW it's not super ducky. END
BEGIN NOW That's not what it's quacked up to be. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get that stuffing. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. let's give it a quick slice. END
BEGIN NOW Piece right there right on the center, turkey coming off the grill, right on there with it. END
BEGIN NOW And finally, cranberries simple syrup and a little bit of honey, put a spin on the classics. END
BEGIN NOW This is definitely a turkey dinner gone wild. END
BEGIN NOW Nice. END
BEGIN NOW Savory, sweet, salty, then you get the acid from the cranberry. END
BEGIN NOW You've got that complexity. it's very contemporary. END
BEGIN NOW It's got its components of old school with what I will honestly say, dude, is the bomb dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Turkey confit. the turkey is just so tender. END
BEGIN NOW woman TASTES LIKE IT'S BEEN BASTING IN The oven forever. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffing really adds a little bit of spiciness. END
BEGIN NOW pick up, lamb chops. END
BEGIN NOW I know what you're doing right now. END
BEGIN NOW You're writing this down, because you're gonna go buy 2 gallons of duck fat. END
BEGIN NOW Thanksgiving will never be the same at your house after hanging out with this guy. END
BEGIN NOW Turkey dinner. END
BEGIN NOW now I'm gonna get our oysters prepped. END
BEGIN NOW That's not something you see everyday. END
BEGIN NOW Is going big easy. really taste the oysters. END

BEGIN NOW Hit 'em into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. END
BEGIN NOW Chill 'em down, yes, and we'll hold 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Then when we're ready we'll go ahead and sear 'em off into some butter. END
BEGIN NOW We found that by searing it you can get that crunch again off of that casing. END
BEGIN NOW I think we've got this one sautéed up. END
BEGIN NOW We just let it sit in clarified butter. END
BEGIN NOW Let's make it. END
BEGIN NOW Sausage, a little garlic aioli, very green relish. END
BEGIN NOW The neon. END
BEGIN NOW For a little Asian flare we have some pickled daikon relish. END
BEGIN NOW , good lobster. END
BEGIN NOW There's good texture to it, the relish and the daikon play in for a little crunch. END
BEGIN NOW But I will tell you, if you want to have a unique dog experience that's the dog you want. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job, man. beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW It's to die for. END
BEGIN NOW Just the most tasty hotdog I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW Andouille dogs. I want to try all of them. END
BEGIN NOW So 60 seconds on the polish. END
BEGIN NOW This is my number one spot. END
BEGIN NOW Watch out, the hotdog king right here. END
BEGIN NOW The captain of encased meats. END
BEGIN NOW Next up we're going to a party where they're roasting a pig in the ground. END
BEGIN NOW this is the real stuff. END
BEGIN NOW It's luau time when we get back. END
BEGIN NOW So when we decided to visit Hawaii on diners, drive-ins, and dives one thing we had to check out was a luau. END
BEGIN NOW So I guess now you can call it triple d so here we are, time to hit the beach at Germaine's luau. END
BEGIN NOW It's all about the party, which is a ton of fun. END
BEGIN NOW Guy Even WHEN YOU LIVE ON THE ISLAND YOU Still come to a luau? END
BEGIN NOW I still come to a luau. END
BEGIN NOW AND THIS ONE'S THE REAL DEAL. IT IS So amazing. END
BEGIN NOW WHERE THE LOCALS GO. END
BEGIN NOW I am from Hawaii; this is the real stuff. END
BEGIN NOW AND THE CENTERPIECE OF ANY GOOD LUAU END
BEGIN NOW Just pork. kalua pig. END
BEGIN NOW They cook it in an imu which is underground. END
BEGIN NOW Place the pig into the imu for about eight hours. END
BEGIN NOW the pit is called the imu. END
BEGIN NOW SCOTT HARADA SHOULD KNOW. END
BEGIN NOW His family's business Marian's catering has been doing luaus at Germaine's for over 30 years. END
BEGIN NOW thank you very much. END
BEGIN NOW You split it down the center, open it up so you can get all the smoke into here and the temperature in here. END
BEGIN NOW couple of hours ago. END
BEGIN NOW It takes about two hours for the rocks to come up to temperature. END
BEGIN NOW So the charcoal goes away, the rocks stay super hot. END
BEGIN NOW I dig it, let's see it. END
BEGIN NOW Scott SO WE'VE GOT MIKE COMING IN WITH Hawaiian sea salt, salt that's dried out from the ocean water over here. END
BEGIN NOW So they're generous with it. very generous. END
BEGIN NOW Now what's gonna happen? END
BEGIN NOW Some of these hot rocks are gonna be placed in the cavity of the pig. END
BEGIN NOW We can cook it from the outside in as well as from the inside out. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you can hear the fat snapping and popping. END
BEGIN NOW It smells good, huh guy? it smells fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW So he's getting a new piece of chicken wire. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna bring in the stalk of the banana tree. END
BEGIN NOW It holds a lot of high-water content so that's what we use to impart flavor as well as the moisture. END
BEGIN NOW NOW THE CHICKEN WIRE. WE'LL PLACE THE Pig on top. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa, that almost didn't fit. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna put the larger pieces of banana stump over Otto seal it up from the top. END
BEGIN NOW He's gonna build a little house. right. END
BEGIN NOW Now we go with the leaves, a wet burlap sack. END
BEGIN NOW This is a modern day implementation. END
BEGIN NOW It seals much better. END
BEGIN NOW Traditionally it was all banana leaves on top. END
BEGIN NOW We will also lay our final tarp over it. END
BEGIN NOW Wow, a lot of work, anything go up on top of this? END
BEGIN NOW It will be completely covered with sand. END
BEGIN NOW Eight hours. eight hours of love. END
BEGIN NOW Eight hours, better be some good pig. yes. END
BEGIN NOW Is there a ceremony when this comes out? yes. END
BEGIN NOW Luau host 'EKAHI ONE, 'ELUA TWO, 'Ekolu three, okay, kalua pua'a. END
BEGIN NOW Ladies and gentlemen, there you have it, our Hawaiian-steamed pig. END
BEGIN NOW I've roasted some pig, but I've never seen it just disintegrate like that. END
BEGIN NOW I like how you show up at the last minute. END
BEGIN NOW the good-looking guys get the hard work. END
BEGIN NOW I'll try that right there. END
BEGIN NOW , that's great. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of sea salt on it, nice subtle flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, it's killer, you guys are gonna like this. END
BEGIN NOW woman THE SMOKINESS THAT COMES THROUGH Is so incredible. END
BEGIN NOW The best ever. END
BEGIN NOW The food is great, I ate a little bit of everything. END
BEGIN NOW Amazing food and amazing hula dancers. END
BEGIN NOW Being on the beach, seeing people out here enjoying themselves. END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't get any better. it's home. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice, great job. all right. END
BEGIN NOW So that's it for the triple d Hawaiian vacation. END
BEGIN NOW Time for me to head back to the mainland, pick up the Camaro and hit the road looking for more of America's greatest diners, drive-ins, and dives. END
BEGIN NOW 'Til next time, aloha. END
BEGIN NOW woman WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN YOU REALLY CRAVE SOMETHING, RIGHT? man Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW well, I just had to have pizza now. END
BEGIN NOW I thought you liked that pizza from that show, YEAH. I DO. BUT A. B. 's CRUST well, yeah, but his crust is really good. END
BEGIN NOW It's chewy and puffy, but tonight, I want crisp and thin and kind of charred, like the pizza we had in Italy, remember? END
BEGIN NOW Actually, he's more like a goober, you know, with all the puppets and the science and everything. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, his dough has to rise, like, all night, and I require instant pizza gratification. END
BEGIN NOW  END
BEGIN NOW high voice YOUR PATIENCE WILL BE REWARDED, Okay, honey? shut up. END
BEGIN NOW I'm happy to report that the conversation you just overheard never really took place. END
BEGIN NOW It was a dramatization, a fabrication, a hypothetical unlikelihood. END
BEGIN NOW But let's face it, it could happen, right? END
BEGIN NOW I mean, true, the original good eats pizza is tasty, it's chewy, yeasty AND, YES, PUFFY LIKE PANTS IN THE '80s, And I'm willing to admit that man cannot thrive on one pizza alone. END
BEGIN NOW It is conceivable that one might desire a crisp, thin pizza in the Neapolitan style with, you know, bits of mahogany char and, yeah, you you might want it fast. END
BEGIN NOW Well, fine, so that we can be certain that this scene never plays out in reality, we will strive to fold the aforementioned characteristics END
BEGIN NOW shivering WHEN IT COMES TO YEAST-LEAVENED Breads like pizza dough, I've always been a fan of the long, cold dough rise, because cold decelerates the life cycle of yeast so that they produce flavor compounds and OF COURSE belching Co2 at a slower, more even pace allowing the dough more time to absorb the goodness. END
BEGIN NOW That said, there might just be one particular ingredient that we can invite to the party THAT MIGHT GRANT US SLOW-RISE FLAVORS belching At fast-rise rates, not to mention temperatures. END
BEGIN NOW EW. shivering Let's get our dough on. END
BEGIN NOW , flour go into the work bowl of your favorite stand mixer. END
BEGIN NOW Now I know what some of you are thinking. END
BEGIN NOW You're thinking, hey, he's making a yeast bread. END
BEGIN NOW He's gonna need some, you know, high protein. END
BEGIN NOW He needs to use, like, bread flour. END
BEGIN NOW And if I was going with a really long rise period or if I was trying to create a big puffy loaf, I would probably concur. END
BEGIN NOW But what I want here is pliancy and speed, so I'm going with plain old lower-protein all-purpose flour. END
BEGIN NOW To that, we will add one standard envelope of instant or rapid rise yeast. END
BEGIN NOW 25 teaspoons or 7 grams for the metrically minded. END
BEGIN NOW Now in this case, instant or rapid refers to the speed at which the yeast get to work. END
BEGIN NOW Now let's just review a couple of common forms here. END
BEGIN NOW This is cake yeast, not because it's used in cakes, but because it comes in a cake form. END
BEGIN NOW And this is like a big live colony 70% water by weight. END
BEGIN NOW And the yeast that are inside are alive and kicking, wide awake and ready to go. END
BEGIN NOW Problem is extremely perishable stuff, which is why back in, I don't know, early 20th century, people switched over to active dry yeast. END
BEGIN NOW Now to make this, you dry up the little bugs in such a way as to basically encapsulate live cells inside tiny little pods composed of dead yeasts blech! END
BEGIN NOW And when dissolved in water, the dead ones wash away and the living emerge phoenix-like from suspended animation. END
BEGIN NOW I don't much care for active dry yeast, because it has to be soaked or proofed in warm water before use, and I'm too lazy to mess with that. END
BEGIN NOW And all too often, you find that the yeast inside just aren't very robust, and they take a LONG TIME. belching To get any dough blown that's just pathetic. END
BEGIN NOW Instant or rapid rise yeast are processed differently so that there are more live yeast involved in the equation. END
BEGIN NOW And since they're packaged with a dash of citric or ascorbic acid vitamin c they get a little boost RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. belching They are wide awake ready to blow. END
BEGIN NOW HA HA HA HA! balloon deflating They don't have to be soaked before they go into battle, which is nice. END
BEGIN NOW Now to the flour and yeast, a tablespoon of salt, and yes, you can dump that right on top of the yeast, not matter what your old culinary school instructor told you. END
BEGIN NOW Then the wet works 10 ounces of warm water, say, about 105 degrees. END
BEGIN NOW That will provide the requisite moisture and the warmth needed to wake up the yeast. END
BEGIN NOW We're also going to add 2 tablespoons of olive oil for flavor and lubrication. END
BEGIN NOW And then my secret ingredient 1 tablespoon of malted barley syrup. END
BEGIN NOW Barley syrup is made by malting barley. END
BEGIN NOW All right, step one allow the barley to sprout or germinate in water. END
BEGIN NOW Germination sets enzymes into motion, which convert the grain's starch reserves into a double-glucose sugar called maltose. END
BEGIN NOW The grain is then kiln-dried and mixed with water, as well as other cooked grain products, which are gobbled up by the enzyme. END
BEGIN NOW Then a slurry is extracted, and this is boiled down into a syrup. END
BEGIN NOW Although malt syrup could be made in the home environment, buying it in the jar is ever so much more convenient. END
BEGIN NOW 12 hours at 250. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Now what are we making? END
BEGIN NOW All right, we're taking our date barbecue sauce. Date? END
BEGIN NOW I had some dates one day, and I was like, You know, I'm gonna thicken a barbecue sauce with it make it a little bit different. I'm telling you it's good. END
BEGIN NOW This is when the funky of the folk come out. END
BEGIN NOW Dried dates. END
BEGIN NOW Dry guajillo peppers with a little bit of the heat. END
BEGIN NOW Big old chuck of garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Chili powder. END
BEGIN NOW Brown sugar, cumin. END
BEGIN NOW Rice wine vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of water. END
BEGIN NOW Cook it for about 10 minutes, till it comes up to a nice boil. END
BEGIN NOW Throw it in our blender and blend it up. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Take our big old slices of white bread. END
BEGIN NOW Take our pork straight off in nice, big chunks. END
BEGIN NOW Piece of Gruyere cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Few caramelized onions. END
BEGIN NOW And this is our date barbecue sauce, which you're very interested in. END
BEGIN NOW Date barbecue sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of our collard-green coleslaw goes on there. END
BEGIN NOW And we top it. END
BEGIN NOW Another petit diet sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW Just like the meatball burger had its own unique identity, the same thing with this sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW You get the tang coming out of the raw onion and the slaw. END
BEGIN NOW The pork's got its own, you know, barbecuey flavor, a little bit of that smoky coming through, and a little bit of sweet, but not as much sweet as I anticipated END
BEGIN NOW with the date. END
BEGIN NOW It's got so much going on. END
BEGIN NOW It's a great sandwich, man. Sweet, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW And the bad to the bone. END
BEGIN NOW Nice tangy sauce. END
BEGIN NOW There's some heat in it. END
BEGIN NOW It's creamy, it's rich. END
BEGIN NOW It's really something different. END
BEGIN NOW Pork verde table two. Let's pick it up. END
BEGIN NOW The food's perfect when you come here. END
BEGIN NOW Just a great place all the way around. END
BEGIN NOW Fantastic and unique. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Well done, brother. Thanks, Guy. END
BEGIN NOW Coming up, in Denver, Colorado END
BEGIN NOW That is outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW a place cooking up killer curry END
BEGIN NOW This is tikka masala gone wild. END
BEGIN NOW served with a side of heat. END
BEGIN NOW A little fire in the belly. END
BEGIN NOW This is the pursuit of perfection. END
BEGIN NOW So, I'm here in the Rhino district of Denver, Colorado, just a few blocks away from where the Rockies play. END
BEGIN NOW Now, I have everybody and their mother sending me recommendations for Triple D, but when my buddy Frank Matson, who happens to be the owner of Citizen Pictures, the executive producer of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, say, Hey, Guy, I got a place you've got to check out, END
BEGIN NOW well, enough said. END
BEGIN NOW This I Biju's Little Curry Shop. END
BEGIN NOW Coconut curry chicken it is. END
BEGIN NOW The freshest Indian food I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW Beef with biriyani, that sounds excellent. END
BEGIN NOW It's a completely different cuisine that you're used to when you think of India food. END
BEGIN NOW This is Frank Matson. END
BEGIN NOW Frank and I have been buddies for a long time, and he said this is a joint you got to see. END
BEGIN NOW What makes it so special? END
BEGIN NOW Biju is just making really great-tasting food that's healthy for you, too. END
BEGIN NOW The kind of food the owner Biju Thomas specializes in, as a personal chef for pro athletes, and now he's bringing it to the masses. END
BEGIN NOW Is this fast food? Is this END
BEGIN NOW Fast casual. So, people come through the line here. END
BEGIN NOW We walk them through every step. END
BEGIN NOW Everything's in a bowl. END
BEGIN NOW Everything's either rice or as a salad. END
BEGIN NOW You've got chicken, beef, or vegetarian combo. END
BEGIN NOW That's pretty much everything. That's it. END
BEGIN NOW They have so many options here. END
BEGIN NOW The spicy beef over rice. END
BEGIN NOW I usually get the biriyani rice with the vindaloo chicken. END
BEGIN NOW The chicken vindaloo over the yucca. END
BEGIN NOW If you look at south Indian food, every dish starts exactly the same with a fresh curry base, mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, chilies. END
BEGIN NOW Really? Fresh curry leaves. END
BEGIN NOW This goes into everything. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Fresh curry leaves? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know that I've ever smelled curry leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, this is the It's like pandas eat this. END
BEGIN NOW Basically [laughter] I mean, it's bitter on the palate, but it's got an awesome smell. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna chop all this up. END
BEGIN NOW We got some red onions. Little bit of garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Some ginger. Serranos and jalapeños. END
BEGIN NOW Wow, there's a little Latin spin coming out there. END
BEGIN NOW Grab some fresh curry leaves and fresh cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW We can start basically any of our sauces we want. END
BEGIN NOW This is the foundation? Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW And then from that, we can take that into any different direction with the beef or the chicken anything at all we want to go to. Okay, next up? END
BEGIN NOW This is our basic dry spice mix curry vindaloo. END
BEGIN NOW Vindaloo is a spicy curry. END
BEGIN NOW Toasted coriander. END
BEGIN NOW Coriander is the base for a lot of the curries. END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of neutral, it's not too peppery. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of lemon. END
BEGIN NOW Then we have some toasted fennel. END
BEGIN NOW Black peppercorns. END
BEGIN NOW Big peppercorns. END
BEGIN NOW Curry leaves. The dry version. END
BEGIN NOW Cumin seeds. m. END
BEGIN NOW These are not toasted Black mustard seeds. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet paprika. END
BEGIN NOW So, we go with a ton of that in there. END
BEGIN NOW Turmeric. Also for color. END
BEGIN NOW Turmeric is one of the heavy colors in Indian food, correct? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. We finish with some extra-hot Indian ground pepper. END
BEGIN NOW All of that? Yeah, we want it to be hot. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so now we grind it END
BEGIN NOW That's it. Now we're gonna cook the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW I always work with chicken thigh. END
BEGIN NOW It has a little bit more substance. END
BEGIN NOW The chicken thigh is done. END
BEGIN NOW A little oil in the pan. Right. END
BEGIN NOW Some chicken. END
BEGIN NOW We got a little salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW While that's happening, I'm gonna start our vindaloo sauce. END
BEGIN NOW A little oil. END
BEGIN NOW Let me taste this, by the day. END
BEGIN NOW Is it gonna be hot? Gonna be a little peppery. END
BEGIN NOW Not too crazy. Good, right? END
BEGIN NOW It's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW Spice mix. END
BEGIN NOW That's for one dish? END
BEGIN NOW That's the one dish. END
BEGIN NOW You know, when you get curry mix powder at home, people use like a teaspoon. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody uses a teaspoon. That doesn't do anything. END
BEGIN NOW Our chopped curry base. END
BEGIN NOW Smells good, though, right? END
BEGIN NOW It smells fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, tamarind paste. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Nice sweetness, a little of that tang. END
BEGIN NOW Give it another stir. END
BEGIN NOW Some fresh lemon juice Wow. END
BEGIN NOW That's fresh-squeezed lemon. END
BEGIN NOW distilled white vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW This is crazy. END
BEGIN NOW Give it a nice sprinkle of salt. END
BEGIN NOW Gorgeous look at that. END
BEGIN NOW You've done this before. END
BEGIN NOW And a little agua? END
BEGIN NOW A little water to give it a little sauce. END
BEGIN NOW That good? Beautiful, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW And you let that tighten up. END
BEGIN NOW Is this now where we should be? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Oh. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so the chicken gets nice and tender. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, so this gets combined, then we have the curry. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna plate it up. END
BEGIN NOW So, normally, we'd come off the line, so I'll just do it. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna start with some chicken vindaloo. END
BEGIN NOW That's how much you get? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you get chicken vindaloo. END
BEGIN NOW You add some yucca. END
BEGIN NOW Yucca put too much on. END
BEGIN NOW THOMAS: I'm gonna put a little bit of slaw in here. END
BEGIN NOW And then I'm gonna put some of our Ardicheri because you wanted it to be extra hot. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't say that at all. END
BEGIN NOW That little nugget of death right there. END
BEGIN NOW Are you kidding me, dude? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that's good. END
BEGIN NOW Fantastic flavor, right? END
BEGIN NOW Nice tang, nice acid. END
BEGIN NOW There's tons of different textures going on. END
BEGIN NOW This is tikka masala gone wild. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of spice. END
BEGIN NOW I will admit I got a little bit of a sweat brow going. END
BEGIN NOW You see the sweat coming on? END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I just want more of it. END
BEGIN NOW Brother, I am telling you this is better than good. END
BEGIN NOW I can understand why my boy Frank sent me here. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken vindaloo and yucca. END
BEGIN NOW Fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW Just big chunks of chicken. END
BEGIN NOW There's all kinds of vegetables so it's crunchy. END
BEGIN NOW Not too saucy. It's fresh, it's tasty. END
BEGIN NOW It's definitely got some spice to it that I wasn't quite ready for. END
BEGIN NOW I'm tearing up a little bit. [laughs] And if heat's not your thing END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I come in, I don't feel like that much spice, I can tone it down You can always kick it up a notch with two or three different types of spices. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make next? END
BEGIN NOW THOMAS: Beautiful, bright curried beef. END
BEGIN NOW I'm hanging out here in Denver, Colorado, with a crazy named Biju. END
BEGIN NOW When we come back, it's another outstanding dish. END
BEGIN NOW Biriyani with beef It's really unique. END
BEGIN NOW It's something that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of curry. END
BEGIN NOW you sell sweatpants? [laughter] See you in a minute. END
BEGIN NOW Just tap it. END
BEGIN NOW I did! END
BEGIN NOW All right, here we are back in Denver. END
BEGIN NOW Ii I've finished my bowl of vindaloo. END
BEGIN NOW I had a small nap, and now we're into another fantastic dish. END
BEGIN NOW something Biju Thomas has a knack for Indian food for active folks like the athletes he used to cook for. END
BEGIN NOW In the last 10 years, I've focused mostly in the cycling and sports world. END
BEGIN NOW Including one who just happens to be a buddy of mine from my home town Santa Rosa, pro cyclist Levi Leipheimer. END
BEGIN NOW You know this cat right here? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, Levi. END
BEGIN NOW I need you to sign off on this guy. Is he the real deal? END
BEGIN NOW He sort of straddles that line between gourmet cooking and fuel for getting out there and doing your best performance, but it tastes great. END
BEGIN NOW Cat get any better sign-f than that. END
BEGIN NOW This food is so different from other Indian food. END
BEGIN NOW It's layers of flavor. It's real ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW It's complex, and I think that's the genius that Biju's brought here. END
BEGIN NOW What's your favorite dish? I think the curried beef. END
BEGIN NOW It's a cinnamon garlic braised beef. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome curried beef. That's what this is. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna put a little oil in the pan. END
BEGIN NOW This is chuck. Norris? As in Norris. END
BEGIN NOW A bit of salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW So you're just gonna sear that off. Next step? END
BEGIN NOW Just like with the vindaloo, we have our beef curry mix. END
BEGIN NOW And that goes in. END
BEGIN NOW I just can’t believe the amount of spice that goes into it. END
BEGIN NOW That's what make the difference. END
BEGIN NOW The spicier we make it, the more people love it. END
BEGIN NOW This is our curry base. And this, too, you know, you're not shy about how much you put in there. END
BEGIN NOW That, roast them together. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna add a little bit of water and let this simmer for about 90 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW At the very end, we have a little bit of ground cinnamon, some ground cayenne, coriander. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna make the Samandhi. END
BEGIN NOW Samandhi is our roasted coconut and dry red chili chutney. END
BEGIN NOW Chili? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW These guys will be nice and hot. END
BEGIN NOW I always like when my chilies outweigh all the other ingredients nine to one. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW What is this called? Guy Fieri, This Was Your Life? END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] I'm gonna start with a little bit of coconut oil and mustard seeds. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh curry leaves your favorite. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of minced garlic, ginger, a little tamarind. END
BEGIN NOW Smells awesome so far. END
BEGIN NOW Onions. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh coconut comes from India. END
BEGIN NOW So then we add our chilies. END
BEGIN NOW This is the most chilies I've ever seen go into one sauce this size. END
BEGIN NOW Go for it. Do it all. There you go. END
BEGIN NOW So, we roast that off, toast it till the peppers start to burn a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW There it is. Crazy. END
BEGIN NOW And we're ready for the blender. END
BEGIN NOW Adding a little bit of water and salt. END
BEGIN NOW That's our Samandhi base. END
BEGIN NOW Wow, that looks hot. END
BEGIN NOW So we start with our biriyani, which is a fruit nut rice. END
BEGIN NOW Lentils, beef. END
BEGIN NOW We got a little bit of slaw. Got some Thai chilies. END
BEGIN NOW The radishes and jalapeños. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of lemon juice. END
BEGIN NOW And salt. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's our slaw. Indians don't do that. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is not an Indian side, doing the slaw? END
BEGIN NOW That's totally something I borrowed. END
BEGIN NOW This is the ground-coconut Samandhi that we just made. END
BEGIN NOW I'll have a bowl of Samandhi, please. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, it would be great on anything. END
BEGIN NOW That is outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW Not too much heat by any means It just has so much going on. END
BEGIN NOW Then you get a touch of the sweetness of the coconut, and then you get the richness of the beef. END
BEGIN NOW little acidity of that slaw. END
BEGIN NOW Put a little fire in the belly. END
BEGIN NOW Wake you up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Biriyani with beef. It's really intense flavors. END
BEGIN NOW There's huge chunks of beef. END
BEGIN NOW My favorite part, actually, is the slaw. END
BEGIN NOW It just adds a lot of good, fresh flavor in there. END
BEGIN NOW It's been a great experience so far, I think it's so awesome here. END
BEGIN NOW This is the place to go in Denver. END
BEGIN NOW When my buddy, Frank, told me about this place, I said, You know, I'll check it out. You didn't let me down, man. END
BEGIN NOW Nice. Real deal. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, buddy. Real deal. END
BEGIN NOW You got to come see this no question Coming up, we're headed just outside of downtown END
BEGIN NOW I like that. END
BEGIN NOW to a funky Brazilian bistro. END
BEGIN NOW What a dish. END
BEGIN NOW that's blowing up flavor combos. END
BEGIN NOW Let me look around. END
BEGIN NOW There might be something you didn't put in there. END
BEGIN NOW about career, and you want to earn an advanced degree. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here on the north side of Denver, Colorado, just a few minutes from downtown, and I'm right around the corner from Tocabe. END
BEGIN NOW You remember that place, right? END
BEGIN NOW They made the fantastic salsa with the hominy? END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, believe it or not, right down the street, a funky little joint, this is Fe Brazil. END
BEGIN NOW The food is 100% intense. END
BEGIN NOW arlinga speaking Portuguese Everything is really fresh. END
BEGIN NOW The ingredients taste like they just came out of the garden. END
BEGIN NOW And just like they came out of Brazil. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty much. END
BEGIN NOW All right. Chili. END
BEGIN NOW Help yourself to some fixin's. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. I'm a sour cream guy. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW Little cheese. END
BEGIN NOW I'm definitely a lot-of-onion guy. END
BEGIN NOW And a little cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and I got to have some corn nuts. END
BEGIN NOW I've never seen that. END
BEGIN NOW That's good chili. END
BEGIN NOW You can make it the way you want it. END
BEGIN NOW I like the little corn-nut crunch in there. END
BEGIN NOW I love the tub. Goes along with it great. END
BEGIN NOW You have a personality about it. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, it's worth coming down just to see the road show. END
BEGIN NOW This is what makes coming to L. A. beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW You can have funky, little joints just like this doing rockin' business. END
BEGIN NOW Dynamite. Dynamite chili. END
BEGIN NOW SS Turkey Drive over bread tub. END
BEGIN NOW The texture of it and the flavor, it's just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW For those that need a fix in the middle of the night, we have frozen boil bags. END
BEGIN NOW He does not miss a beat. END
BEGIN NOW You always know it's gonna be fun coming in the door. END
BEGIN NOW The number-one thing for chili go ahead and grab that. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] Now you can make Tub's chili. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I'll tell you, partner. END
BEGIN NOW next on the menu END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna make you a Double-Barrel Dingo Dog. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know to take him seriously. END
BEGIN NOW Is there such a thing? Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Double-Barrel Dingo Dog fully loaded! END
BEGIN NOW That right there says gym membership, doesn't it? END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] When we come back. END
BEGIN NOW Triple D has rustled some culinary gold in Culver City, California END
BEGIN NOW Yee-haw! END
BEGIN NOW at Tub's Fine Chili, where the homestead's run by Rancher Rick END
BEGIN NOW Wild West Tub. END
BEGIN NOW and his wife, Boss Mama. END
BEGIN NOW There's your Chuck Wagon with your buffalo chips. END
BEGIN NOW How would you explain this to people? END
BEGIN NOW It's, like, the best. chili any way you want it. END
BEGIN NOW With a rep like that, you know they've got to have a killer chili dog. END
BEGIN NOW Double-Barrel Dingo Dog. Yee-haw. END
BEGIN NOW It is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW Rancher Rick, what are we up to now? END
BEGIN NOW We're making the buns for our Double-Barrel Dingo Dog. END
BEGIN NOW Double-Barrel Dingo Dog. END
BEGIN NOW Right. So, we're making cornbread? END
BEGIN NOW Cornbread. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW Wet our bowl with some soda water. Keeps it nice and light. END

BEGIN NOW This is Mert's Heart and Soul. END
BEGIN NOW It's definitely comfort food. END
BEGIN NOW T Creoles all day. END
BEGIN NOW It's like eating at home, or better than what I can get at home. END
BEGIN NOW Just like my mama cooks. She just put her foot in it. END
BEGIN NOW But Dad's the one doing the cooking here chef and owner James Bazzelle, who's been bringing down-home to downtown since 1998. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a treasure chest in the middle of the asphalt jungle. END
BEGIN NOW That's what's so special about it. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't expect this downtown. END
BEGIN NOW What kind of food do you guys serve here? END
BEGIN NOW Low Country and Southern. And Southern. END
BEGIN NOW I think it tastes like something that my grandma would cook. END
BEGIN NOW Soul Rolls up. END
BEGIN NOW The Soul Rolls are everything you'd ever want out of the South. END
BEGIN NOW Goodness wrapped and deep-fried. END
BEGIN NOW Soul Rolls. END
BEGIN NOW Got to have a Soul Roll. All right, well, get into it. END
BEGIN NOW Collard greens cut them up. END

BEGIN NOW We take these to the fryer, cook them off, 350. END
BEGIN NOW Then we just take them, and we cut them. END
BEGIN NOW Drizzle a little spicy honey-mustard. END
BEGIN NOW Then we do a little bit more garnish on them. END
BEGIN NOW So, most folks can't make it to Mert's without having a Soul Roll? END
BEGIN NOW We try not to let them leave without having a Soul Roll. END
BEGIN NOW That's astronaut soul food. END
BEGIN NOW You know how they send the astronauts their food all prepared and ready to go? Yeah, yeah, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW This is a soul-food missile pop. END
BEGIN NOW This comes with everything combined in one easy-to-eat bite. END

BEGIN NOW You guys ready to eat? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW The Soul Roll's got everything I like. END

BEGIN NOW Oh, yeah. I'm a grit-eating fool. END
BEGIN NOW I start with cold water, margarine, and my favorite grits are these yellow, organic, stone grits. END
BEGIN NOW Whisk them in. Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW And the thing about grits you got to keep stirring them so they do not stick together. END
BEGIN NOW got you there. END
BEGIN NOW Some salt, cream just makes it taste so good. END

BEGIN NOW The grits got to be a little toothsome. END
BEGIN NOW Can't be too soggy. No. END
BEGIN NOW Got to have a little bite to them. END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna have to pry this out of my hand. END
BEGIN NOW  END
BEGIN NOW Shrimp and grits on. END
BEGIN NOW This is one of my favorite things on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW I do try to duplicate it when I get home, but it doesn't come out the same. END
BEGIN NOW Did you grow up eating this type of food? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. My grandmother's from South Carolina. END
BEGIN NOW Did she put her foot in it? END
BEGIN NOW She put her foot and love in it. And this obviously has both. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody from out of town I bring here. END

BEGIN NOW That's how she's gonna bake? Just like that. END
BEGIN NOW about 13 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Mm Last but not least? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add some of the hot gravy to a roux. END
BEGIN NOW It's almost solid. You throw the warm stuff on it. END
BEGIN NOW Mix her up. Get the whisk to it. END
BEGIN NOW Turns to a nice slurry. END
BEGIN NOW All right, back in. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] So, now this is just gonna thicken up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW This is one of the funkiest red-eye gravies we have ever seen in the history of Triple Here's our biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW I think to do this the right way, I'm gonna try to load it up with all of the bacon, the sausage, and the prime rib. END
BEGIN NOW ! Juicy meat, great texture, little bit of salt, little bit of sweetness, really nice biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW Super coffee flavor. Coffee leads here. END
BEGIN NOW This is Crazytown next to Flavortown. END
BEGIN NOW The more you eat it, the more it grows on you. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Mm! END
BEGIN NOW The beef in it is just to die for. END
BEGIN NOW I don't even like coffee, but I really love the espresso in it. END
BEGIN NOW And the biscuits are light and fluffy and fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW This is the kind of place that you root for. END
BEGIN NOW This is the experience you have to have. END
BEGIN NOW If you think this is unique and interesting and adventurous, wait till you try the END
BEGIN NOW Jalapeño hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna love them. END
BEGIN NOW Guy Fieri: That’s when we come back. END
BEGIN NOW Li's the food that brings us together. END
BEGIN NOW And kitchens where every meal is the most important of the day. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome back, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives in Delta, Wisconsin, and let me introduce you to the wild, wild west family of the Liautauds. END
BEGIN NOW That would be my buddy, Jimmy John Liautaud. END
BEGIN NOW That's right the dude from Jimmy John's Sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're hanging out here at the Delta Diner, a place that I discovered with this crazy family a year ago, and now Triple D is finally here. END
BEGIN NOW This is Big Jim. END
BEGIN NOW did you find it, or did Jimmy find it? END
BEGIN NOW I think I found it. You think you found it? END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We had some fantastic red-eye gravy made with more coffee grounds than should ever be put into any dish. END
BEGIN NOW It was outstanding, and it just gets crazy from here. END
BEGIN NOW Pancakes with jalapeños. END
BEGIN NOW It sounds crazy, but they're awesome. END
BEGIN NOW Yep, you heard it right jalapeño hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous. So let's get it going. END
BEGIN NOW We'll start out with the gravy. END
BEGIN NOW All-purpose flour. END
BEGIN NOW Sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Baking powder. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of cinnamon and salt All right, just mix this together. END
BEGIN NOW Set it aside. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW That's a lot of egg, baby. END
BEGIN NOW Mix those up. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy, can you pour the vanilla? END
BEGIN NOW Are you helping now? END
BEGIN NOW I'm helping. All right! END
BEGIN NOW This is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW Milk. END
BEGIN NOW Want me to stir this for you? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Jimmy. You know how to cook. END
BEGIN NOW All right. There we go. END
BEGIN NOW Just keep her going. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy and his family have this great little cabin that we goo ever year. END
BEGIN NOW And we were hanging out one day, and Jimmy says, I'm gonna take you to this great diner. Then I have this Norwegian pancake, so I knew that we would be coming back here. END
BEGIN NOW Melted butter. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of butter, and this makes what I would call a not very thick batter. END
BEGIN NOW No. It's gonna be thin. END
BEGIN NOW It goes in a container, goes in the fridge. END
BEGIN NOW We've had a chance for the pancake batter to rest. END
BEGIN NOW Onto the griddle? This is it. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see it. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Now you're gonna throw on chopped pickled jalapeño. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. END
BEGIN NOW This does not look like it should work at all. END
BEGIN NOW Now you smell the jalapeños starting to caramelize a little bit on the grill. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna sprinkle the powdered sugar on it All right, so, everybody, here's what you do. END
BEGIN NOW Grab that lemon. END
BEGIN NOW Squeeze it around on top of that. END
BEGIN NOW Why this works, I do not know. END
BEGIN NOW I don't say it very often, but this is probably in the top three best pancakes I've ever had on Triple D, if not the best. END
BEGIN NOW It's tender. It's light. It's thin. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of think about it like a crepe gone wild. END
BEGIN NOW And it is sweet. That's a sweet batter. END
BEGIN NOW It's nice and eggy. END
BEGIN NOW And the lemon and the sugar just cut the hot perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW It's an amazing combination. END
BEGIN NOW Leslie Liautaud, what do you think? END
BEGIN NOW The jalapeño is not hot. It's savory. END
BEGIN NOW so you get a perfect savory and sweet mixture. END
BEGIN NOW I get caught between texture and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW They're both vying for all your attention. END
BEGIN NOW It's really just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't expect it to be this great. END
BEGIN NOW It's worth a special journey to get here. END
BEGIN NOW So, there you are, in the real-deal diner in the middle of nowhere. END
BEGIN NOW Adios! END
BEGIN NOW Coming up, in Duluth, Minnesota END
BEGIN NOW That is thick and dense. END
BEGIN NOW doing-it-all Italian spot END
BEGIN NOW All day long. END
BEGIN NOW serving it up family-style. END
BEGIN NOW So, it's full-on Brady Bunch. after today I can offer you no interest for months. END
BEGIN NOW If you've been watching Triple D for a while, you know I'm a huge fan of Italian markets. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I don't know what it is. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it's my heritage. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it's the fact that you can go in, it's part grocery store and part deli and you can get a little snack or a little Italian specialty. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, the list goes on and on. END
BEGIN NOW So, I'm here in the Spirit Valley neighborhood right outside of Duluth, Minnesota, to check out a joint where a family is doing that and more. END
BEGIN NOW This is Gannucci's Italian Market. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken Parm and a porchetta, table 6. END
BEGIN NOW Everything is homemade here. END
BEGIN NOW Meatball sub and muffaletta. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW It's family-owned. END
BEGIN NOW It's been in the family for a while. END
BEGIN NOW That would be since 1978, and the running the ship since 2011 is owner and chef Billy Kalligher. END
BEGIN NOW So, now, your family works here? Your kids work here, as well? END
BEGIN NOW Yep, my wife, my son, my daughters, yep. END
BEGIN NOW How many daughters do you have? END
BEGIN NOW Six. What? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW And a son? Three. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. just makes you feel like you're at home. END
BEGIN NOW Got a lasagna for table 4. END
BEGIN NOW This lasagna ranks as one of the best that I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of good layer good cheese. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, what are we gonna make first? END
BEGIN NOW Make Italian sausage for lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get after it, then. All right. END
BEGIN NOW I have a pork butt. Cut up in pieces. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm gonna feed it through the grinder, grind away. END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm ready to season it up. END
BEGIN NOW In goes the ground pork. END
BEGIN NOW I add water, salt, granulated garlic, fennel seed. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW And some ground anise seed. END
BEGIN NOW How long will you cook this down? Just until it's brown. END
BEGIN NOW Smells awesome. END
BEGIN NOW What are we up to now? END
BEGIN NOW Pasta. Beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW The dough's ready to be rolled out. Here we go. END
BEGIN NOW A little flour down. END
BEGIN NOW Roll it out. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, you can work some dough. END
BEGIN NOW Cut it up. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna boil these for about 30 seconds. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, once they're done, in some cold water. END
BEGIN NOW Not completely cooked, though. END
BEGIN NOW Nope. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, now I'm going to assemble my lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW First our homemade marinara. END
BEGIN NOW Noodles in. END
BEGIN NOW marinara on top of that. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'm going to put my Italian sausage down. END
BEGIN NOW That is great Italian sausage. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Top it with some cheese and then build another layer. END
BEGIN NOW More sauce. More sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Some good Romano on it, more sausage, and this will be the last layer. END
BEGIN NOW Three layers? Three layers. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna cook this off in the oven. END
BEGIN NOW What temp? END
BEGIN NOW About 275, 300, just to bring it up the temp and melt the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna be out in 45 minutes? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW That is thick and dense. END
BEGIN NOW Low-cal. END
BEGIN NOW Low-cal lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW What I like is, it's simple, it's completely balanced, little saltiness from that Romano cheese. END
BEGIN NOW The kind of lasagna I wanted as a kid was noodle, noodle, noodle, noodle, noodle, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat. END
BEGIN NOW That's what that is. All right. END
BEGIN NOW But the ground sausage really is the foundation of it. END
BEGIN NOW I could eat it all day long. END
BEGIN NOW Good deal. END
BEGIN NOW All day long. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding. Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Your two lasagnas are up, kiddo. END
BEGIN NOW The pasta's very fresh. It has a perfect texture. END
BEGIN NOW It's not tough. It's not chewy. END
BEGIN NOW My grandfather used to make Italian sausage, and it tastes very much like his. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I definitely get cravings for this. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, this is funky. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW You are right in the middle of a market. END
BEGIN NOW It's a little like stepping back into like Little Italy or something like that. END
BEGIN NOW And part of that old-school feeling is the deli load of sandwiches they're making up fresh, including an Italian take on a monster New Orleans classic. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, we got the muffaletta ready. END
BEGIN NOW It's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW It has layers of different types of Italian cheeses. END
BEGIN NOW The bread is sweet. END
BEGIN NOW It contrasts with the spiciness of the meats on there. END
BEGIN NOW I have to have that at least ask when I can. END
BEGIN NOW What are making? The muffaletta. END
BEGIN NOW Tapenade time. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Got black olives. END
BEGIN NOW The green olives. END
BEGIN NOW Roasted red peppers, Kalamata. END

BEGIN NOW Now we put the muffaletta together. You betcha. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, we got our homemade focaccia bread. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Now we get the oil. END
BEGIN NOW First I'm gonna start with the mozzarella. END
BEGIN NOW Now a layer of Genoa salami. END
BEGIN NOW Next we'll go to the provolone. END
BEGIN NOW You ever think about putting some cheese on this? END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Little bit of capocollo on top. END
BEGIN NOW Holy moly! END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] And now for the tapenade. END
BEGIN NOW On goes the top. END
BEGIN NOW This is our homemade dipping sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Got vinegars and pepper juice, and that makes it. END
BEGIN NOW If you love Italian cold cuts, if you love brininess and salty, this is your sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW The richness and all these different components. END
BEGIN NOW And the dipping sauce is righteous, man. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, that's good stuff. END
BEGIN NOW This is how you make it. This is the Gannucci way. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Here's your muffaletta. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW The olives on the muffaletta sandwich are great. END
BEGIN NOW The more olives, the better. END
BEGIN NOW It's a big portion. It is a big portion, but the best part is you can take some home. END
BEGIN NOW I love walking into this place. END
BEGIN NOW It's just kind of feel like home when I come here. END
BEGIN NOW And here's the deal In a mom-and-pop joint, it's all that energy and all that love and family participation that really makes it so great. END
BEGIN NOW I believe it. Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW Great job, man. Great job. END
BEGIN NOW Up next, a unique stop in Eugene, Oregon END
BEGIN NOW So, Triple D has been on the air for over 7 1/2 years, END
BEGIN NOW over 21 seasons, and we have visited over 800 locations. END
BEGIN NOW We've had a lot of firsts first burger joint, barbecue joint, taco joint, you name it. END
BEGIN NOW The list goes on and on. END

BEGIN NOW We're here in Eugene, Oregon, to check out an all-vegan restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW This is Cornbread Cafe. END
BEGIN NOW Fish and chips, table 2. END
BEGIN NOW It's wonderful, Southern-style comfort food. END
BEGIN NOW Barbecue plate, table 3. END
BEGIN NOW Everything is really yummy. END
BEGIN NOW If you weren't a vegan and you came in here, I think you'd eat a lot of the similar items that you see at most comfort-food diners. END
BEGIN NOW Which is no accident. END
BEGIN NOW What I like to do is veganize traditional recipes. END
BEGIN NOW Since 2011, owner Sher Walters has been serving up those favorites in a funky '50s building. END
BEGIN NOW Was it an old diner? It was a drive-in. END
BEGIN NOW So, you wanted a diner feeling. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW but you wanted to make it vegan. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a meat-eater, and this is a place that I've never noticed that I am not eating meat. END
BEGIN NOW sandwich up, table 1. END
BEGIN NOW The Eugenewich is their signature sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW It's a big slab of fried, flavorful tofu with haystack onions. END
BEGIN NOW It's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make Southern-fried tofu for our Eugenewich. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, let's get into this. END
BEGIN NOW How many pounds of tofu do you guys think you go through in a week Give or take, 350 pounds. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of tofu. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna line it on the sheet tray END
BEGIN NOW bake it for about 14 minutes in a 350-degree oven. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we've got our tofu that is cooled down. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And we're ready to start making the dredge. END
BEGIN NOW Unsweetened soy milk. END
BEGIN NOW Apple cider vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW Little hot sauce. And the hot sauce. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is making our buttermilk. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW All right, we're gonna season the flour. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. Baking powder. Great. Salt. END
BEGIN NOW And sea salt and poultry seasoning, black pepper, and celery seed. END
BEGIN NOW And then I just get my hands in the and mix it up. END
BEGIN NOW Let me see the magic. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] So, it goes into the buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Dredge them through. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Back into the buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW And a dredge. You get a nice coating on this. END
BEGIN NOW And that goes in the fryer for about two minutes. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna fry all this and build a sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Then I put on the Daiya tapioca cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Take a grilled bun. END
BEGIN NOW This is our Eugenewich sauce that we made with our house-made barbecue sauce and vegan mayo. END
BEGIN NOW And lettuce and tomato, our Southern-fried tofu patty and this is our carrot bacon. Interesting. END
BEGIN NOW Our haystack onions, then we're gonna pair that with our home fries. END
BEGIN NOW Here you go, Triple D vegan. END
BEGIN NOW That's great. END
BEGIN NOW It's got texture. It's got chew. END
BEGIN NOW The barbecue sauce is out of bounds. END
BEGIN NOW The haystack fries that makes it fly. END
BEGIN NOW I don't get anything like, Ohh, that's tofu. [laughs] I mean, I would challenge anybody that says they don't like vegan food to try that and tell me that they don't dig it. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW You got the crispiness of the tofu. END
BEGIN NOW It has a sweetness to it. It has a smokiness. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is Chef Preston, owns one of the best sushi restaurants that you'll find here in the Eugene area. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what you think Chef. END
BEGIN NOW Texture is just crispy and perfect. END
BEGIN NOW I can feel the owner's passion in the food. END
BEGIN NOW Hot Thing, no veggies, and a Reuben, table 5. END
BEGIN NOW Where did you learn to cook? END
BEGIN NOW I learned to cook from my grandma. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice. Grandma was vegan? END
BEGIN NOW A vegetarian for 60-plus years. END
BEGIN NOW No! Really? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW That's awesome. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW I got the frozen peanut butter pie. Oh, boy! END
BEGIN NOW And it looks like dessert's also been handed down. END
BEGIN NOW The frozen peanut butter pie is just awesome. END
BEGIN NOW It's almost like a frozen peanut butter cup. END
BEGIN NOW We're going to make our frozen peanut butter pie. END
BEGIN NOW Got vegan cream cheese. END
BEGIN NOW We'll beat that. END
BEGIN NOW Creamy peanut butter here. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna alternate a few times between the soy milk and powdered sugar. END
BEGIN NOW You want me to sprinkle? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW All right, here's our vegan whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW Into the spring form pan. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna drizzle chocolate sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Do a little swirly Very cool. END
BEGIN NOW Goes into the freezer for two hours. END
BEGIN NOW Peanut butter pie, Guy. END
BEGIN NOW It's just a really excellent balance of flavor and texture, kind of a cross between a cheesecake and an ice cream pie. END
BEGIN NOW That right there has a savory component to it, like with the peanuts. END
BEGIN NOW Not overly sweet by any means. END
BEGIN NOW It's awesome. It really is. END
BEGIN NOW It's thick. It's rich. END
BEGIN NOW It's a perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate. END
BEGIN NOW 00 In fact, I would work here for free just to learn how to do what they do. END
BEGIN NOW You could have named it Funkalicious. I'm very impressed. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome job. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Very proud of you. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's it for this edition of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be looking for you next time on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. That's good. END
BEGIN NOW Whistling Uh, hey, Johnny? END
BEGIN NOW I need the metal container with the flour in it for the table. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] JAMIE: I'm Jamie. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm Bobby. END
BEGIN NOW And we're on a road trip to find the best food the South has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW Good cheers, brother. END
BEGIN NOW In West Virginia, we find a barbecue joint that'll make you want to slap your mama. END
BEGIN NOW Call my wife and tell her I ain't coming home. END
BEGIN NOW A fried fish sandwich and a delicious strawberry pie with whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW Great day in the morning! END
BEGIN NOW And it's not the South without chili dogs, y'all, fried green tomatoes, and creamy custard shakes. END
BEGIN NOW And we can't leave West Virginia without hitting their world-famous white-water rapids. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW So y'all hop in for a ride on our Southern Fried Road Trip. END
BEGIN NOW 375, about 7 to 8 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa, hot and fast. You know. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, chicken's out. END

BEGIN NOW Red beans and rice are finished. END
BEGIN NOW Put it together, 'cause I'm gonna drown in my own saliva. END
BEGIN NOW All right, we ready to go? END
BEGIN NOW Look at that, though. END
BEGIN NOW [laughing] Yes! END
BEGIN NOW That was okay. Oh. END
BEGIN NOW That's outrageous level of red beans and rice. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, good. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW The smoked turkey leg is really the key factor. END
BEGIN NOW I get smoky, I get meaty, I get super-tender beans. END
BEGIN NOW I get it all together, and with the fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW  END
BEGIN NOW The chicken is very simple. END
BEGIN NOW Nice breading. Not greasy. END
BEGIN NOW Old school. Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. You rocked the house. END
BEGIN NOW Fried chicken, red beans and rice. END
BEGIN NOW Enjoy. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW The chicken is crispy on the outside, And it just kind of melts in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Smoked turkey is not something that overpowers the beans or the andouille sausage, but is a nice complement. END
BEGIN NOW It's just cooked to perfection, like everything that Pam does. END
BEGIN NOW I have a gumbo coming up. Now, where did you learn to cook? END
BEGIN NOW I had a great grandmother, Gussie Hayes, who Time out. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Gussie Hayes. END
BEGIN NOW That's a name! END
BEGIN NOW She taught me how to cook when I was about 9 years old. END
BEGIN NOW I just fell love with it. END
BEGIN NOW And these days, she still loves cooking up both the savory and sweet side of Southern. END
BEGIN NOW Red-velvet waffle, cream-cheese topping. END
BEGIN NOW The red-velvet waffles are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW They melt in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how else to them. END
BEGIN NOW I think I called them heavenly. END

BEGIN NOW Okay. We've got me cake flour here. END
BEGIN NOW Cake flour? That's right. END
BEGIN NOW All right. Let it go. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, now the dry ingredients are together. END
BEGIN NOW And we're going to pour our wet ingredient in and mix that up. END
BEGIN NOW The batter is Now END
BEGIN NOW the butter on, and the cream-cheese topping goes right on top. END
BEGIN NOW That over a hot waffle END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna scrape me off the ceiling with a spatula. END
BEGIN NOW Pecans on top. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Here we go. END
BEGIN NOW That's a waffle-lover's waffle. END
BEGIN NOW It's got a little bit of crunch to the outside. END
BEGIN NOW Very soft. Not overly sweet. END
BEGIN NOW The cream-cheese frosting/syrup filling/nougat END
BEGIN NOW is great. END
BEGIN NOW There is one person would walk over hot coals for that my son Ryder. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you so much. Nice job. END
BEGIN NOW Red-velvet waffles. END
BEGIN NOW These are so delicious that you can have them for breakfast, for dinner, for anything. The cream-cheese syrup on top does just the right amount of sweet. Cream-cheese syrup. That's the best way to put it. END
BEGIN NOW That says gym membership to me. END
BEGIN NOW Southern-fried chicken piccata. END
BEGIN NOW Here's what I love about what you do Everything is tied to you, everything is tied to family, and it feels like you're at some family's home. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, Guy. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome job. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Gussie Hayes. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here in north Baltimore, Maryland, in an area known as Govans, about two miles away from Loyola University. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here to check out a joint that's got a lot of theories on how they got their name. END
BEGIN NOW Some folks say, well, it was a swimming hole. END
BEGIN NOW Others say it was a spring that dried up. END
BEGIN NOW Regardless of how they got their name, it's a name you'll never forget on Triple This is Swallow at the Hollow. END
BEGIN NOW Sliders up. END
BEGIN NOW Swallow at the Hollow is more than just a burger place. END
BEGIN NOW T minutes on those wings. END
BEGIN NOW There's always something different. END
BEGIN NOW Blackened-tuna pita. END
BEGIN NOW I've been coming to the Swallow since college. END
BEGIN NOW I can remember when they had greasy, grimy floors, before it was purchased by Aaron. END
BEGIN NOW That'd be chef and owner Aaron Reinhart, who's been serving up scratch-made pub grub since he took over in 2011. END
BEGIN NOW You buy it, and you re-invigorate the menu. END
BEGIN NOW When I got here, it was all frozen food. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. It's just a notch above anything you're gonna find at another dive bar. END
BEGIN NOW Honey-ghost wings up. END
BEGIN NOW MAN #3: I've probably had the honey-ghost wings 50, 60 times easily. END
BEGIN NOW I don't even order wings anywhere else. Just here. END
BEGIN NOW Now comes something that I'm very fearful of. END
BEGIN NOW Ghost pepper-honey wings? Honey-ghost. END
BEGIN NOW Those right there rather hot. END
BEGIN NOW You're a scary man. All right, first up? END
BEGIN NOW Honey-ghost pepper wing sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Hit it, man. END
BEGIN NOW Olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW Onions in. END
BEGIN NOW Diced serrano peppers. END

BEGIN NOW First step? Start with the honey, honey. END
BEGIN NOW Ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW Worcestershire sauce. END

BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna hit the super slurry? END
BEGIN NOW Ohh. END
BEGIN NOW This is funky town. END

BEGIN NOW The wings are cooked perfectly. They're very juicy There's the right amount of heat just a little burn. END
BEGIN NOW Now, don't get scared by the ghost pepper. END
BEGIN NOW It lets you know it's there, kind of like a ghost. END
BEGIN NOW and the sauce is incredibly flavorful the Worcestershire and the molasses. END
BEGIN NOW The coffee, really, I think, is probably the big kicker. END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous. You could be known for the wing alone just on this It's that good. Cool. That's what we're looking for. END
BEGIN NOW I love the honey-ghost wings. END
BEGIN NOW They're very nice and crispy on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW They're juicy on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW And the end, it just has the best kick to it. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of the ghost heat. Ghost heat. END
BEGIN NOW The Swallow at the Hollow's been iconic here in the North Baltimore neighborhood for years and years. How old is this joint? END
BEGIN NOW This was here in the '40s. END
BEGIN NOW My grandmother used to come here on her lunch hour. END
BEGIN NOW It was a dive, dive bar. END

BEGIN NOW Lettuce just enough for a little bit of crunch. END
BEGIN NOW Pico. END
BEGIN NOW Now goes your steak. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Back on the grill to seal. END
BEGIN NOW Once it's sealed, it's ready to be cut and plated. END
BEGIN NOW Wow, look at you, plating genius. END
BEGIN NOW Height, baby. Height. END
BEGIN NOW This is what we call, in the rest of the country, a burrito. END

BEGIN NOW Mix her up. Get the whisk to it. END
BEGIN NOW Turns to a nice slurry. END

BEGIN NOW [whistles] So, now this is just gonna thicken up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW This is one of the funkiest red-eye gravies we have ever seen in the history of Triple Here's our biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW I think to do this the right way, I'm gonna try to load it up with all of the bacon, the sausage, and the prime rib. END
BEGIN NOW Juicy meat, great texture, little bit of salt, little bit of sweetness, really nice biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW Super coffee flavor. Coffee leads here. END
BEGIN NOW This is Crazytown next to Flavortown. END

BEGIN NOW Aa The beef in it is just to die for. END
BEGIN NOW I don't even like coffee, but I really love the espresso in it. END
BEGIN NOW And the biscuits are light and fluffy and fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW This is the kind of place that you root for. END
BEGIN NOW This is the experience you have to have. END
BEGIN NOW If you think this is unique and interesting and adventurous, wait till you try the END
BEGIN NOW Jalapeño hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna love them. END
BEGIN NOW That's when we come back. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome back, Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives in Delta, Wisconsin, and let me introduce you to the wild, wild west family of the Liautauds. END
BEGIN NOW That would be my buddy, Jimmy John Liautaud. END
BEGIN NOW That's right the dude from Jimmy John's Sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're hanging out here at the Delta Diner, a place that I discovered with this crazy family a year ago, and now Triple D is finally here. END
BEGIN NOW This is Big Jim. END
BEGIN NOW did you find it, or did Jimmy find it? END
BEGIN NOW I think I found it. You think you found it? END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We had some fantastic red-eye gravy made with more coffee grounds than should ever be put into any dish. END
BEGIN NOW It was outstanding, and it just gets crazy from here. END
BEGIN NOW Pancakes with jalapeños. END
BEGIN NOW It sounds crazy, but they're awesome. END
BEGIN NOW Yep, you heard it right jalapeño hot cakes. END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous. So let's get it going. END
BEGIN NOW We'll start out with the gravy. END
BEGIN NOW All-purpose flour. END
BEGIN NOW Sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Baking powder. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of cinnamon and salt All right, just mix this together. END
BEGIN NOW Set it aside. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW That's a lot of egg, baby. END
BEGIN NOW Mix those up. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy, can you pour the vanilla? END
BEGIN NOW Are you helping now? END
BEGIN NOW I'm helping. All right! END
BEGIN NOW This is really nice. END
BEGIN NOW Milk. END
BEGIN NOW Want me to stir this for you? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Jimmy. You know how to cook. END
BEGIN NOW All right. There we go. END
BEGIN NOW Just keep her going. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy and his family have this great little cabin that we goo ever year. END
BEGIN NOW And we were hanging out one day, and Jimmy says, I'm gonna take you to this great diner. Then I have this Norwegian pancake, so I knew that we would be coming back here. END
BEGIN NOW Melted butter. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of butter, and this makes what I would call a not very thick batter. END
BEGIN NOW No. It's gonna be thin. END
BEGIN NOW It goes in a container, goes in the fridge. END
BEGIN NOW We've had a chance for the pancake batter to rest. END
BEGIN NOW Onto the griddle? This is it. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see it. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Now you're gonna throw on chopped pickled jalapeño. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. END
BEGIN NOW This does not look like it should work at all. END
BEGIN NOW Now you smell the jalapeños starting to caramelize a little bit on the grill. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna sprinkle the powdered sugar on it All right, so, everybody, here's what you do. END
BEGIN NOW Grab that lemon. END
BEGIN NOW Squeeze it around on top of that. END
BEGIN NOW Why this works, I do not know. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] I don't say it very often, but this is probably in the top three best pancakes I've ever had on Triple D, if not the best. END
BEGIN NOW It's tender. It's light. It's thin. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of think about it like a crepe gone wild. END
BEGIN NOW And it is sweet. That's a sweet batter. END
BEGIN NOW It's nice and eggy. END
BEGIN NOW And the lemon and the sugar just cut the hot perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW It's an amazing combination. END
BEGIN NOW Leslie Liautaud, what do you think? END
BEGIN NOW The jalapeño is not hot. It's savory. END
BEGIN NOW so you get a perfect savory and sweet mixture. END
BEGIN NOW I get caught between texture and flavor. END
BEGIN NOW They're both vying for all your attention. END
BEGIN NOW It's really just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't expect it to be this great. END
BEGIN NOW It's worth a special journey to get here. END
BEGIN NOW So, there you are, in the real-deal diner in the middle of nowhere. END
BEGIN NOW Adios! END
BEGIN NOW Coming up, in Duluth, Minnesota END
BEGIN NOW That is thick and dense. END
BEGIN NOW a doing-it-all Italian spot END
BEGIN NOW All day long. END
BEGIN NOW serving it up family-style. END
BEGIN NOW If you've been watching Triple D for a while, you know I'm a huge fan of Italian markets. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I don't know what it is. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it's my heritage. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it's the fact that you can go in, it's part grocery store and part deli and you can get a little snack or a little Italian specialty. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, the list goes on and on. END
BEGIN NOW So, I'm here in the Spirit Valley neighborhood right outside of Duluth, Minnesota, to check out a joint where a family is doing that and more. END
BEGIN NOW This is Gannucci's Italian Market. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken Parm and a porchetta, table 6. END
BEGIN NOW Everything is homemade here. END
BEGIN NOW Meatball sub and muffaletta. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW It's family-owned. END
BEGIN NOW It's been in the family for a while. END
BEGIN NOW  That would be since 1978, and the running the ship since 2011 is owner and chef Billy Kalligher. END
BEGIN NOW So, now, your family works here? Your kids work here, as well? END
BEGIN NOW Yep, my wife, my son, my daughters, yep. END
BEGIN NOW How many daughters do you have? END
BEGIN NOW Six. What? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW And a son? Three. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. END
BEGIN NOW just makes you feel like you're at home. END
BEGIN NOW Got a lasagna for table 4. END
BEGIN NOW This lasagna ranks as one of the best that I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of good layer good cheese. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, what are we gonna make first? END
BEGIN NOW Make Italian sausage for lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get after it, then. All right. END
BEGIN NOW I have a pork butt. Cut up in pieces. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm gonna feed it through the grinder, grind away. END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm ready to season it up. END
BEGIN NOW In goes the ground pork. END
BEGIN NOW I add water, salt, granulated garlic, fennel seed. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW And some ground anise seed. END
BEGIN NOW How long will you cook this down? Just until it's brown. END
BEGIN NOW Smells awesome. END
BEGIN NOW What are we up to now? END
BEGIN NOW Pasta. Beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW The dough's ready to be rolled out. Here we go. END
BEGIN NOW A little flour down. END
BEGIN NOW Roll it out. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, you can work some dough. END
BEGIN NOW Cut it up. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna boil these for about 30 seconds. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, once they're done, in some cold water. END
BEGIN NOW Not completely cooked, though. END
BEGIN NOW Nope. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, now I'm going to assemble my lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW First our homemade marinara. END
BEGIN NOW Noodles in. END
BEGIN NOW More marinara on top of that. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'm going to put my Italian sausage down. END
BEGIN NOW That is great Italian sausage. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Top it with some cheese and then build another layer. END
BEGIN NOW More sauce. More sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Some good Romano on it, more sausage, and this will be the last layer. END
BEGIN NOW Three layers? Three layers. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna cook this off in the oven. END
BEGIN NOW What temp? END
BEGIN NOW About 275, 300, just to bring it up the temp and melt the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna be out in 45 minutes? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW That is thick and dense. END
BEGIN NOW Low-cal. END
BEGIN NOW Low-cal 'sagna. END
BEGIN NOW What I like is, it's simple, it's completely balanced, little saltiness from that Romano cheese. END
BEGIN NOW The kind of lasagna I wanted as a kid was noodle, noodle, noodle, noodle, noodle, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat. END
BEGIN NOW That's what that is. All right. END
BEGIN NOW But the ground sausage really is the foundation of it. END
BEGIN NOW I could eat it all day long. END
BEGIN NOW Good deal. END
BEGIN NOW All day long. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding. Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Your two lasagnas are up, kiddo. END
BEGIN NOW The pasta's very fresh. It has a perfect texture. END
BEGIN NOW It's not tough. It's not chewy. END
BEGIN NOW My grandfather used to make Italian sausage, and it tastes very much like his. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I definitely get cravings for this. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, this is funky. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW You are right in the middle of a market. END
BEGIN NOW It's a little like stepping back into like Little Italy or something like that. END
BEGIN NOW And part of that old-school feeling is the deli load of sandwiches they're making up fresh, including an Italian take on a monster New Orleans classic. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, we got the muffaletta ready. END
BEGIN NOW It's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW It has layers of different types of Italian cheeses. END
BEGIN NOW The bread is sweet. END
BEGIN NOW It contrasts with the spiciness of the meats on there. END
BEGIN NOW I have to have that at least know when I can. END
BEGIN NOW What are making? The muffaletta. END
BEGIN NOW Tapenade time. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Got black olives. END
BEGIN NOW The green olives. END
BEGIN NOW Roasted red peppers, Kalamata. END
BEGIN NOW Capers. Capers, baby. END
BEGIN NOW And then some olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Oregano. END
BEGIN NOW And the best garlic Mix this up, let it kind of marry together. END
BEGIN NOW You bet. END
BEGIN NOW Now we put the muffaletta together. You betcha. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, we got our homemade focaccia bread. END
BEGIN NOW Cut. END
BEGIN NOW Now we get the oil. END
BEGIN NOW First I'm gonna start with the mozzarella. END
BEGIN NOW Now a layer of Genoa salami. END
BEGIN NOW Next we'll go to the provolone. END
BEGIN NOW You ever think about putting some cheese on this? END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Little bit of capocollo on top. END
BEGIN NOW Holy moly! END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] And now for the tapenade. END
BEGIN NOW On goes the top. END
BEGIN NOW This is our homemade dipping sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Got vinegars and pepper juice, and that makes it. END
BEGIN NOW If you love Italian cold cuts, if you love brininess and salty, this is your sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW The richness and all these different components. END
BEGIN NOW And the dipping sauce is righteous, man. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, that's good stuff. END
BEGIN NOW This is how you make it. This is the Gannucci way. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Here's your muffaletta. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW The olives on the muffaletta sandwich are great. END
BEGIN NOW The more olives, the better. END
BEGIN NOW It's a big portion. It is a big portion, but the best part is you can take some home. END
BEGIN NOW I love walking into this place. END
BEGIN NOW It's just kind of feel like home when I come here. END
BEGIN NOW And here's the deal In a mom-and-pop joint, it's all that energy and all that love and family participation that really makes it so great. END
BEGIN NOW I believe it. Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW Great job, man. Great job. END
BEGIN NOW Up next, a unique stop in Eugene, Oregon END
BEGIN NOW So, Triple D has been on the air for over 7 1/2 years, END
BEGIN NOW over 21 seasons, and we have visited over 800 locations. END
BEGIN NOW We've had a lot of firsts first burger joint, barbecue joint, taco joint, you name it. END

BEGIN NOW It's wonderful, Southern-style comfort food. END
BEGIN NOW Barbecue plate, table 3. END
BEGIN NOW Everything is really yummy. END
BEGIN NOW If you weren't a vegan and you came in here, I think you'd eat a lot of the similar items that you see at most comfort-food diners. END
BEGIN NOW Which is no accident. END
BEGIN NOW What I like to do is veganize traditional recipes. END
BEGIN NOW Since 2011, owner Sher Walters has been serving up those favorites in a funky '50s building. END
BEGIN NOW Was it an old diner? It was a drive-in. END
BEGIN NOW So, you wanted a diner feeling. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW DD but you wanted to make it vegan. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a meat-eater, and this is a place that I've never noticed that I am not eating meat. END
BEGIN NOW Eugenewich up, table 1. END
BEGIN NOW The Eugenewich is their signature sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW It's a big slab of fried, flavorful tofu with haystack onions. END
BEGIN NOW It's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make Southern-fried tofu for our Eugenewich. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, let's get into this. END
BEGIN NOW How many pounds of tofu do you guys think you go through in a week Give or take, 350 pounds. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of tofu. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna line it on the sheet tray END
BEGIN NOW bake it for about 14 minutes in a 350-degree oven. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we've got our tofu that is cooled down. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And we're ready to start making the dredge. END
BEGIN NOW Unsweetened soy milk. END
BEGIN NOW Apple cider vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW Little hot sauce. And the hot sauce. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is making our buttermilk. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW All right, we're gonna season the flour. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. Baking powder. Great. Salt. END
BEGIN NOW And sea salt and poultry seasoning, black pepper, and celery seed. END
BEGIN NOW And then I just get my hands in the and mix it up. END
BEGIN NOW Let me see the magic. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] So, it goes into the buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Dredge them through. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Back into the buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW And a dredge. You get a nice coating on this. END
BEGIN NOW And that goes in the fryer for about two minutes. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna fry all this and build a sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Then I put on the Daiya tapioca cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Take a grilled bun. END
BEGIN NOW This is our Eugenewich sauce that we made with our house-made barbecue sauce and vegan mayo. END
BEGIN NOW And lettuce and tomato, our Southern-fried tofu patty and this is our carrot bacon. Interesting. END
BEGIN NOW Our haystack onions, then we're gonna pair that with our home fries. END
BEGIN NOW Here you go, Triple D vegan. END
BEGIN NOW That's great. END
BEGIN NOW It's got texture. It's got chew. END
BEGIN NOW The barbecue sauce is out of bounds. END
BEGIN NOW The haystack fries that makes it fly. END
BEGIN NOW I don't get anything like, Ohh, that's tofu. [laughs] I mean, I would challenge anybody that says they don't like vegan food to try that and tell me that they don't dig it. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW You got the crispiness of the tofu. END
BEGIN NOW It has a sweetness to it. It has a smokiness. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is Chef Preston, owns one of the best sushi restaurants that you'll find here in the Eugene area. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what you think Chef. END
BEGIN NOW Texture is just crispy and perfect. END
BEGIN NOW I can feel the owner's passion in the food. END
BEGIN NOW Hot Thing, no veggies, and a Reuben, table 5. END
BEGIN NOW Where did you learn to cook? END
BEGIN NOW I learned to cook from my grandma. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice. Grandma was vegan? END
BEGIN NOW A vegetarian for 60-plus years. END
BEGIN NOW No! Really? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW That's awesome. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW I got the frozen peanut butter pie. Oh, boy! END
BEGIN NOW And it looks like dessert's also been handed down. END
BEGIN NOW The frozen peanut butter pie is just awesome. END
BEGIN NOW It's almost like a frozen peanut butter cup. END
BEGIN NOW We're going to make our frozen peanut butter pie. END
BEGIN NOW Got vegan cream cheese. END
BEGIN NOW We'll beat that. END
BEGIN NOW Creamy peanut butter here. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna alternate a few times between the soy milk and powdered sugar. END
BEGIN NOW You want me to sprinkle? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW All right, here's our vegan whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW Into the spring form pan. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna drizzle chocolate sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Do a little swirly Very cool. END
BEGIN NOW Goes into the freezer for two hours. END
BEGIN NOW Peanut butter pie, Guy. END
BEGIN NOW It's just a really excellent balance of flavor and texture, kind of a cross between a cheesecake and an ice cream pie. END
BEGIN NOW That right there has a savory component to it, like with the peanuts. END
BEGIN NOW Not overly sweet by any means. END
BEGIN NOW It's awesome. It really is. END
BEGIN NOW It's thick. It's rich. END
BEGIN NOW It's a perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, I would work here for free just to learn how to do what they do. END
BEGIN NOW You could have named it Funkalicious. I'm very impressed. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome job. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Very proud of you. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's it for this edition of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. If you want to check out some of the recipes for the joints we visit END
BEGIN NOW I'll be looking for you next time on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. That's good. END
BEGIN NOW Whistling Uh, hey, Johnny? END
BEGIN NOW I need the metal container with the flour in it for the table. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] JAMIE: I'm Jamie. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm Bobby. END
BEGIN NOW And we're on a road trip to find the best food the South has to offer. END
BEGIN NOW Good cheers, brother. END
BEGIN NOW In West Virginia, we find a barbecue joint that'll make you want to slap your mama. END
BEGIN NOW Call my wife and tell her I ain't coming home. END
BEGIN NOW A fried fish sandwich and a delicious strawberry pie with whipped cream. END
BEGIN NOW Great day in the morning! END
BEGIN NOW And it's not the South without chili dogs, y'all, fried green tomatoes, and creamy custard shakes. END
BEGIN NOW And we can't leave West Virginia without hitting their world-famous white-water rapids. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW So y'all hop in for a ride on our Southern Fried Road Trip. END
BEGIN NOW This is our master fat bacon fat and pickled pastrami fat. END
BEGIN NOW get any more ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW Just baste it with fat. END
BEGIN NOW Spread your glaze a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Baste a little bit more. END
BEGIN NOW Dried sour cherries. END
BEGIN NOW Nice call. END
BEGIN NOW It's got to reduce all the way with some of our au jus. END
BEGIN NOW It just reduced, so it's just gelatinized. END
BEGIN NOW All right, cool. Are we ready to plate this thing? Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW Rice. END
BEGIN NOW The most careful part. END
BEGIN NOW That's ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW Look at this, dude. END
BEGIN NOW What a dish. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, give that a try. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna finish this with a little bit of cilantro on top, too. END
BEGIN NOW Ohh, it's ridiculously good. END
BEGIN NOW Tender, juicy meat. END
BEGIN NOW Rich, well-rounded. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and when you get one of those cherries END
BEGIN NOW That's got to be in the top three best goat dishes I've ever had. Amazing. END
BEGIN NOW This guy's out-of-bounds! END
BEGIN NOW The meat is literally melting off of the bone. END
BEGIN NOW It's incredibly flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my gosh. It's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Intense but subtle. I could stick my head in it. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] This is the famous Nicky Sitnycky from John's on 12th. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunately, we lost your partner. END
BEGIN NOW Mikey 2 Names. Yeah, Mikey 2 Names. END
BEGIN NOW You guys were business partners for how many years? END
BEGIN NOW Almost 41 years. END
BEGIN NOW Great and very missed. END
BEGIN NOW I had a blast making meatballs with him, cooking with him in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW These meatballs are giving me trouble. END
BEGIN NOW What's the story, Guy? END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW He's talking to the meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think of this place? END
BEGIN NOW Luscious, scrumptious. END
BEGIN NOW This is all family here, just like John's. END
BEGIN NOW Which means we're gonna stay a while. END
BEGIN NOW When we come back END
BEGIN NOW Julie, wings. Table 2. END
BEGIN NOW we're tucking in to the Ducks' take on wings. END
BEGIN NOW What you come up with is big, flavorful, unique styles. END
BEGIN NOW Triple D is parked at Ducks Eatery on one of NYC's best streets for eats East 12th. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Will Horowitz and his sister, Julie, are putting deep, worldly flavors into a backpacker's dream menu. END
BEGIN NOW Even the chicken wing is definitely a thing. END
BEGIN NOW Julie, wings. Table 2. END
BEGIN NOW Had some jumbo chicken wings END
BEGIN NOW Which were insane. END
BEGIN NOW I've made a complete mess of myself just shoveling wings in my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna do some whole, smoked chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW Start off by just making our marinade. END
BEGIN NOW We have some palm sugar, brown sugar, a little bit of white, northern Indian yellow curry, black pepper, a little bit more of that green cardamom, some fresh garlic, chopped shallots, lemongrass, Kaffir lime leaves, a whole load of cilantro stems. END
BEGIN NOW I lost count at 40. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] dark soy sauce, apple-cider vinegar, fish sauce from Vietnam, a whole bunch of limes. END
BEGIN NOW This has a real strong lime sort of flavor to the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna get in there, try and mix it all around, let those flavors marry a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Whole chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna dump it right over here. END
BEGIN NOW Just gonna pour on some water. END
BEGIN NOW Let that sit and brine overnight. END
BEGIN NOW We'll air-dry them a little bit, then we're gonna smoke them. END
BEGIN NOW About 210, 225. END
BEGIN NOW These guys have been in here for about four hours now. END
BEGIN NOW Let them cool down, dry a little bit, then we'll hit them to the fryer. END
BEGIN NOW Chill out for a bit. END
BEGIN NOW This is our jerk sauce. Let it marry a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Crazy. END
BEGIN NOW That's it. Simple. END
BEGIN NOW I like when it's a big wing, 'cause you get the opportunity to leave all the juices inside. END
BEGIN NOW So you get all that flavor left in there. END
BEGIN NOW The way you guys say this smoker is complementing the brine and the sauce so well. END
BEGIN NOW What you come up with is just really flavorful, big, unique style. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome job, brother. Really. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think of these wings? END
BEGIN NOW There’s fruitiness, there's sweetness, there's peppery. END
BEGIN NOW I love it. END
BEGIN NOW The that shot my promo package when I got on The Next Food Network Star and helped start me and my whole career Neil Regan. END
BEGIN NOW Huge mistake. END
BEGIN NOW Both laugh It's just something that you really can't find anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome place, man. Great creativity, using old-school fundamentals, techniques, and methods. END
BEGIN NOW Bringing out big flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Killer. Thanks, brother. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome job. END
BEGIN NOW Coming up. You did what? we're headed to Miami, Florida END
BEGIN NOW That is tender, porky, fall-apart-y. END
BEGIN NOW for some authentic southern surf and turf. END
BEGIN NOW This is the best of both worlds. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome homes, really cool shops, and killer restaurants, like this joint Whisk. END
BEGIN NOW Everything in here is just so fresh and so delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Cornmeal-fried okra. END
BEGIN NOW It's the southern, gourmet, low-country restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW Shrimp and grits for you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW And there's nothing like it in Miami. END
BEGIN NOW Fried-green-tomato salad. Right on time. END
BEGIN NOW And the man with the plan is Miami's own Chef Brendan Connor, whose academic pursuits led him to the Carolina low country for reasons other than food. END
BEGIN NOW I heard there was a 7-1 girl-to-ratio at the College of Charleston. END
BEGIN NOW And while he did earn a degree in history, he also got a killer education in some of Charleston's best joints. END
BEGIN NOW And in 2011, he and his sister, Kristin, opened up this spot, serving up the low-country meals they grew up on. END
BEGIN NOW My parents are great cooks, and my grandparents were even better cooks. END
BEGIN NOW And we took a lot of what their basics were and refined them a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW And he's even putting a twist on fresh seafood from the coast END
BEGIN NOW ? -+ kind of dish. END
BEGIN NOW It's quite flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start scoring and preparing this fish here. END
BEGIN NOW We can use yellow tail. We can use red snapper. END
BEGIN NOW Mm Lane snapper's what they had for us today. END
BEGIN NOW First thing we do to prepare it is cut off the fins side and the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW Next we are going to diamond-score so that it makes it easier for you to eat. END
BEGIN NOW It also gets If we're gonna fry this, it's nice to be able to get in there with some of the crunch-a-taciousness. END
BEGIN NOW That's an Uncle Bo right there. END
BEGIN NOW Crunch-a-taciousness, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We want to make sure it can talk to you when it goes out onto the plate. END
BEGIN NOW Naturally, a little bit of salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Dredge it lightly in corn starch. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, nice and crunchy. END
BEGIN NOW That's right. END
BEGIN NOW Now we'll go to the fryer? END
BEGIN NOW To the fryer we go. END
BEGIN NOW Are we frying in anything special? END
BEGIN NOW Peanut oil? 10-40? peanut oil. END
BEGIN NOW Of course you do. You're a low-country kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW You got to be running peanut oil. Always peanut oil. END
BEGIN NOW So we've got our whole-fried fish ready to go, ready to hit the plate. END
BEGIN NOW Got to take the skewer out of the mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Epic. END
BEGIN NOW And ready for a little bit of that low-country peanut sauce. END
BEGIN NOW look at that. END
BEGIN NOW I like to finish it off with some fresh cilantro right there in the pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Oh. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW That is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW If you like fried fish but you like real fish flavor, whereas a lot of times, fried fish will kind of get lost using fish that doesn't have a lot of flavor, this is the best of both worlds. END
BEGIN NOW The crunchy texture of the fried fish, all the flavor coming from the bones and the skin, really, it is the best of both worlds. END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous, man. Killer dish. Thank you What's your favorite thing on the menu? END
BEGIN NOW Snapper. END
BEGIN NOW Is it? Hands down? Hands down. END
BEGIN NOW Cooked to perfection. This is our second home. END
BEGIN NOW I feel like I'm family whenever I come in the door. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause comfort food's always been important for the Connor family. END
BEGIN NOW Every time we'd go eat with our grandparent there were biscuits and gravy freshly made every morning, fried chicken that'll knock your socks off. END
BEGIN NOW So he's re-creating that same feeling, even if it means doing things a little different. END
BEGIN NOW We wanted to do ribs here. END
BEGIN NOW We don't have a smoker, so we decided we'd braise them. END
BEGIN NOW So this is what we came up with beer-braised baby-back ribs. END
BEGIN NOW We started with this rub here powdered garlic, onion granulated oregano, chili powder, salt and pepper, and brown sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Being from the south and the low-country cooking, I mean, what does your grandpa say about you not having a smoker for these ribs? END
BEGIN NOW Southern accent You did what? He might be a little disappointed, but I think the final product he'd be all right with. END
BEGIN NOW We get I a nice, meaty rib. END
BEGIN NOW That's a big baby back. That's a big baby-back rib. END
BEGIN NOW Now it's time to rub the ribs. END
BEGIN NOW Make sure to apply this very liberally. END
BEGIN NOW Now you're gonna let them marinate? Overnight. END
BEGIN NOW When they're done marinating, we'll put them on a hot char grill with some salt and pepper to really caramelize the brown sugar on the meat. END
BEGIN NOW Now that we've charred the ribs, we're gonna add some mirepoix to it, our beer, our veg stock END
BEGIN NOW wrap it in plastic, then foil, and then we're ready to go to the oven. END
BEGIN NOW What temp? 300 degrees. END
BEGIN NOW For how long? About two hours. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. Steamy reveal for you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Nice. END
BEGIN NOW That dark beer right on top of that out-of-bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Good. All right, we'll hit the grill. END
BEGIN NOW Take some of our molasses barbecue sauce, flipping it over. END
BEGIN NOW Green onion. Now it's ready. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW That is tender, porky, fall-apart-y. END
BEGIN NOW I got to be honest. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a fan of braised ribs, typically. END
BEGIN NOW This, however, with the dry rub that goes for the 24 hours really penetrating that flavor. END
BEGIN NOW With the mirepoix, that dark beer, and hit with this molasses barbecue sauce END
BEGIN NOW I got be honest, man, you have really done a great job. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Very tender. Falls off the bone. END
BEGIN NOW It has, like, nothing wrong with it. It's just perfect. END
BEGIN NOW He really pays food and makes it very special. END
BEGIN NOW I have never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. END
BEGIN NOW This has the low-country attitude with the sophisticated approach to the presentation. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, man. Congratulations. END
BEGIN NOW So I'm here in Eureka, California. END
BEGIN NOW Now, that's like 20 miles north of my home town of Ferndale. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here to check out a joint where this husband-and-wife team quit their big-shot corporate jobs to get into the restaurant business. END
BEGIN NOW Crazy. END
BEGIN NOW This is Café Nooner. END
BEGIN NOW Pasta plate. END
BEGIN NOW They always have an interesting mix of flavors. END
BEGIN NOW The food is to die for. END
BEGIN NOW Everything I've ever seen off the menu is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW Lamb plate. END
BEGIN NOW Love of food was the one thing Lorrena Filgas and her husband, Joe, did have. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of experience? END
BEGIN NOW Not so much. END
BEGIN NOW So you guys have taken a gigantic leap of faith buying this. END
BEGIN NOW You haven't been in the restaurant business. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Temperature on that is medium, correct? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. All right. END
BEGIN NOW What kind of food do you do here? END
BEGIN NOW We do a Creole-Mediterranean fusion. END
BEGIN NOW Creole-Mediterranean fusion? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Climates are the same in Greece and Louisiana. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yeah, that's how I was looking at it. END
BEGIN NOW What makes their food here so delicious? END
BEGIN NOW do a lot of local ingredients and a lot of organic ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW That's an understatement. END
BEGIN NOW Lorrena keeps it real by supporting over 17 different Humboldt County producers. END
BEGIN NOW Always, year-round, they find a way to have fresh food, and it's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW Pulled pork with apple slaw. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. You're welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Pulled pork, pulled pork END
BEGIN NOW Did you just make a little song about that? END
BEGIN NOW I did. END
BEGIN NOW We are making Creole spice, and we use this to rub our pulled pork. END
BEGIN NOW We use it in a couple of our own recipes. END
BEGIN NOW It's really awesome stuff. Okay, fire it up. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. It gets paprika. END
BEGIN NOW Granulated onion. END
BEGIN NOW Granulated garlic. END
BEGIN NOW You're right on it. Cumin. END
BEGIN NOW Thyme. A little thyme. END
BEGIN NOW A little old bay. END

BEGIN NOW White pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. Black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Sea salt. I see it. END
BEGIN NOW And a little cayenne. END
BEGIN NOW Doctor. Thank you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW So you'll use this interchangeably on a variety of the different proteins you work with. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa! Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Pork butt. END
BEGIN NOW Ii Basically, we're just gonna get this spice mix everywhere we can get it. END
BEGIN NOW Flip it over because this is what's gonna make it taste good. END
BEGIN NOW And then we'll do some Worcestershire. END
BEGIN NOW Worcestershire-shire-shire. END
BEGIN NOW A little liquid smoke. And last, but not least END
BEGIN NOW A little Humboldt hot sauce, and this is a habanero-mango. END
BEGIN NOW Wrap it in foil. What temp are we going at? END
BEGIN NOW 350 for five hours. END
BEGIN NOW For five hours. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW Uh-oh. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Are you there? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, someplace in here. [laughs] Okay, and then we're just gonna pull his the old-fashioned way. END
BEGIN NOW Right in that juice. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna go to the flat top to get a little crust on it. END
BEGIN NOW  END
BEGIN NOW Put a little bit of our barbecue right on that. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna put a little barbecue sauce on this side. END
BEGIN NOW And this has got his brown caramelization on there. END
BEGIN NOW And then we dress it. END
BEGIN NOW Is this really how big this thing is? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Gets a little pickle and a pepper on it. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW That is ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW The liquid smoke, the dry rub, the Worcestershire, the Humboldt habanero hot sauce END
BEGIN NOW all of that together That's some of the best out-of-the-oven pulled pork I've had. END
BEGIN NOW You killed this. Ohh! Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how they make it crispy and tender at the same time. Love it. END
BEGIN NOW The barbecue sauce is I honestly would like to take a bath in it. END

BEGIN NOW This is about as far from a rub as I've ever seen. basically we're Cuban. END
BEGIN NOW You know, we make up our own vocabulary here. END
BEGIN NOW Look how beautiful it is. END

BEGIN NOW And the beans to kind of parlay it all together. END
BEGIN NOW That's when it really starts working. END
BEGIN NOW Well, that's basically the key to Cuban food. END
BEGIN NOW You have to mix everything. END
BEGIN NOW You got to bring it together to fuse all those flavors. END
BEGIN NOW Really nice dish. puerco roast de asado. END
BEGIN NOW it's juicy. I like to eat it with the plantains. END

BEGIN NOW We have the restaurant business in our blood. END
BEGIN NOW In your blood. END
BEGIN NOW man PICK UP, GUYS. MOLE POBLANO CON POLLO. END
BEGIN NOW So, of course, when Luis came to the states in '92, he started cooking right away. END
BEGIN NOW A few years later, he asked his mom Angela to join him in bean town. END
BEGIN NOW She's in the kitchen, mostly in the, you wait, wait wait wait, wait, wait. END
BEGIN NOW You make your mom do the cooking? END
BEGIN NOW My mom's been in the restaurant business for, like, 50 years. END
BEGIN NOW So she's taught Luis to make all of his favorite childhood meals the right way. END
BEGIN NOW My mother doesn't believe in canned stuff. END
BEGIN NOW It has to be from scratch. END
BEGIN NOW Down to the homemade tomatillo sauce on one of my all-time Mexican favorite Luis CHILAQUILES VERDES CON POLLO. END
BEGIN NOW This is just amazing. END
BEGIN NOW Chilaquiles. chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I love it. have you tried them before? END
BEGIN NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? [laughs] This is a body by chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW All right, good, good, good. come on, man. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make? the tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW So the tomatillos usually have a nice paper skin on the outside of 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Some jalapeño. jalapeño. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna boil two jalapeños and the tomatillos? END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. together. END
BEGIN NOW we take the tomatillos and the jalapeños out the hot water. okay. END
BEGIN NOW WOW. THERE YOU GO. END
BEGIN NOW okay. END
BEGIN NOW just between you and me, does your mom know you're using the blender? END
BEGIN NOW She allows me to do that. END
BEGIN NOW Shh. don't drag into this. garlic. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're just ready to blend it. END
BEGIN NOW so now what we're gonna do is obviously cook the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW So we add a little bit of olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW We have to strain the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW And you've got to go like this. oh, oh. END
BEGIN NOW This is part of the show. END
BEGIN NOW I've never seen the Bruce Lee cooking technique. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW We add a little bit of water. okay. END
BEGIN NOW And then we add just a little salt. okay. END
BEGIN NOW We have to add the epazote. I know epazote. END
BEGIN NOW You can't find that very often. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Build the flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Next step? we're gonna fry the tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW and then we just put a little sauce in here, a little bit of chicken stock. okay. END
BEGIN NOW Which you make yourself. of course you do. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. everything is homemade. END
BEGIN NOW otherwise Angela gets upset. END
BEGIN NOW So we just let it sit like that for two minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And then we put the tortilla chips. yep. END
BEGIN NOW They're still gonna have a little bit of crunch to 'em, just a little bit of texture. END
BEGIN NOW Soak up that sauce right now. END
BEGIN NOW So in the meantime, we're gonna start cooking the eggs. oh! END
BEGIN NOW Do you like eggs? how do you want them? END
BEGIN NOW No, but I'll be back. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever you do, do not let them be runny. END
BEGIN NOW All righty. END
BEGIN NOW so over-hard, right? END

BEGIN NOW that you're chila-killing me. END
BEGIN NOW shredded chicken, and some fresh cheese. queso fresco. END
BEGIN NOW Queso fresco. a little onions. END
BEGIN NOW Avocado. refrito. END
BEGIN NOW And the eggs. there you go, on the side. END
BEGIN NOW Good man! END
BEGIN NOW A little parsley. it's ready to serve. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man. that is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW And you get some of that jalapeño bite right off the bat, but then you get this texture. END
BEGIN NOW The tortilla's a little bit soft but still has some crunch. END
BEGIN NOW And then you get a little of the acid from the tomatillo. END
BEGIN NOW A little fresh onion. END
BEGIN NOW The bite, the heat, the crunch, the cream, the chicken, the money. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I'm coming to get this tomorrow. wow. END
BEGIN NOW It's fantastic. the flavors are unbelievable. END

BEGIN NOW Flying pig, one inch punch. END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of nice comfort food. END
BEGIN NOW adobo and a calamansi cooler. END
BEGIN NOW It's very hard to describe, because if you say, Filipino street food, they say, what is I said, you just have to come over to the it's unlike anything else in St. louis. END
BEGIN NOW Provided by a couple of buddies who both bring something to the table. END
BEGIN NOW woman THE OWNERS ARE BRIAN HARDESTY AND Joel Crespo. END
BEGIN NOW Adobo and a calamansi cooler. END
BEGIN NOW And Brian brings the culinary chops. END
BEGIN NOW I'm plating a chicken adobo. END

BEGIN NOW Oh, I wasn't expecting that. END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t expecting it to by syrupy. END
BEGIN NOW You know, it doesn't taste bad, but, man, it was way more viscous than I thought it was gonna be. END
BEGIN NOW okay, so next is black sesame oil, Paprika, sugar, some kosher salt, and then last is Thai chilies. END
BEGIN NOW They're smokin' hot so we don't use a lot of 'em. END
BEGIN NOW No, dot do that. END

BEGIN NOW This is an appetizer? this is served on tortillas? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW we just cut slices of watermelon, and they're supposed to be treated like chips. END
BEGIN NOW Supposed to be treated like chips, whoo a little spicy. END
BEGIN NOW [speaking indistinctly] The crab is still in its lump state. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW The creative side of the whole thing is how well the watermelon pairs with it. END
BEGIN NOW It's a nice counterbalance. END
BEGIN NOW It's all spectrums of the flavor profile. END
BEGIN NOW A citrus, vinegar, a little bit of sweet, a little bit of heat. END
BEGIN NOW That's a little more sophisticated than I expect to find out of a food truck on the side of the road in St. louis, Missouri. END
BEGIN NOW Bananas. and bananas is good. END
BEGIN NOW The watermelon is just so unusual. it's marvelous. END
BEGIN NOW It's a really great summery time dish, definitely in the top tier of food trucks in St. louis. END

BEGIN NOW One of these kids is doing their own thing. END

BEGIN NOW The highlight of the show definitely is that chorizo. END
BEGIN NOW All right, fresh chorizo and pears. oh. END

BEGIN NOW Let's get it going. all right. END
BEGIN NOW we slice our garlic fresh. END
BEGIN NOW Every time you make this dish? END
BEGIN NOW Add your milk. actually your milk. END
BEGIN NOW  the whole milk? yep. END
BEGIN NOW Is that my salt or your salt? that's my salt. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly stir in the semolina flour. END
BEGIN NOW And this is so we don't get clumpage. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW when we start getting toward the end, then we just dump it all in. END
BEGIN NOW My efforts at making this un-lumpo-licious, and he just goes and just dumps everybody in the pool. END
BEGIN NOW I like how it just became you I'm doing all the stirring. END
BEGIN NOW I could've had you do something that required de-blinging. END
BEGIN NOW nice color out of that. END

BEGIN NOW And in the fridge and hold it until it gets ordered. END
BEGIN NOW we have pans here. END
BEGIN NOW AND YOU GET THREE PER ORDER. END
BEGIN NOW It gets covered in a mushroom sauce, a little salt, lots of black pepper, fresh thyme. okay. END
BEGIN NOW All right, we're gonna add our beef stock. END
BEGIN NOW You make it yourself? END
BEGIN NOW We do. sauce is reducing. add butter. END
BEGIN NOW ooh, look at that. END
BEGIN NOW we gotta get 'em off here onto a plate. END
BEGIN NOW And then pour this over the top of the roman gnocchi. END
BEGIN NOW Finish it off with a little asiago, provolone, Romano and Parmesan. END
BEGIN NOW THERE YOU GO. [whistles] this is mega flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Super creamy. END
BEGIN NOW But because of the way you crisp it up, it reminds me of polenta. END
BEGIN NOW The gravy that goes along with it is simple, yet, wow, that's a lot of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think I've ever had anything like THIS. NICE JOB. woman ROMAN GNOCCHI. END
BEGIN NOW woman A DIFFERENT KIND OF GNOCCHI Than I've ever had before delicious. END

BEGIN NOW Chef and owner Howard kirk shrimp piri-piri. END
BEGIN NOW every single thing is made to order. And totally from scratch, like fresh-baked END
BEGIN NOW Every day, sometimes twice a day. END
BEGIN NOW With one of my all-time favorites, home-cured tasso. END
BEGIN NOW It tastes like spiced bacon. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make ours out of, it looks like the loin. loin, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW typically, it would be just cut off and chucked. END
BEGIN NOW Just cut it a little bit thicker into the loin. END
BEGIN NOW Leave some meat connected to the fat. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna be made into the tasso. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so what's the first step? END
BEGIN NOW this is just a flat-out sugar-and-salt dry cure? END
BEGIN NOW mat it on there. END
BEGIN NOW Now this is gonna go in here, and how long are we gonna let this cure? END
BEGIN NOW days under refrigeration, it's gonna start to pull out some of that moisture. END
BEGIN NOW You have to babysit it both days. END
BEGIN NOW You have to drain all the fluids out of it. END
BEGIN NOW After draining it, you would re-massage the sugar and salt. then what happens? END
BEGIN NOW Rinse it under cold water. END
BEGIN NOW you CAN see HOW IT BECOMES A LOT MORE DENSE. It almost becomes a little bit dried out. END
BEGIN NOW And now is gonna come the spice mixture. END
BEGIN NOW This really draws out the balance END
BEGIN NOW onion powder END
BEGIN NOW and allspice. END
BEGIN NOW get it all mixed up together. END
BEGIN NOW Now how long is this gonna stay on the pork? END
BEGIN NOW Three days. END
BEGIN NOW So that goes back into a plastic bag. END
BEGIN NOW It hangs out for another three days. END
BEGIN NOW at this point, you just wipe it. END
BEGIN NOW Just brush it off a little bit so it's not cakey and falling off. exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Five days later? five days later. END
BEGIN NOW so now we just take some thin slices of it. END
BEGIN NOW you're a good slicer. END
BEGIN NOW a quick sauté. END
BEGIN NOW gotta hear the sizzle. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so this is just a little crisp on both sides? yep. END
BEGIN NOW So almost treating this a little bit like bacon. yep. END
BEGIN NOW This is a typical serving? yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Like Niagara mouth right now. END
BEGIN NOW Howard WE'RE GONNA PUT IT ON SOME PEASANT Bread. END
BEGIN NOW so give it a little crust on both sides. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, make it nice and warm. add our tasso. END
BEGIN NOW And that's all she wrote. END
BEGIN NOW that's it, man. END
BEGIN NOW It's pork meets jerky meets salami meets smoked salmon. END
BEGIN NOW There's enough fat that it doesn't dry out in your mouth when you bite into it, a little bit of crunch on it, not overly salty. END
BEGIN NOW And do you know why the bread goes so great with this? END
BEGIN NOW Nice crust, real nice fresh flavor to it. END
BEGIN NOW Pork-liciousness. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent job, man. way to knock it out. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Tasso. crispy on the edges I enjoyed it. END
BEGIN NOW The way they cook their meat down, it's just perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Mm it's my favorite restaurant in Jacksonville. END
BEGIN NOW Gnocchi's ready to flip. END
BEGIN NOW It's a lot of work, but as soon as someone says, man, that was delicious, it's all worth it. that's what you're in this for. END

BEGIN NOW I dig it but don't worry. END

BEGIN NOW And it was actually introduced to me by my mom penny, and she said, I've got this thing, onion, tortilla, and cake. END
BEGIN NOW There's no way it was gonna taste good. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I tried it. it was dynamite. END
BEGIN NOW And this is my spin on it. END
BEGIN NOW Presenting the grilled onion and garlic tortilla stack. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna caramelize some onions first. END
BEGIN NOW And the key on this one is going low and slow and really letting those sugars develop and really bringing out that deep, rich color that you get when you caramelize the onions. END
BEGIN NOW Sweat a little, we get the butter coating it, and we're going to add some sugar to it. END
BEGIN NOW Really expedite the caramelization process. END
BEGIN NOW Keep on reducing. END
BEGIN NOW We draw that residual sugar out of the onion that's in there. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna get 'em to a nice golden brown. END
BEGIN NOW Next? END
BEGIN NOW a little food lube. END
BEGIN NOW Balsamic vinegar, cilantro, roasted garlic, parmesan cheese. END
BEGIN NOW I know it's an odd combination of ingredients, but trust me, it works. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add our onions. END
BEGIN NOW Now comes the power tool. END
BEGIN NOW whirring whirring stops Okay, this gat mixture guess where it goes next. END
BEGIN NOW Between fantastic locally made flour tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW A healthy portion here. spread it evenly. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make 12 layers of this. END
BEGIN NOW But I will tell you what you'll never find it anywhere else like this. END
BEGIN NOW Are you done with this already, betty Crocker? END
BEGIN NOW if it's not perfect, I DON'T WANT IT OUT OF MY KITCHEN. [laughing] We can't just make it, cut it, and go to the grill. END
BEGIN NOW It takes some time to actually set up. END
BEGIN NOW Let 'em set up overnight. END
BEGIN NOW Let it kind of congeal together, take it out, slice it, grill it both sides, a little crosshatch, then finish it in the oven. END
BEGIN NOW now the dipping sauce is the same mixture that we put inside when it's cool. END
BEGIN NOW Give it a little dunk. END
BEGIN NOW mouth full THE TEXTURE'S DYNAMITE. END
BEGIN NOW The flavor is huge. END
BEGIN NOW Great handmade tortillas. smokiness, crispy. END
BEGIN NOW It's all about the caramelized onions. END
BEGIN NOW It's just an explosion of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW They always have something a little bit different from the norm. I mean, come on. END
BEGIN NOW When it comes to one of my places, would you expect anything else? END
BEGIN NOW Foods run into each other here in a great way. END
BEGIN NOW It's definitely full of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Just like it's been since I opened the joint with my business partner Steve Gruber in 1996. END
BEGIN NOW We would train the staff on how to cook and how to serve tables, and then eat at night END
BEGIN NOW We'd do construction all night long, get up in the morning, and back on food development. END
BEGIN NOW The idea was always really fresh food, contemporary food. END
BEGIN NOW And that no-holds-barred attitude has led to dishes like salmon cooked on a cedar plank with jalapeños and apricot preserves, baby-back ribs with a cherry barbecue sauce, and this righteous mixture of Asian and Mexican fusion. END
BEGIN NOW Order in sashimi won tacos. END
BEGIN NOW It's a cross between, uh, sushi and Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW I kind of began the invention of this recipe with my buddy Sammy Hagar in this kitchen, but Michael is gonna walk us through it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start off with ahi tuna. END
BEGIN NOW This is sushi-grade ahi? yes, it is. END
BEGIN NOW The key is to slice it thin, and not too thin, because we don't wanna bruise it, we don't wanna beat it up. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're ready for our salsa. END
BEGIN NOW Start out with jicama. END
BEGIN NOW So jicama's got that really nice crunch to it. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think it gets utilized enough. END
BEGIN NOW People are kinda scared of what this this crazy radish is. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful, fresh mango. END
BEGIN NOW Firm flesh. it's gonna burst with flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Red onion. cilantro. Asian sweet chili sauce. END
BEGIN NOW jalapeño we wanna give it a little bite, a little pepper. END
BEGIN NOW salt pulls out a little bit of the moisture, pulls out a little bit of the flavor, and you'll mix some of that with the ahi. END
BEGIN NOW just kinda mixing it up, letting the flavors marry a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW what were gonna do is let this sit. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna let it gather the flavors. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna take our wontons. END
BEGIN NOW These are thin. we don't wanna overdo them. END
BEGIN NOW Out 15 seconds, and we’ll be ready to go. END
BEGIN NOW And we're done. look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Nice and golden brown. let em drain off here. END
BEGIN NOW While these are cooling down, we're gonna go ahead and make the wasabi cream sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy cream. love this. END
BEGIN NOW Salt, sugar, lemon juice, rice vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW So a little acid component, a little sugar component, salt component, getting all the flavor proles, and now this right here this is the kicker. END
BEGIN NOW This is the heat component. END
BEGIN NOW Wasabi powder. sour cream to tighten it up. END
BEGIN NOW Then the whisking starts. END
BEGIN NOW The key is to whisk this up and let these flavors marry together. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh pea shoots, just like you love. END
BEGIN NOW We get 'em in daily. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna hit this with a little eel sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Eel sauce is really crazy. END
BEGIN NOW You're kinda thinking about of a thick, sticky soy sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna fill these tacos up. END
BEGIN NOW The wasabi cream on there that we just made. END
BEGIN NOW touch 'em with eel sauce one more time. END
BEGIN NOW And the final touch wasabi microgreens. END
BEGIN NOW as you know, guy, double gold medal winner, Sonoma county harvest fair. END
BEGIN NOW crunching mouth full THE CRUNCHY SHELL, THE FRESH Ahi, and it's got such a nice, big, bright flavor with the wasabi. END
BEGIN NOW And then the crunchy veg hands down, one of my favorite appetizers here, man. END
BEGIN NOW Sashimi won tacos there for you. END
BEGIN NOW it's definitely unusual. END
BEGIN NOW The wasabi sauce and the eel sauce give it a nice little kick. END
BEGIN NOW I get this all the time. I love it. END
BEGIN NOW Jim AND WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY. END
BEGIN NOW It's easy to get a nice compliment about your food when they don't have to pay! yeah! END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] END
BEGIN NOW Hey, batter, batter. swing, batter. END
BEGIN NOW This is a trick I'm gonna use, dude. END
BEGIN NOW Is serving up so new standards. END
BEGIN NOW Don't worry about this petite dancer's figure. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] I can go big when it’s chicken and dumpling time. END
BEGIN NOW To Steady Betty. II To Steady Betty. END
BEGIN NOW Fire it up! END
BEGIN NOW I'm about 20 minutes south of Norfolk, Virginia, in a town called Portsmouth or p-town, as the locals call it to check out an old-school hot dog joint. END
BEGIN NOW Now this used to be the hangout for the local high school. END
BEGIN NOW But the local high school closed about 20 years ago. END
BEGIN NOW Guess what. it's still the local hangout. END
BEGIN NOW welcome to Harvey’s hot dogs. END
BEGIN NOW One foot-long all the way cheese and kraut. END
BEGIN NOW The food is so delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Large barbecue with slaw. END
BEGIN NOW I like the menu here 'cause it's got hot dogs, hamburgers, barbecue. END
BEGIN NOW One large bean chili, pick up. END
BEGIN NOW Now the original Harvey’s has been serving up hot dogs since 1976. END
BEGIN NOW But when Richie and Michelle wood bought it in 2010, they dubbed it part deux END
BEGIN NOW You need a large chicken and dumpling, Shauna? END
BEGIN NOW That southern boy Jim pate grew up on. END
BEGIN NOW Irish accent WHERE YOU FROM, JIMMY? END
BEGIN NOW Carolina, originally. END
BEGIN NOW normal voice NORTH CAROLINA? AH. END
BEGIN NOW I guess when you're from north Carolina, you call it Carolina, and then everybody else is supposed to call themselves southern Carolina? that's it. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken and dumplings. END
BEGIN NOW If you think your mom made good chicken and dumpling, WA TILL YOU TRY THIS. END
BEGIN NOW That's a call-out to moms across the country. END
BEGIN NOW man WOW. THIS IS GOOD. END
BEGIN NOW So give me the rundown on your chicken and dumplings. okay. END
BEGIN NOW Start with, uh, flour. I'll go a little oregano. END
BEGIN NOW a little thyme action. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. a little salt. END
BEGIN NOW And now we'll add the chicken stock. END
BEGIN NOW So you're not only gonna be putting these dumplings into chicken stock, but you're gonna actually make the dumpling itself with that broth, so it's pretty yes. END
BEGIN NOW It's chicken on chicken. these a big hit? END
BEGIN NOW I make probably 2 or 3 gallons of it, you might as well call this Harvey’s house of chicken and dumplings. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] A little bench flour. there you go. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, batter, batter. swing, batter. END
BEGIN NOW Cutting these guys like this. END
BEGIN NOW You line 'em up like that. right. END
BEGIN NOW Pop that in the freezer. uh-huh. END
BEGIN NOW And then the next day it's way easier to take that frozen piece, pop it off, and throw it right in, instead of all this goo. END
BEGIN NOW And that's how we roll? yes. END
BEGIN NOW Let's make some stock. END
BEGIN NOW HIT IT. END
BEGIN NOW Go in with this. END
BEGIN NOW Boil this chicken, let it cool, and we're gonna shred it. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW THE FROZEN DUMPLING BATTER This is a trick I'm gonna use, dude. END
BEGIN NOW tap 'em off and throw 'em on in. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna boil 'em for about 30, 45 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW So these start cooking, you put those on the back, and then start the soup on the front? yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Start with a little butter. END
BEGIN NOW Carrots first 'cause they take longer. END
BEGIN NOW Celery. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW A little onion. onion! END
BEGIN NOW What I'll do next is I'll make my roux right in the pot. a little roux on it. okay. END
BEGIN NOW And I thought you were just a hot dog guy. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Stock. teamwork. END
BEGIN NOW A little heavy whip. END
BEGIN NOW Slow simmer maybe 20, 30 minutes, get it nice and hot and thick finished. END
BEGIN NOW The chicken soup is done. yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Now we pull the dumplings. yes. END
BEGIN NOW Aa strain these bad boys out. END
BEGIN NOW lookin' good. END
BEGIN NOW Now you go with the chicken. white and dark. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, it's nice and hearty. END
BEGIN NOW Now we serve it up. END
BEGIN NOW Don't worry about this petite dancer's figure. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] I can go big when it's chicken and dumpling time. END
BEGIN NOW Go right here. END
BEGIN NOW  END
BEGIN NOW it's not all shredded. END
BEGIN NOW Veggies cooked down right into the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW got a little tenderness to it. END
BEGIN NOW You get a little bit of the thyme coming through that dumpling. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome job. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken and dumplings, pick up. END

BEGIN NOW putting a flavorful twist on traditional comfort. END
BEGIN NOW That is a bomb grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW So, I think everybody knows by now, I went to college here in Las Vegas, and I'm about a 1/2 mile off The Strip. END

BEGIN NOW Chicken teriyaki rice. Sheridan's an amazing chef. END
BEGIN NOW That'd be Sheridan Su, who worked at kitchens from New York to Los Angeles before rolling the dice in Vegas in 2011. END
BEGIN NOW They started off as a food truck. END
BEGIN NOW And then he had a little kiosk that was in the middle of a beauty salon, and now he's got a full kitchen and a full restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW One Pork Belly Bao! END

BEGIN NOW A Chinese steamed bun with marinated pork belly total goodness. END
BEGIN NOW Air rushing So, this is how loud it's gonna be the whole time? END
BEGIN NOW We're in a wind tunnel! What are we making?! END
BEGIN NOW We're making Pork Belly Bao! All right, man, get into it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start with a marinade 2 cups of soy sauce. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. 4 cups of water. END
BEGIN NOW And brown sugar. Garlic powder and green onion. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. So, let that simmer down? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. I said, Let it simmer down! We're gonna pour it right on top of the pork. END
BEGIN NOW You have to let it cool down or you're gonna poach it Yes. And then I'll cover it. END
BEGIN NOW Now, this will marinate for 24 hours, then go in the oven? END
BEGIN NOW For three hours, 300 degrees. END
BEGIN NOW And then what's going on here with the pork? END
BEGIN NOW The pork we'll put a pan over it just to compress it. END
BEGIN NOW So, we'll put it into our fridge overnight. END
BEGIN NOW And from here, we'll take the pans out. END
BEGIN NOW So, we'll take this by out, right onto the cutting board, where I'll just trim off the edges. END
BEGIN NOW Got it. Cut them into nice blocks. END
BEGIN NOW So, we'll sear that off in a pan? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Brown it on both sides. END
BEGIN NOW All right, now, what are we doing? END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna chop the preserved mustard greens. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna go ahead and sauté them. END
BEGIN NOW Got it. END
BEGIN NOW So, first, the oil, garlic, onion. END
BEGIN NOW And in goes the mustard green. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] And a little END
BEGIN NOW Sweet soy sauce. END

BEGIN NOW Thai roll. Put the pork belly right on top. END
BEGIN NOW On top of that, gets preserved mustard greens. END
BEGIN NOW And add crushed peanuts. END
BEGIN NOW And then finally cilantro right on top of that. END

BEGIN NOW Luscious and delicious and outstanding and sighs END
BEGIN NOW It's like the ultimate slider, right? END

BEGIN NOW Blt! END
BEGIN NOW Sheridan's made a reputation of taking American food and giving a little Asian twist to it. END
BEGIN NOW Short-rib grilled cheese! END
BEGIN NOW The short-rib grilled-cheese sandwich is a great example of that. END
BEGIN NOW Short-rib grilled cheese? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. In an Asian bistro? END
BEGIN NOW In an Asian bistro. END
BEGIN NOW When we started this restaurant, it was a diner, so we kept a lot of the diner dishes, and we threw in a lot of Asian twists to it. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so, we're gonna trim this down. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna take all the fat and some of the skin off, and then we're gonna cut it right through the bone. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, this is on the bone, too? Great. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna give this a nice sear till it's brown on all sides. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] So, after the short ribs are done browning, we're gonna put it right into the pan. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of work for a grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW On top of that, we're gonna put our marinade. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Let's start with Cola. END
BEGIN NOW Really? It's my grandma's secret. END
BEGIN NOW No, I got it. And add rice wine. END
BEGIN NOW Soy sauce. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of water, and add ginger. END
BEGIN NOW Garlic and green onions. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna let that braise for three hours, 300 degrees, till it falls off the bone. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, that's done. END
BEGIN NOW Nice. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start with the onion ja A little bit of oil. We're going with the red onions. END
BEGIN NOW We'll add a little bit of honey to help it caramelize. END
BEGIN NOW And add a little bit of brown sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa! END
BEGIN NOW Give that a stir. A little red wine. END
BEGIN NOW And we'll finish it with balsamic vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW Another one of those famous Asian ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Some black pepper and salt. END
BEGIN NOW That'll be the onion jam going for the grilled cheese we're having at the Asian bistro in a casino in Las Vegas. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. You hear it every day. END
BEGIN NOW So, I wanted a couple of nice slices of sourdough. END
BEGIN NOW Is it a butter sandwich? END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] So, this goes right into the pan. END
BEGIN NOW American cheese, cheddar cheese, and Swiss cheese. END
BEGIN NOW So, the short ribs that we have shredded. END
BEGIN NOW Again, a spoonful of this onion jam. END
BEGIN NOW We'll just mix this all together, and then this goes right on top of the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of short rib. END
BEGIN NOW So, we'll just let that cook slowly, and Put in a little salad and a little vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW Our sauce, marinara. END
BEGIN NOW Nicely done, my friend. END
BEGIN NOW The bread nice and crunchy. END
BEGIN NOW I like you put a lot of butter on there. END
BEGIN NOW The onion marmalade is what makes it. END
BEGIN NOW Your short rib is seasoned perfectly, and you get a ton. END
BEGIN NOW That is a bomb grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW All right, ort rib grilled cheese. END
BEGIN NOW I can't decide whether to just take small bites or shove the whole thing into my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW And this is actually what I eat every time. END
BEGIN NOW It's the best. END
BEGIN NOW Roasted Duck B. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not just raving on because it's bloody television, mate. END

BEGIN NOW What is the type of food that you make? What's the specialty? END
BEGIN NOW Got a little bit of everything going on. END

BEGIN NOW That's good slaw. It's that celery root. END
BEGIN NOW close call. END
BEGIN NOW Now time for the cauliflower steak. END
BEGIN NOW He's gonna cut the center out of this cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW Little olive oil, salt, and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Correct. END
BEGIN NOW Onto that hot plancha. END
BEGIN NOW And how are we serving this? On a slider? END
BEGIN NOW On a slider with blue cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Little buffalo sauce. END
BEGIN NOW And the slaw. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna take the finished steaks, stack them up nice for you. END
BEGIN NOW And then just a little bit of crumbled blue cheese. END
BEGIN NOW And then the scallions. END
BEGIN NOW That's all she wrote. END
BEGIN NOW So, I got to warn you. It's a little messy. END
BEGIN NOW No END
BEGIN NOW This is good really good. What are you tasting? END
BEGIN NOW Great heat from the cauliflower. END
BEGIN NOW Nice and tender, not mushy. Love the char. END
BEGIN NOW The celery root slaw got awesome texture. END

BEGIN NOW Real good. END
BEGIN NOW I got this. All right. Let's see this. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think? END
BEGIN NOW It's amazing. END
BEGIN NOW It's such a unique idea, I had to try it. END
BEGIN NOW It's my favorite. END
BEGIN NOW It's perfectly tangy, crunchy, and spicy. END
BEGIN NOW Like, you forget you're eating a vegetable. END
BEGIN NOW And folks are willing to chase this all over town for it. END
BEGIN NOW He's very easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW They're very prevalent on Facebook, Twitter. END
BEGIN NOW He's definitely one the best. END
BEGIN NOW I like their gourmet approach to the taco. END
BEGIN NOW Like this one, straight out of India. END
BEGIN NOW Two chana masala tacos. END
BEGIN NOW I would never think to put chana masala inside of a taco. END
BEGIN NOW It's amazing. END
BEGIN NOW All right. What are we making next? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna do a chana masala dish over apricot and Medjool date couscous. END
BEGIN NOW Never heard of that, either. END
BEGIN NOW Right over the top. END
BEGIN NOW All right, Dave. Let's get started. END
BEGIN NOW Israeli couscous. So, this will be the base. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of like pasta balls. END
BEGIN NOW Toasted almond slivers here. END
BEGIN NOW Smoked tomatoes. Little bit of apricots here. END
BEGIN NOW The Medjool date. Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Cilantro. Fresh-squeezed lemon juice. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're just gonna mix this here up. END
BEGIN NOW So, next, we're gonna do the chana masala. END
BEGIN NOW The chana masala. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start with olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW Onions This is traditional mirepoix. END
BEGIN NOW Carrots and celery, as well. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is about as traditional as it comes. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. A little garlic. Smelling good already. END
BEGIN NOW Coriander next, curry powder. END
BEGIN NOW Now let that toast up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Go in with our chickpeas. END
BEGIN NOW Or garbanzo bean. Not your favorite? END
BEGIN NOW Not the best bean. [laughs] Not the best bean in the world. END
BEGIN NOW He just chucked it out the door. END
BEGIN NOW Coconut milk first. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna get some lime in there. END
BEGIN NOW And then we'll just mix that up. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna hit it with a little salt and pepper and let it all come together. END
BEGIN NOW So, let this reduce about 20 or 30 minutes, and then we eat some tacos. Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Just get a I'm telling you, you've done your homework, and this is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW I'm getting a lot of that great rich flavor coming through from the coconut milk, and, all of a sudden, I just got a little bit of the slivered almond, and then I just got a little bit of the tang of the apricot come through. END
BEGIN NOW This is really, really good. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I'm glad you like it. That's for sure. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! Do you need another one? END
BEGIN NOW Muffled I didn't like it. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter]the chana masalas. END
BEGIN NOW This just ha the right touch of curry seasoning in it. END
BEGIN NOW All the flavors just come together. END
BEGIN NOW They never miss a beat. END
BEGIN NOW This variety that I've had today is pretty wild. END
BEGIN NOW Honestly, I would have never tried this had I not been on this show and had this opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW You find The Tin Kitchen, you're on the right track. END
BEGIN NOW You'll find Clint Bowyer. END
BEGIN NOW Some of the best food you'll have anywhere, whether it's out of a truck or out of a brick-and-mortar restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW Hands down, the best in town. END
BEGIN NOW that's it for this special edition of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives here in Charlotte, North Carolina, but don't you worry. END
BEGIN NOW There's funky joints all over this country. END

BEGIN NOW Pork sisig with steamed rice. END
BEGIN NOW and Chef Gil Payumo END
BEGIN NOW Order for Dave. Hey, Dave. END
BEGIN NOW back in 2010, they started mixing Mexican with get this a sour pork Filipino dish called sisig. Originally, it's the pork head, cheeks, snout. END
BEGIN NOW We do a little cleaner version with the pork shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW And Gil stayed true to his grandfather's sisig recipe for the truck's signature dish. END
BEGIN NOW T pork sisig tacos. END
BEGIN NOW It's just so good. END
BEGIN NOW All right, man. Well, give me the low down. END
BEGIN NOW First, we're gonna start off with the pork shoulder, sliced up 1/4-inch thin. END
BEGIN NOW We got some soy sauce over here, some sugarcane vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW And this is what we do by hand. END
BEGIN NOW Let's go ahead and add some oil. END
BEGIN NOW Heat that up a little bit. Onions. Celery. END
BEGIN NOW Garlic Just sweat it, basically, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW And then add some tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add this shredded chicken. END
BEGIN NOW Basically, sauté that up a little bit more. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna add some chicken stock. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna take three of these. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW So, these are my blue-corn tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW I really just want to soften them up. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna take our shredded chicken that we just finished making. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna add some cheese inside. END
BEGIN NOW This that Chile Caribe sauce that we made. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna layer these right on top of each other, bring it over to the middle. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna throw these right on top. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit more. END
BEGIN NOW Throw some cheese, chopped onions. END
BEGIN NOW Toss this in the salamander 'cause we really want to melt this. END
BEGIN NOW Take this out. Nice melted cheese. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna add some delicious pinto beans, some of the rice. END
BEGIN NOW Dig in. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW This is hitting the spot. END
BEGIN NOW You can taste the flavors, especially the chili. END
BEGIN NOW Not super-salty, not rely hot. END

BEGIN NOW Excellent job. Thank you so much. END
BEGIN NOW The man. END
BEGIN NOW Here are your red-chile chicken enchiladas. END
BEGIN NOW And it's just got a whole bunch of flavors, and every bite gets better. END
BEGIN NOW This restaurant really represents traditional, local Hood. END
BEGIN NOW It blends a lot of different cultures. END
BEGIN NOW What he means It's a whole lot of goodness. END
BEGIN NOW See? END
BEGIN NOW It's always the girl to just sum it up. END
BEGIN NOW Both chuckle Great place. Great chef you have. END
BEGIN NOW Food's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW This has really been a great experience, and just the respect and the admiration for the chilies and what a role the chilies play in it, it's amazing. END
BEGIN NOW You got it. Thank you, brother. END
BEGIN NOW Up next END
BEGIN NOW Let it sing? [Hisses] We're headed south to Albuquerque END
BEGIN NOW For everybody at home, this is, Danger, Will Robinson. for what else? END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. Rustic Northern Italian. END
BEGIN NOW So, here I am, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW Now, this area right here kind of like a business park, lots of office buildings. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm here to check out a joint that is about as European as they come. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see. The wife, she's from Italy. END
BEGIN NOW The chef and husband, well, he's from France. END
BEGIN NOW And the food is off the hook. END
BEGIN NOW This is Torinos' @ Home. END
BEGIN NOW If I could, I'd be here every day and every night. END
BEGIN NOW It's like going back to Italy, to family. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause when Maxim and Daniela Bouneuo opened this joint back in 2010, they modeled it after those little family joints in Italy called trattorias. END
BEGIN NOW MAXIME: We don't want to be expensive. END
BEGIN NOW We don't want to be a fine dining. END
BEGIN NOW We want to serve honest food at an honest price. END
BEGIN NOW But that doesn't mean they're cutting any corners, especially with this house special END
BEGIN NOW Order in. A squid ink, please. END
BEGIN NOW a seafood dish with tender calamari and handmade pasta, dyed with a squirt of cuttlefish ink. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Andiamo! END
BEGIN NOW MAXIME: All right, so we start with semolina flour. END
BEGIN NOW 00 flour It's a very fine flour that we use for pastries, pasta. END
BEGIN NOW It makes a harder, drier, thinner product. END
BEGIN NOW Right. Salt. Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of squid ink, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Careful. It stains a lot. END
BEGIN NOW If you ever wanted to put permanent eyeliner like you're a football player you know, the shade control. END
BEGIN NOW You'll be good. END
BEGIN NOW Just a little dash of olive oil in there. END
BEGIN NOW Low speed. END
BEGIN NOW And stir water gently in there. END
BEGIN NOW And how long are we gonna let this mix? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, a few minutes just until they bind all together. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna speed it up a little. END
BEGIN NOW So, now we put the dough on the table, work it a little bit by hand. END
BEGIN NOW You see how black it is? END
BEGIN NOW Gorgeous. END
BEGIN NOW And then we'll roll it in the pasta roller. END
BEGIN NOW So, you roll it down about by 1/16 of an inch, and you keep rolling. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the color on that. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, that looks like asphalt. END
BEGIN NOW Nice shine to it. END
BEGIN NOW And then we pack them back on the machine. END
BEGIN NOW But this time, through the cutter. END
BEGIN NOW Gorgeous. Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're gonna prepare the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW So, we have a hot pan here. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna squeeze a little bit of olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna grab a couple calamari. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna slice our tubes, a few of the tentacles. END
BEGIN NOW Oil [sizzling] And we make some noise. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna let that sear a little. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Shallots and garlic. END
BEGIN NOW So, we let that sweat in there a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Heirloom tomatoes Those are coming from right around the corner. END
BEGIN NOW And at this point, I think we can start seasoning a little bit of salt. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh-cracked black. END
BEGIN NOW And we need to be patient. Let it sing. END
BEGIN NOW Let it sing? Hisses Once it sings, we're gonna add a little bit of pastis in there. END
BEGIN NOW Pastis? END
BEGIN NOW Pastis is a liqueur from the south of France. END
BEGIN NOW It's made with star anise. END
BEGIN NOW I think that's like liquid fennel! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that's awesome. Yeah? Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Clam broth. END
BEGIN NOW Get a good hand of pasta. END
BEGIN NOW All right. So, we sauté all that. Ah! END
BEGIN NOW So, a little pinch chive, a little tarragon, bell-pepper flakes. END
BEGIN NOW We're ready to eat. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW The sauce has all combined around that beautiful, squid-ink pasta. END
BEGIN NOW Mother, father, that's good. It's good? END
BEGIN NOW The calamari is so tender. END
BEGIN NOW All of these little components, just that little bit of chili flake at the end The tarragon, the parsley, the chive coming in. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think? END
BEGIN NOW That's fantastic. You like that? Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Fantastic, my friend. Nice job. END
BEGIN NOW Squid-ink pasta con calamari. END
BEGIN NOW It's wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW I love the squid ink because it's different, for one thing. END
BEGIN NOW A when we come back, more different END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna do a be cheek manicotti. END
BEGIN NOW with a deeper look into the French-Italian playbook. Sacré bleu. END
BEGIN NOW People come, and they're all, Where's your meatball? END
BEGIN NOW Where's your Alfredo? And some people would just leave, say, No, you're not Italian. To have the food from Italy, where I've never been, is nice, because I feel like I'm actually getting to enjoy it and enjoy the atmosphere and the ambiance. END
BEGIN NOW And some down-home recipes you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere outside of Italy. END
BEGIN NOW Weave a beef cheek manicotti right here. END
BEGIN NOW It's absolutely scrumptious and just melts in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW What are we into now? END
BEGIN NOW So, we're searing beef cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna do a beef cheek manicotti. END
BEGIN NOW Butter in the pan. END
BEGIN NOW Everything's better with butter. END
BEGIN NOW This is the French part coming out. END
BEGIN NOW Beef cheeks. Beef cheeks are the bomb! END
BEGIN NOW Little salt, little pepper. END
BEGIN NOW So they're nice and seared on both sides, okay? END
BEGIN NOW Lay them in our braising pan. END
BEGIN NOW Gorgeous. END
BEGIN NOW Next step is deglazing our pan with red wine. END
BEGIN NOW Get all that fat off the bottom of it. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna reduce the wine down a little bit In the meantime, we're gonna start sautéing our vegetable over there. END
BEGIN NOW Starting with onions, little garlic, carrots, and the celery, just to sweat all that a little bit, okay? END
BEGIN NOW Gonna put that on top of our cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW Gorgeous. END
BEGIN NOW And add a little tomato paste here and there. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add our flour. END
BEGIN NOW All that red wine goes in there. END
BEGIN NOW Cover it with a veal stock. END
BEGIN NOW Veal stock is done from veal bone. END
BEGIN NOW We use femur and knuckles. Roast em? END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Wrap it in foil, and how long in the oven? END
BEGIN NOW 5 hours. At? END
BEGIN NOW 500 degrees. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is out of the oven. END
BEGIN NOW Cools down a little bit so you can handle it. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna shred. END
BEGIN NOW See? Just like you would shred for a pulled-pork sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna add ricotta. END
BEGIN NOW Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese in there. END
BEGIN NOW Bring a little bit of salt, some pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna make some more pasta. END
BEGIN NOW Again with the semolina, again with the 00. END
BEGIN NOW We're just not gonna add the squid ink. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW We rolled our pasta. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're gonna blanch it in our boiling water. END
BEGIN NOW Do you see the level of attention to detail just the way he takes the time to do all of this? END
BEGIN NOW Then what we want to do is shove them in ice water. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so now you need to spread that out a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Next we take our cooked pasta. END
BEGIN NOW We take our filling. END
BEGIN NOW We pipe a large chunk of filling in the center END
BEGIN NOW Holy schnike! END
BEGIN NOW and we roll. END
BEGIN NOW There we go! END
BEGIN NOW Like a sushi chef, the way he's rocking this. END
BEGIN NOW Little béchamel in the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW More Béchamel on top. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of the braising juice and some of the cheese mix. END
BEGIN NOW We put Fontina cheese, and we put Pecorino Romano. END
BEGIN NOW In the oven how long? END
BEGIN NOW About 10 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, it cooks in the oven and then finishes in the salamander? END
BEGIN NOW Here we go. END
BEGIN NOW Our little mix of herbs. END
BEGIN NOW Pepper, garlic oil. END
BEGIN NOW For everybody at home, this right here This is danger, Will Robinson. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] I'm gonna take this for a walk around the block. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not gonna burn myself. I'm learning. END
BEGIN NOW So that worked, huh? END
BEGIN NOW This is an awesome combination of the French richness END
BEGIN NOW and the Italian rustic. END
BEGIN NOW Decadent. END
BEGIN NOW It's simple. END
BEGIN NOW It's no filler, all thriller. END
BEGIN NOW Too legit to quit. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how he does it, but it's amazing. END
BEGIN NOW I cod sell my soul for this. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] So, the people that come here know it's the real deal. END
BEGIN NOW Is it the real deal? END
BEGIN NOW Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END

BEGIN NOW Lando? Lanzhao. END
BEGIN NOW He brings his culture, and he brings his love of cooking into each and every dish. END

BEGIN NOW Whoo! END
BEGIN NOW Our passion for motorcycles goes beyond just having a motorcycle-themed restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW We've actually started organizing fund-raisers to help downed motorcycle victims. END
BEGIN NOW The reason we called Mystery Diners is because motorcycle items that’ve been donated for our fund-raisers came up missing. END
BEGIN NOW If these motorcycle accessories are being stolen which we really think they are That's less money that we can raise for the fund-raisers to help the people in need. END
BEGIN NOW Our reputation is on the line. END
BEGIN NOW It's a big problem. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Charles Stiles, Mystery Diners Charles, Mike Thomas. END
BEGIN NOW This is my wife. Berenice. END
BEGIN NOW Berenice, pleasure to meet you. Nice meeting you. END
BEGIN NOW So, I got to tell you I love the bike theme you have in here. END
BEGIN NOW All these vintage motorcycles these are really cool. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW It's been a lot of work, but it's been a lot of fun. END
BEGIN NOW The community has just really embraced us, and so we've started a fund-raiser project for victims that have been seriously hurt in motorcycle accidents. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that's a very worthy cause. END
BEGIN NOW So, tell me how that works. END
BEGIN NOW The motorcycle enthusiasts bring in motorcycle accessories, and we raffle them off to make money for them. END
BEGIN NOW That's great. So, what seems to be the problem? END
BEGIN NOW Why did you call my company? END
BEGIN NOW Well, we've noticed that some of the items for the motorcycle raffles came up missing. END
BEGIN NOW So, customers are telling you that they brought in items and you're not finding them in your inventory is what it sounds like. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW And we've also noticed that some of the expensive items we have on display in the restaurant have disappeared. END
BEGIN NOW So do you guys have any suspects? END
BEGIN NOW I definitely want to take a look at my manager and my wait staff. END
BEGIN NOW Well, we'll definitely start with your manager as well as work our way through your entire staff. END
BEGIN NOW And it's also a good idea to keep an eye on customer because they could be responsible as well. END
BEGIN NOW Whether it's staff or customers, we're not sure. END
BEGIN NOW We need to find out. END
BEGIN NOW For this sting, Mystery Diners will focus on Joseph, the restaurant's manager who END

BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Calm down, G. You're dancing. END
BEGIN NOW Here we go. Get it out. END
BEGIN NOW Forget about it. END
BEGIN NOW That's the best compliment you can get. END
BEGIN NOW To me, one of the keys to this that I'm really digging is the simplicity. END
BEGIN NOW You execute the pasta perfectly, you make your own sauces. END
BEGIN NOW But what makes the is so great is with so many flavors on the plate, there's no reason to make it any more complex. END
BEGIN NOW Just let the simplicity of it shine through. END
BEGIN NOW d that's really what I enjoy the most. END
BEGIN NOW Man, it all works well together. It's phenomenal. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job, Pepe. Thank you. END

BEGIN NOW And then there's that other thing. END
BEGIN NOW This I can do easily. END
BEGIN NOW So, I'm here in Jackson, Wyoming, and I'm about two miles from the center of town over in kind of the locals' area. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when you think of Jackson, what do you think of? END
BEGIN NOW Well, of course, outdoor sports. END
BEGIN NOW But when it comes to food, what kind of food? END

BEGIN NOW Marinated shrimp tacos. END
BEGIN NOW You can tell that what they're making, they're making because they love what they're doing. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken mole plate. END

BEGIN NOW That's what you get here. END
BEGIN NOW That someone is chef and owner Andy Parette, a So-Cal dude who left behind the surf to open up this mountain taqueria in 2001. END
BEGIN NOW Were you always in the restaurant business? END

BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW Done. Good. END
BEGIN NOW This is about as old-school real deal where did this one come from? END
BEGIN NOW Down in Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW This is the only one in Jackson. I'm pretty sure of it. END
BEGIN NOW That's gangster. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna roll the masa into balls. END
BEGIN NOW Over the plastic. END
BEGIN NOW You don't press it too hard. END
BEGIN NOW You want to keep them a little thick. END
BEGIN NOW All right. So, you take it. END
BEGIN NOW And when we make the sope, especially with this tinga chicken, it's gonna have some moisture to it. END
BEGIN NOW So this kind of gives it a little well to sit in. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Okay. Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW Now we make the chicken tinga. Hit it. END
BEGIN NOW Canola oil. END
BEGIN NOW Heat up julienned onions. END
BEGIN NOW So, the onions are caramelized. END

BEGIN NOW And then we'll puree them. Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And then we add a little cumin. Ground cumin. END
BEGIN NOW Let 'er rip. END
BEGIN NOW So, now we're gonna take the blended-up tomatillo and jalapeños and refry it in the pot. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna add the chicken stock and our salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW While that's cooking, I'm gonna cut up our pork. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna cook it in this pan with what? END

BEGIN NOW And the pork is ridiculous, fall-apart tender. END
BEGIN NOW Snap! END
BEGIN NOW There's your posole verde. END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of addicting. END

BEGIN NOW Oh, that's outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't had that puffy type of Yorkshire pudding in 20-some years. END
BEGIN NOW It's all in the homemade mashed potatoes WITH THE YORKSHIRE PUDNG, A little of the whole-grain mustard, and then you get that really tender puff from the pastry. END
BEGIN NOW it's really more gravy, please. END
BEGIN NOW For you, anything. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that is good stuff. fantastic job. END

BEGIN NOW We're gonna put a little bit of the dry rub on it. END
BEGIN NOW And this dish is called what? END
BEGIN NOW Pork Antonio. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna let those sit there and just take a little bit of a marinade from the dry rub, just let that kind of soak in the flavor. END
BEGIN NOW While we do that, what's up? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna top that with some habanero-pepper jelly. END
BEGIN NOW Getting all culinary gangster on me. All right. END

BEGIN NOW Anchor down. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, nice and thin. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, whee, oh END
BEGIN NOW Ohh, oh END
BEGIN NOW Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna link 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Now, how are we gonna smoke 'em? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna hang 'em on a stainless-steel dowel over embers. END
BEGIN NOW They're gonna sit there overnight. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of heat, little bit of smoke. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna grill these. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the sausage after being smoked and grilled. END
BEGIN NOW Serve it with some tortillas, fire-roasted onions, and then fire-roasted salsa. END
BEGIN NOW So, everything on here was cooked on that same grill. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing about that I don't love. END
BEGIN NOW It's a Yucatán hot dog. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of salt, touch of spice, great meat-to-fat ratio. END
BEGIN NOW Definitely get the wood and the smoke. END
BEGIN NOW That's fantastic. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Longaniza asada. END
BEGIN NOW This is excellent. END
BEGIN NOW Just intense flavor something different like I've never had before. END
BEGIN NOW Panuchos. END
BEGIN NOW Super authentic, really authentic. END
BEGIN NOW We're half Hispanic, so this tastes just like my grandma makes. END
BEGIN NOW I love it. END
BEGIN NOW This is also a great community space. END
BEGIN NOW There's other small, locally owned businesses. END
BEGIN NOW All centered around a main eating and hangout space I come he to be able to spend my dollar with really awesome mom-and-pop shops a lot of really indigenous recipes. END
BEGIN NOW So, what's the next dish? END
BEGIN NOW Panucho. END
BEGIN NOW It's one of my favorites, and I always order them. END
BEGIN NOW And I'm sticking around to try 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! Coming up next. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my gosh! END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we're back at Chichén Itza here in Los Angeles, and I got to tell you something. END
BEGIN NOW It's taken me that much time to recover from the fantastic longaniza asada. END
BEGIN NOW Which is just the start of a long list of real-deal dishes straight from the Yucatán. END
BEGIN NOW 's very unique. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, 's not your typical Mexican-food restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever had Yucatán food? No. END
BEGIN NOW This is like a free plane ticket. Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW It's a very different twist. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't necessarily call that Mexican ''od if you just sat it down in front of me. END
BEGIN NOW Say it has its own personality. END
BEGIN NOW Order up, table 12! END
BEGIN NOW The combinations are so delightful. END
BEGIN NOW And they have a really awesome modern spin on some really ancient dishes. END
BEGIN NOW Panuchos. It's kind of like a tostada. END
BEGIN NOW But it's infused with black-bean paste. END
BEGIN NOW And it's delicious. END
BEGIN NOW All right, what do we do with this turkey? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna boil the legs, and we're gonna sous-vide the breast. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause that's what you see every day in a little kiosk Yucatán joint here in Los Angeles. END
BEGIN NOW To cook the legs in a stock pot, we put water END
BEGIN NOW salt, garlic, oregano. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Bay leaves END
BEGIN NOW black pepper cilantro END
BEGIN NOW wings. legs and thighs. END
BEGIN NOW Like a little court bouillon. Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna prepare the turkey breast for its sous-vide cooking. END
BEGIN NOW Let's get into this. Kosher salt, both sides. END
BEGIN NOW Take a sous-vide bag. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of cilantro in there. END
BEGIN NOW And this is it for the seasoning. That's it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna vacuum this? We are. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW 150 degrees? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW How long? 2 1/2 hours. END
BEGIN NOW Got it. This is not boiling. END
BEGIN NOW This is simmering, but it's precise. END
BEGIN NOW Now, the beauty about sous-vide is, you can go for long periods of time and we're talking days to where it's so tender that when you open it out of the bag, it'll just fall apart. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna make the tortillas now for the panuchos. Spanish accent Tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna make little balls of masa. END
BEGIN NOW In it goes. END
BEGIN NOW Normal vice So, why is this going to puff up open? END
BEGIN NOW Mine don't often puff up. END
BEGIN NOW Once both layers are cooked evenly, you press down on the tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW It generates steam and puffs up. END
BEGIN NOW And there it is. END
BEGIN NOW You learn something new every day, baby. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Open it up. END
BEGIN NOW Some black-bean puree. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Cover the hole. You spread it out. END
BEGIN NOW Love it. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna fry 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Double-cooked tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW All right, here we are, Chef. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we're gonna make the achiote marinade to paint our turkeys. Paint our turkeys. END
BEGIN NOW And put 'em on the grill. And put 'em on the grill. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we're gonna start with some achiote paste and then fresh, sour oranges. END
BEGIN NOW I love it. END

BEGIN NOW You felt comfortable coming back multiple times. END
BEGIN NOW That's what we made here. END
BEGIN NOW But with all my time on the road, you know I need a solid team to back me up, and I got that, led by Chef Tony Leitera. END

BEGIN NOW Next up. We got your toasted bun here. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start with our donkey sauce. END

BEGIN NOW You're taking a step out of Cincinnati, and you're walking into something completely different. END

BEGIN NOW That's due to owner Jean-Fncois Flechet END
BEGIN NOW Nicoise is up. END
BEGIN NOW who was raised in a tiny Belgian village before coming stateside, opening this place in 2011. END
BEGIN NOW His specialty here, what else, the Belgian waffle. END
BEGIN NOW Plain waffle. Fruit-and-cream waffle. END
BEGIN NOW I love these waffles so much. END
BEGIN NOW They're crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. END
BEGIN NOW Do people understand what a Belgian waffle is? END
BEGIN NOW I think here, everybody calls a waffle a Belgian waffle. Right. END
BEGIN NOW What we make is very dense, and it's made from a thick dough. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, well, let's get after 'em, man. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna start with the flour, salt, yeast, Mix it up. We'll add the butter. END
BEGIN NOW Eggs. END
BEGIN NOW Raining chickens. END
BEGIN NOW Milk, vanilla. END
BEGIN NOW And the key is this compressed beet sugar, and you cannot find it locally, so when I got started, I cashed out my IRA, and I bought 10 tons of sugar. END
BEGIN NOW You got to be related to my family somehow. END
BEGIN NOW It has a special texture. It has a special melting point. END
BEGIN NOW That doesn't smell like any waffle dough, batter that I've ever made. END
BEGIN NOW This gets done mixing. END
BEGIN NOW We portion it END
BEGIN NOW cut it END
BEGIN NOW put it in the holding tray, It goes in the refrigerator. Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And then it goes to the waffle maker. END
BEGIN NOW at is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW So you have somebody make this thing for you. END
BEGIN NOW The one that comes from Belgium, really not sturdy enough. END
BEGIN NOW This one, you can bang it all you want. END
BEGIN NOW So the sugar still never dissolved. END
BEGIN NOW Still just big chunks a lot of sugar. END
BEGIN NOW We put the balls of dough on the waffle iron. END
BEGIN NOW And we just close it. Gravity will do the work. END
BEGIN NOW And then 3 minutes, you're gonna get a beautiful waffle. END
BEGIN NOW Just serve in wax paper. END
BEGIN NOW That's the way we That's the way you get it in Belgium. Belgium. END
BEGIN NOW That's outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW I love the little crystals that you get. END
BEGIN NOW You know, you get a little bit of that crunch inside of there. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, that's crazy. END
BEGIN NOW This is the way to get your kid up in the morning on Sunday and have him mow the lawn and wax the car and shave the dog. END
BEGIN NOW Want a waffle? Yeah! END
BEGIN NOW Fruit-and-cream Belgian waffle. END
BEGIN NOW Any other waffle you've ever had in your life it put to shame. END
BEGIN NOW This is my cousin Jeff and his son T. J. END
BEGIN NOW What did you think, TJ? Whenever you bite into it, it's not the normal waffle. END
BEGIN NOW You can just eat 'em plain. END
BEGIN NOW You don't need any syrup. END
BEGIN NOW FLECHET: Plain waffle. END
BEGIN NOW Did you cook at home in Belgium? END
BEGIN NOW I never cooked a waffle until I started the business. END
BEGIN NOW That's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW My background is in computer science. END
BEGIN NOW Computer program and a recipe very similar. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, no, they are. The special steps, you follow them. END
BEGIN NOW And his recipes go way beyond the waffle. END
BEGIN NOW Carbonnade is up. END
BEGIN NOW The carbonnade's just got kind of those smoky flavors, sorta like comfort food, almost. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, what are we making now? END
BEGIN NOW We are gonna make carbonnade. END
BEGIN NOW What is carbonnade? END
BEGIN NOW Traditional Belgian beef stew. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it. Beef tallow. END
BEGIN NOW Guy Fieri: you got to love some beef tallow - you know, rendered beef fat. END
BEGIN NOW Then let's add the onions. END
BEGIN NOW Garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Bacon. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna take it off the heat END
BEGIN NOW So we can sear the meat. so we sear the meat exactly. END
BEGIN NOW What type of meat? END
BEGIN NOW It's a mix of top and round chuck. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW Salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW We add onion, garlic, and bacon back in the pot, stir it all together, and add the flour. END
BEGIN NOW Got it. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna build a little roux off of the fat. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW The apple cider vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW The beer. Which type of beer is this? END
BEGIN NOW It's a good dark ale. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And then some Dijon. END
BEGIN NOW This is what we call in Belgian sirop de Liège. END
BEGIN NOW Sirop END
BEGIN NOW de Liège. de Liège. END
BEGIN NOW This is really the secret of the dish. END
BEGIN NOW They gather all the apples, all the pear, put them in a big container, reduce it, and we use that as a natural sweetener. END
BEGIN NOW And last but not least, the bouquet garni? END
BEGIN NOW Bouquet garni. END
BEGIN NOW So, parsley, bay leaf, thyme, and peppercorns. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're gonna let it cook for about an hour and a half. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna place some frites on the plate, serve the carbonnade. END
BEGIN NOW Hmm. END
BEGIN NOW And then we add just a little bit of pickled onions, and this is our chipotle mayonnaise. END
BEGIN NOW Mm. END
BEGIN NOW It's tender, but not falling apart, and there's rich, dark beer being used in there, so you get that note. END
BEGIN NOW And are you supposed to dip the frites in the mayonnaise, or you dip it in this, or END
BEGIN NOW You can alternate. END
BEGIN NOW Comme ci, comme ça? END
BEGIN NOW Comme ci, comme ça. END
BEGIN NOW It's not super heavy. It's not overpowering. END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW Carbonnade is up. END
BEGIN NOW It's made just like in Belgium. END
BEGIN NOW I lived there for a long time, and they nailed it. END
BEGIN NOW To find a traditional Belgian place like yourself is outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW We're hanging out in Cincinnati on Vine Street at the Taste of Belgium. END
BEGIN NOW You got to come back. END
BEGIN NOW I think we're gonna make pretzels, and my recommendation would be, add some beer cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome back. END
BEGIN NOW We're hanging out in Cincinnati, Ohio, at the Taste of Belgium, and this man served me waffles like I've never had before. END
BEGIN NOW Out of bounds. Chef, what are we making next? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make some Belgian pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, get going. END
BEGIN NOW Yeast, sugar, water. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna give it a whisk, get it bubbling, and then add the beer. END
BEGIN NOW Then the flour. END
BEGIN NOW Salt. END
BEGIN NOW And then we put the dough hook in. Argh, Captain. END
BEGIN NOW How long we let this go? END
BEGIN NOW For about 8 to 10 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Then we portion it out. END
BEGIN NOW and then just cut through it. END
BEGIN NOW ok at this And then we're gonna flatten it, roll it. END
BEGIN NOW Let me see this little, funky knot you do. END
BEGIN NOW It's the Belgian way. END
BEGIN NOW Everything that I don't understand, you call a Belgian way. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody knows the first thing about Belgium, so. Yeah, so you just say, Oh, that's how we do it in Belgium. All right, so, we'll let these proof how long? About two hours. END
BEGIN NOW They get boiled, brushed with egg wash, and then put in the oven 12 minutes at 425. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're going to make END
BEGIN NOW Beer cheese. END
BEGIN NOW We add cream cheese, Swiss cheese, smoked Gouda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and then some heavy cream. END
BEGIN NOW Put some water in there. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna put these in the water in the oven? END
BEGIN NOW That's correct, so that it doesn't burn. END
BEGIN NOW How long is this gonna go in? END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna go in for about 20 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW At? 350. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna add the beer. END
BEGIN NOW What we use is a raspberry-flavored Belgian beer. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And it adds a very unique flavor to the beer cheese. I can imagine. END
BEGIN NOW Cork pops Yahtzee! END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Hey! END
BEGIN NOW That's a party. END
BEGIN NOW Did that make the Jumbotron? [laughs] And then we're gonna finish blending. END
BEGIN NOW Serve that with a pretzel. END
BEGIN NOW Good idea. I come up with the all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW A little parsley. END
BEGIN NOW So, what we're gonna do with the pretzel is brush with a little bit of water and put some coarse salt on. END
BEGIN NOW The texture on the pretzel is real authentic. END
BEGIN NOW Great crust on it. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, it just smells great. END
BEGIN NOW The beer cheese is rich, super flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW Do not think you're getting, you know, a side of nacho cheese dipping sauce. END
BEGIN NOW This is a meal. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding, sir. Very nice job. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW I love the Belgian beer cheese and pretzels. END
BEGIN NOW It's crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. END

BEGIN NOW Table 8, pastora, cochinita, two fish. END
BEGIN NOW I like to eat a lot of tacos. I like to drink a lot of beer. END
BEGIN NOW So I get to come here and do just that. END
BEGIN NOW It's a little more of a Southwest style of food. END
BEGIN NOW That south-of-the-border concept was the brainchild of brothers Joe and John Lanni and good buddy Alex Blust who opened this place in 2012. END
BEGIN NOW Record needle scratches What do you guys in Cincinnati know about great Mexican food? END
BEGIN NOW We wanted to be approachable, affordable, and fun. END
BEGIN NOW We thought tacos would be a really good vehicle for that. END
BEGIN NOW And the man behind these tantalizing tacos is Chef Chas Barracato. END
BEGIN NOW T short-rib tacos. END
BEGIN NOW Mainly, I just stick to the short rib 'cause they're just so good. END
BEGIN NOW It's a meatiness going on, and then you got that radicchio, which is bitter, just to cut it. END
BEGIN NOW It all equals out and tastes awesome. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make? END
BEGIN NOW We are going to make our short-rib marinade for our short-rib tacos. Give me the rundown, man. END
BEGIN NOW First, we're gonna take our roasted tomatoes. END

BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW So, the goal here is to just sear each side, get great crust all the way around. END
BEGIN NOW BARRACATO: Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW All right, buddy, next. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add cinnamon sticks, a few bay leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Let's add the marinade. END
BEGIN NOW Now, how long are we gonna let this braise in the oven? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna cook it at 350 for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. END
BEGIN NOW Take it. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Let's make a taco. Okay. END

BEGIN NOW And hit the crema and queso fresco. END
BEGIN NOW Pickled white onions. END
BEGIN NOW Cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW  And then we're gonna finish it off with slices of radish. END
BEGIN NOW It's got a lot of street taco going right there. END

BEGIN NOW Po'boy and half and half. END
BEGIN NOW Marcus is definitely bringing New Orleans to L. A. END
BEGIN NOW in a big way. END
BEGIN NOW And when Louisiana native Marcus Christiana-Beniger started looking for the right kitchen to turn out a New Orleans menu, well, it led him right to Chinatown. END
BEGIN NOW Southeast Louisiana We smoke a lot You name it Tasso seasoning ham, boudin, andouille. END
BEGIN NOW So, it's important to us that we have a smoker of some size, and any Chinese restaurant worth its salt is gonna have a large one. END
BEGIN NOW In 2014, he hit the jackpot. END
BEGIN NOW So, the main reason to get this joint is because of a big kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Big kitchen, large smoker. END
BEGIN NOW Echoing Can you hear me? END
BEGIN NOW Echoing No. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] Half and half po'boy. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sitting here with Miss Alice Wong, who was Miss Chinatown this year. END
BEGIN NOW How do the folks in Chinatown feel about this crazy Cajun opening up this joint in an old Chinese restaurant? END
BEGIN NOW It's awesome. END
BEGIN NOW It's definitely welcome. END

BEGIN NOW Now green Tabasco pepper. END
BEGIN NOW So, I'm just gonna cover all of it. END

BEGIN NOW We're gonna put our chicken stock in on the sides, and then finally, we're gonna finish it off with our rub. END
BEGIN NOW Nice, big, fat coating up on top. END
BEGIN NOW You should really think about opening up a Cajun joint. [chuckles] We're gonna cover it with plastic and then foil make sure we got a rely tight seal on that. END
BEGIN NOW Cook it for 8½½ to 12 hours around 230 to 250. END
BEGIN NOW What's up next? Creole slaw. END
BEGIN NOW We got cabbage. END
BEGIN NOW Shredded carrots, some shredded white onions. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna finish that off with some sliced green onions. END
BEGIN NOW Lightly toss. END
BEGIN NOW Our wet ingredients are Blue Plate may END

BEGIN NOW We're just gonna blend it with our stick blender. END
BEGIN NOW Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Leave it a little bit chunky. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause it's funky when it's chunky. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna put a little bit of turbinado sugar. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're gonna add the baking soda, which helps alkaline the tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW And it brings out all flavors. END
BEGIN NOW It's like night and day. END
BEGIN NOW So how long are we gonna let this simmer? END
BEGIN NOW Just for 20 minutes, and then it's good. END
BEGIN NOW This is done, sits there and simmers. END
BEGIN NOW Now we make the sandwich, put it all together. END

BEGIN NOW Rustic, sweet, a little bit of spice. END
BEGIN NOW That basil oil's the bomb. END
BEGIN NOW I got to try this sandwich by itself. END
BEGIN NOW What'd you think about that? END
BEGIN NOW You know what? I'll tell you something if you're left with just mac pimento by itself END
BEGIN NOW it's really not enough texture. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Texture was the word. END
BEGIN NOW But you put the pasta in there and the tomato a little bit of spice coming out of that, as well. END
BEGIN NOW This is where it goes on. END
BEGIN NOW Uh-huh. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW That's how you do it. This is so good. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna go into, like, a little dream sequence. END
BEGIN NOW I am telling you what this just takes me back to childhood. END
BEGIN NOW It's a labor of love, so we better produce, right? END
BEGIN NOW They call it The Grilled Cheeserie. [chuckles] We're the place where grilled cheeses are made. END
BEGIN NOW We're the place where dreams about grilled cheeses are fulfilled. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] I got a pimento mac going out with the soup. END
BEGIN NOW You can never go wrong with that combination. END
BEGIN NOW So you've only been in Nashville for a month? END
BEGIN NOW And I've already eaten here an embarrassing amount of times. END
BEGIN NOW Seriously? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Here, everybody's got to wait in line. END
BEGIN NOW mm This joint's even catering to country star royalty. END
BEGIN NOW I come to Nashville, I expect to see, you know, some superstars, but Trace Adkins at a grilled cheeserie. END
BEGIN NOW This is gourmet right here, man. END
BEGIN NOW House-made pimento cheese, local cheddar, macaroni that's this sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW He reads the menu of a food truck and makes it sound like a country song. END

BEGIN NOW Trace, good luck on tour, brother. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, Guy. Appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. Nashville what a town. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, Trace I should have given him a ride or something. END
BEGIN NOW Tis squeal Not again. END
BEGIN NOW Coming up. Hit it, Danny. END
BEGIN NOW we're staying in Nashville, but headed to the house that grandma built. END
BEGIN NOW I can do that! So I'm about two miles west of downtown Nashville on Murphy Road to check out a joint where a chef, who's a transplant from New York City he's had a couple places. END
BEGIN NOW You've probably heard of them The Dancing Bear, The Red Rooster, and for the last 15 years, he's been rocking this place. END
BEGIN NOW This is Caffé Nonna. END
BEGIN NOW Pickup, table five. END
BEGIN NOW I start craving it through the week. END
BEGIN NOW It's like I'm in Italy. Really? END
BEGIN NOW Whether you're eating meatball arrabiata END
BEGIN NOW The balance of the flavors is just wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW or the seafood Angelina END
BEGIN NOW The best Italian dish I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW The home-style preparation feels like you're sitting at grandma's house. END
BEGIN NOW So it's fitting chef Danny Maggipinto named the joint for the woman who first got him into cooking. END
BEGIN NOW My interest came from watching my grandmother cook. END
BEGIN NOW But, you know, she never had any recipes, so I used to try to watch her. END
BEGIN NOW And when I asked her what she put in it, she said, A little bit of this, little bit of that, a little bit of this. So while studying at culinary school helped him learn the science, his nonna's at the heart of every dish END
BEGIN NOW like his take on her Italian classic. END
BEGIN NOW We've got the lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW Piled eight layers high. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it, Danny. END
BEGIN NOW We've got the filling for the lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW So what we have here is some whole-milk ricotta cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Add the cream to it. END
BEGIN NOW Shallots, garlic, sage, dried oregano, dried basil, crushed red pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Salt and pepper. Then we whip it. END
BEGIN NOW  Whip it good. See? END
BEGIN NOW All right, so what we're gonna do first when we layer these all together, we're going to add some marinara sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Next lasagna sheets. END
BEGIN NOW A nice, fresh lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW And then we add some of the ricotta mix. END
BEGIN NOW Add some spinach. END
BEGIN NOW Put another layer down. END
BEGIN NOW And we put them in the middle, goes the butternut squash. END
BEGIN NOW Rustic, baby Some more layers of lasagna going down. END
BEGIN NOW Then again, we put some more of the ricotta down. END

BEGIN NOW Then we put some more of the spinach. END
BEGIN NOW What, the entire garden? Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Another layer. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. All right, we put that on. END
BEGIN NOW And then, to finish it off, we top it with marinara sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome. I mean, I've made a lot of lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW I've never seen it look this rustic. END
BEGIN NOW We feel really good. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it with some parmesan cheese here. END
BEGIN NOW We got some shredded mozzarella right here. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. This goes in the oven how long? END
BEGIN NOW 400 degrees for about an hour, hour and a half. END
BEGIN NOW Covered. Covered. END
BEGIN NOW So here's our cooked-off lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW Now it's ready to portion. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Now we put it in the pan. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it with a little bit of marinara sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it with some reggianito parmigiano, some mozzarella and then we put it in the oven for 10 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so this is the finished product. END
BEGIN NOW And what we do is we put down the the mornay sauce has a little bit of parmesan in it. END
BEGIN NOW Take a little bit of Swiss chard that's been steamed. END
BEGIN NOW Then we take the lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of marinara sauce like that. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it with some parmesan cheese, a little bit of fresh basil. END
BEGIN NOW And then these are some fried julienne carrots, julienne zucchini, and julienne squash. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing wrong with that. END
BEGIN NOW And that's all she wrote. And that's all she wrote. END
BEGIN NOW That's lasagna nonna. END
BEGIN NOW And this is the kind of lasagna that your grandmother would make when you we This is sort of my version. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to put a little spin on it. END
BEGIN NOW You know what I like, is look at the amount of spinach this puts on his lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW Nice, big, thick noodles in there. END
BEGIN NOW You definitely don't hold back on the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Three different sauces in there. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you put a lot of time and work into it. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. It tastes like it. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job, chef. Thank you. END

BEGIN NOW Tiny, little place right here on a fast road going into Duluth. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think people expect when they pull in they're gonna find food with such broad profile of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW You're awesome. END
BEGIN NOW Got to come see this girl. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's it for this road trip, but don't worry. END
BEGIN NOW We got plenty more joints to find all over the country! END

BEGIN NOW Wait a second. Wait a second. END
BEGIN NOW This is where I’ve been eating. Ah, come on. END

BEGIN NOW Plus, I finally get my hands on truffles that couldn't be any fresher. END
BEGIN NOW Pulling it right out of the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man. END
BEGIN NOW From scenic hilltops END
BEGIN NOW This is worth the plane ticket to Italy by itself. END
BEGIN NOW to picture-perfect villages. Unforgettable. END
BEGIN NOW it's buon appetito all the way. END
BEGIN NOW w. o. w! END
BEGIN NOW Aa So, I'm here in the town of Collodi, partway between Florence and Pisa. END
BEGIN NOW This is the birthplace of Pinocchio, but it's also the birthplace of the idea of having a Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives tour through Italy. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, the food here's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW The owner He is one of a kind. END
BEGIN NOW And the experience unforgettable. END
BEGIN NOW This is Mangiafuoco. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian The food is very good. END
BEGIN NOW It's more authentic. I think it's authentic. END
BEGIN NOW That's what hooked me two years ago when I was traveling through Italy. END
BEGIN NOW Matt Nagan and I shot the Schellville Grill in Sonoma, California. END
BEGIN NOW He introduces me to these two. END
BEGIN NOW They say one night, Let’s go to dinner. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna take you to this place called Mangiafuoco. And out comes out the man. END
BEGIN NOW That would be crazy man Massimo Iacopini, who opened this joint with his wife, Sonia Pascucci, in '05. END
BEGIN NOW Massimo is a character. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian I like people. I like my life. END
BEGIN NOW The food in Mangiafuoco How do you describe it? END
BEGIN NOW Natural food. END
BEGIN NOW Natural food. Country food. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Country food. END
BEGIN NOW Everything is fresh, and this is important. END
BEGIN NOW Spaghetti Mangiafuoco. END
BEGIN NOW The spaghetti with the capers and fresh cherry tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW It's fantastic. I love it. END
BEGIN NOW You can taste everything of Italy in one dish. END
BEGIN NOW The Spaghetti Mangiafuoco. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW Olio d'oliva. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, extra virgin olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW Aglio. Okay, the garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Cappero. END
BEGIN NOW Capers. END
BEGIN NOW Acciuga. Anchovy. END
BEGIN NOW Your recipe? END
BEGIN NOW Chef is Sonia. I test. END
BEGIN NOW This is the test kitchen? END
BEGIN NOW Both [laughing] Beautiful tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, that's one of the things. END
BEGIN NOW Getting tomatoes in Italy is just a totally different thing. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian Peperoncino. Peperoncino. END
BEGIN NOW Spaghetti. END
BEGIN NOW We'll finish the pasta in the sauce? END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW It's very al dente. END
BEGIN NOW It's light. END
BEGIN NOW It's got a little bit of spice to it. END
BEGIN NOW The tomatoes bring it out. END
BEGIN NOW I really think the kicker for the whole thing END
BEGIN NOW is the little bit of anchovy? END
BEGIN NOW Very simple, but END
BEGIN NOW Very wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW Like you. END
BEGIN NOW Laugh The pasta's really good. It was really spicy. END
BEGIN NOW grown with one claw, or because I think it's legend has it END
BEGIN NOW Lo at the roots on that hair! END
BEGIN NOW The legend of the one-clawed lobster. END
BEGIN NOW Someone missed their appointment. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Decent-size pieces Yeah, right there behind you. END
BEGIN NOW We mix it up. Little shake? END
BEGIN NOW with celery and celery salt END
BEGIN NOW That enough? END
BEGIN NOW but there's a secret to the perfect lobster roll that I finally got Jay to spill. END
BEGIN NOW How much mayonnaise do we use? END
BEGIN NOW As little as you can. END
BEGIN NOW Just to cover the lobster a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW You don't want to put too much mayonnaise. END
BEGIN NOW  -That's it? -That's it. END
BEGIN NOW You can actually taste the lobster. END
BEGIN NOW Right off the boat. Fresh as can be. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Jay only does the lobster roll on occasion when he can get the fire sale on one-claws. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause he insists keeping prices down is a big part of beia real neighborhood diner. END
BEGIN NOW As a broke college student, I enjoy it very much. END
BEGIN NOW And this really is the neighborhood place. END
BEGIN NOW e cops always know where the od food is. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, definitely. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't eat anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW Only Kelly's for breakfast. and lunch. END
BEGIN NOW Nope, not dinner. They close at 3:00. END
BEGIN NOW yes, how we doing? I got a decaf. END
BEGIN NOW Till then, this place is full of regulars who come in so often, the waitresses actually know what they want. END
BEGIN NOW You want a coffee. You want a tea. onions. They already know. END
BEGIN NOW Who would want a coffee or a tea and have no onions in either one? END
BEGIN NOW One part speed END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW You want some here coffee? END
BEGIN NOW one part attitude. END
BEGIN NOW Give him some more coffee. You got it in your hand. END
BEGIN NOW That was probably my first Triple D girl. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man. We had the best time. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, I trying to help. END
BEGIN NOW And, unfortunately, we lost her a few years ago. END
BEGIN NOW But I will tell ya, every time this show would come back up, well, she'd make me smile. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a lost way of life. END
BEGIN NOW Everything a diner was supposed to be years ago a place to hang, to eat a great meal, and to make some friends. END
BEGIN NOW I appreciate you letting me train under your tutelage. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, honey, if I trained you whoa! END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] Next, we're heading to New Jersey, 'cause I want to see what happens when a fireman with no diner experience decides to restore a classic. END
BEGIN NOW So when I do something, I try to do it to perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and your boysenberry apple scones smell about done. END
BEGIN NOW Ahh, you're good. END
BEGIN NOW I like to bake. END
BEGIN NOW When it comes to classic American road food, no place does it bigger than New Jersey. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, they got more diners than any other state. END
BEGIN NOW But come check this out with me, and you'll see why you don't have to be big to be big. END
BEGIN NOW This is the beginning of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. When I got a call from the producers of the show and they said, Hey, meet us in Linden, New Jersey. END
BEGIN NOW We're sending you a plane ticket, I flew on the red-eye, showed up, rolled out of the cab. END
BEGIN NOW The camera and the audio walk up and say, Hey, are you with the talent for this new show? And I said, With the talent? I am the talent. They rolled their eyes and walked away. END
BEGIN NOW That's how the whole show started. END
BEGIN NOW What do you need, buddy? END
BEGIN NOW I need food. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] The diner sits just across the street from one of the country's biggest refineries and a few miles from the port of Newark. END
BEGIN NOW You want to know who was not real happy about having the camera jammed in their face? END
BEGIN NOW All the dudes from the oil refinery that come over to the Bayway to get a quick burger and get back to work. END
BEGIN NOW The whole family's here the father and the two sons. END
BEGIN NOW Look at them. END
BEGIN NOW The Torres family, all truck drivers, wouldn't even think of hitting the road without fueling up here. END
BEGIN NOW For Louis, that means a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich about five mornings a week. END
BEGIN NOW What makes it so good? END
BEGIN NOW I think it's the love that my friend puts in the food here. END
BEGIN NOW The love. You can taste the love? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. When you come in here, it tastes like food straight from home. END
BEGIN NOW Your mom cooked this way? END
BEGIN NOW He cooks better than my mom. END
BEGIN NOW Breakfast here is really killer. END
BEGIN NOW Killer? Was that the first killer? END
BEGIN NOW The big hitter is something called the Bayway special. END
BEGIN NOW You start with a couple of eggs, add some bacon, then fry up a couple of pieces NN Taylor ham some places call that pork roll add some cheese, stack it all up, and slap it on a breakfast roll. END
BEGIN NOW That's the big seller. END
BEGIN NOW They named the refinery after it. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW And if that's not enough to kick-start your day, some folks make another choice. END
BEGIN NOW What are these hot cauldrons? END
BEGIN NOW That's the soup. END
BEGIN NOW Now, if you want to see something really interesting, take a look right there. END
BEGIN NOW Look at my left arm. END
BEGIN NOW No tattoos. END
BEGIN NOW Homemade soup for the day. END
BEGIN NOW We eat soup at breakfast in Jersey? END
BEGIN NOW Sure, we do. We warm it up. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of people come in here 'cause they're working the night shift at the refinery. END
BEGIN NOW So they'll come in and eat, like, dinner-type items? END
BEGIN NOW They'll even add cheese and bacon if you want. END
BEGIN NOW Everything on it I like. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Except for the tomato. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I don't eat any health food here These guys say everything here is fresher and tastier than standard fast food. END
BEGIN NOW I'm supposed to stand there and ask questions like I'm on 20/20, but I don't. END
BEGIN NOW I'm in the middle of the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Pele are walking by, so I start to help. END
BEGIN NOW The producer says, What was that you were doing in there? I said, I got to be involved. I got to cook a little. END
BEGIN NOW I got to work with them. And he drops his clipboard and yells, We got hit. All right. Are the cameras rolling? END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] What makes this totally off the hook is END
BEGIN NOW Stop. That's got to be the first off the hook ever in the history of Triple D. Take a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Mike had zero experience in the food biz. END
BEGIN NOW Scrambled egg on white toast, please. END
BEGIN NOW He's actually a Newark firefighter and co-owner with his cousin of a garbage-hauling company. END
BEGIN NOW A year ago, looking for a garage for their garbage trucks, they stumbled into the diner biz. END
BEGIN NOW I walked in here. END
BEGIN NOW We figured, Hey, let's knock this place down. END
BEGIN NOW It's old, dirty, grungy. END
BEGIN NOW Let's knock it down, put up a garage And after 50 years, the place was a mess, but it was kind of a local landmark. END
BEGIN NOW Some folks even tried to talk Mike into keeping it open. END
BEGIN NOW And suddenly, this Jersey kid who'd gone to diners all his life thought, Hey, why not? And you shut it down because it needed to be totally Totally remodeled. END
BEGIN NOW How long did it take you to refurbish it? END
BEGIN NOW Two, two and a half months. END
BEGIN NOW To get from this to this. END
BEGIN NOW Well, we're in New Jersey. END
BEGIN NOW It's got to scream, Diner. Man, is it screaming. END
BEGIN NOW Now, this was the original door, right? END
BEGIN NOW Is there anything else we saved? END
BEGIN NOW Not really. END
BEGIN NOW GIUNTA It's my passion. END
BEGIN NOW When I do something, I try to do it to perfect. END
BEGIN NOW So that had to include the food. END
BEGIN NOW This is gourmet over here. END
BEGIN NOW Listen, I only pick the best. END
BEGIN NOW Now, how did you re him? END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Ad in the paper. END
BEGIN NOW Ad in the paper? END
BEGIN NOW Out of 42 chefs. END
BEGIN NOW Joe Gonzalez had been cooking at a place that had just been sold. END
BEGIN NOW The timing was perfect. END
BEGIN NOW And soon, Joe was turning out stuff I'd never expect to find in a nine-seat joint across from the refinery. END
BEGIN NOW Like Cajun grilled chicken, marinated overnight and served over tri-colored pasta, and two versions of a Philly cheesesteak for $5. 95 totally loaded one with chicken, one with beef. END
BEGIN NOW But not the pre-packaged, pre-sliced beef lots of places use. END
BEGIN NOW This is top-round, seasoned and oven-baked. END
BEGIN NOW But where does he do that? END
BEGIN NOW Joe? -Yes, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Down here in the submarine, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Geez. END
BEGIN NOW Turns out, there's a hidden kitchen in the basement. END
BEGIN NOW IIIs there a height requirement in here? END
BEGIN NOW That's where Joe really makes the magic END
BEGIN NOW The hot garlic. END
BEGIN NOW marinating the chicken, making the soup END
BEGIN NOW Do you see the light right between Joe and I? END
BEGIN NOW That's literally, like, a clamp-on light with, like, a household light bulb. END
BEGIN NOW No real high-tech lighting like we have now on Triple D. We cooked this all this morning. END
BEGIN NOW And especially the top round for the Philly cheesesteak. END
BEGIN NOW It's got to be cold to slice it. END
BEGIN NOW 20 or 25 pounds at a time. END
BEGIN NOW It's an overnight process. END
BEGIN NOW You rub it with the base. END
BEGIN NOW Joe marinates the beef, believe it or not, in chicken base, beef base, salt, and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Then he oven-roasts it with celery, onions, and carrots for two and a half hours and lets it cool END
BEGIN NOW As thin as you can. END
BEGIN NOW before he slices it. END
BEGIN NOW He's hand-on with everything. END
BEGIN NOW  Who bone, rolled, and tied this? END
BEGIN NOW I did it myself. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, but you can buy it done that way. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you do it yourself? -We like to do it fresh. END
BEGIN NOW And it shows. END
BEGIN NOW From top-round cheesesteaks END
BEGIN NOW Hey, what's up, my man? END
BEGIN NOW to making every customer feel welcome, the Bayway's what a diner was born to be. END
BEGIN NOW And I'd rather be here than one of them big, king of commercial-type things. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Mike's still a little stunned to be running the kind of place he always wanted to hang out in and succeeding. END
BEGIN NOW He says he'll always keep the working guys well-fed and happy. END
BEGIN NOW They have his coffee ready for him. Look. END
BEGIN NOW But he's expanded his hours to include the dinner crowd. END
BEGIN NOW And everyone's welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Just park behind the backhoe and come on in. END
BEGIN NOW Get over here, man. END
BEGIN NOW Next, we're headed south to a place where they pack them in by the hundreds, make meals in seconds, where they've been doing it the old-fashioned way for 60 years. END
BEGIN NOW I'm coming. I'm coming. END
BEGIN NOW mm For 60 years, folks around Spartanburg, South Carolina, have been in love with a local landmark called the Beacon Drive-In. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the Camaro? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, the Camaro didn't start until the first season. END
BEGIN NOW Nope, this we borrowed a car in each town we went to. END
BEGIN NOW I've never seen anything like it. END
BEGIN NOW Anybody got that ham? END
BEGIN NOW This place is loud. END
BEGIN NOW The fact that the great people of the Beacon Drive-In let me come and shoot this show is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW This is how they are every day all the time this busy. END
BEGIN NOW It may look like pandemonium, END
BEGIN NOW but I'm telling ya, these guys have a playbook Wrap it twice, so if it comes loose, we won't lose it, all right? END
BEGIN NOW They've got a system for cranking it all out END
BEGIN NOW fresh and hot in seconds. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW They'll serve 15,000 to 20,000 customers a week at a town of only 45,000 people, 2,000 meals a day. END
BEGIN NOW Mouth full It tastes delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Look at me just wandering around in the background here. END
BEGIN NOW Hello. A mountain of French fries and homemade onion rings, a combination they call a-plenty. Chili cheese a-plenty. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not kidding you. The a-plenty is the bomb. END
BEGIN NOW That's their best seller, a cheeseburger topped with homemade chili somewhere under all of this. END
BEGIN NOW It comes as a double, too, or with bacon. END
BEGIN NOW Or a barbecue a-plenty. END
BEGIN NOW I know how you guys feel when you say, I watch your show, and I get hungry. I'm watching the show. I'm getting hungry. END
BEGIN NOW Today we've got 1,000 pounds of onions we've prepared just for today. END
BEGIN NOW 1,000 pounds of onions for one day? END
BEGIN NOW One day. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow, another 1,000. END
BEGIN NOW Just so you know, they have an onion-cutting room. END
BEGIN NOW Sighs It was rough. END
BEGIN NOW Standing by the room was tough. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh-sliced each morning END
BEGIN NOW You use your stomach right there. END
BEGIN NOW they're deep-fried nonstop. END
BEGIN NOW Toss high 'cause it splatters, okay? END
BEGIN NOW I like this part. END
BEGIN NOW But the real adventure is how they collect all the scalding-hot rings when they're done in the fryer. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I know why you guys are [laughing]. END
BEGIN NOW Do you guys know about tongs? END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] I just think that's funny. END
BEGIN NOW Original owner John White Sr. opened up in 1946 a few blocks away, moved here 10 years later, and worked the counter himself for more than half a century, turning the Beacon into a local landmark folks keep coming back to END
BEGIN NOW Everybody knows the Beacon. END
BEGIN NOW generation after generation. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, in my teens with my boyfriend. END
BEGIN NOW Our parents and grandparents brought us here. END
BEGIN NOW Grown up on it. [laughs] How old were you the first time you came in here? END
BEGIN NOW Probably about 6 months. END
BEGIN NOW And there's now a younger generation running the Beacon. END
BEGIN NOW When Mr. White finally decided to retire after more than 50 years END
BEGIN NOW Those are hot. END
BEGIN NOW Kenny, Mark, Steve, and five other local businessmen got together to buy the place, determined to keep it what it's always been, and out of the hands of us Californians. END
BEGIN NOW Then there was another company from California that was interested in buying it, and one of the reasons that we ended up getting it was that they knew they we would keep it and run it the way 'Cause you know those California guys would get in here. END
BEGIN NOW They'd be serving sushi, next thing you know. END
BEGIN NOW And not just the a-plenties, but a huge menu of scratch-cooked Beacon ecials. END
BEGIN NOW It is a secret, that's for sure. END
BEGIN NOW From a homemade chicken stew END
BEGIN NOW Chives or green onions? END
BEGIN NOW Mae. END
BEGIN NOW to all kinds of barbecue, pulled and sliced, pork and beef, a slow-cooked and chopped beef shoulder they call Beacon hash. END
BEGIN NOW Catfish and perch, a special pimiento cheese spread that makes a bomb grilled-cheese sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW Might be the first time you heard bomb on Triple D. So this is kind of like a South Carolina panini. END
BEGIN NOW Even a full breakfast whatever you want. END
BEGIN NOW Biscuits and gravy, grits, and look at this. END
BEGIN NOW Take a look to the right. What do you see on that shirt? END
BEGIN NOW Mm, might just be a little shameless plug for a little Tex Wasabi in Santa Rosa, California. END
BEGIN NOW They've even got a secret recipe for iced tea southern style, full of lemon and sugar. END
BEGIN NOW I'm coming up. END
BEGIN NOW This is in the beginning of me doing stupid stuff on the show, AA like climbing up on the slippery stainless-steel table when I'm scared of heights. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome. END
BEGIN NOW How many stirs? -I do about 10. END
BEGIN NOW That's right. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, Spartanburg! Yeah! END
BEGIN NOW But as big and good as the menu is here END
BEGIN NOW What you gonna have, sir? END
BEGIN NOW folks say the heart of this place is one amazing p==son. END
BEGIN NOW When we say amazing person, we mean it. END
BEGIN NOW J. C. was the best. END
BEGIN NOW Ice a-plenty! END
BEGIN NOW That's a barbecue ham sandwich surrounded by French-fried potatoes and onion rings. END
BEGIN NOW I got a cheese bacon a-plenty on the line! END
BEGIN NOW J. C. Strobbles a Spartanburg institution. END
BEGIN NOW He's been calling orders here for half a century. END
BEGIN NOW He's lost his eyesight but not his enthusiasm or his energy. END
BEGIN NOW Just say, Hot dog a-plenty. Holler it out. END
BEGIN NOW Hot dog a-plenty! END
BEGIN NOW There you go. Very good. END
BEGIN NOW We lost J. C. a few years ago, and everybody misses him. END
BEGIN NOW Man, oh, man, here's only one person that could call it. END
BEGIN NOW A cheeseburger with a-plenty! END
BEGIN NOW After my third try, I was shot. END
BEGIN NOW I've only done five of them. END
BEGIN NOW All right, five. END
BEGIN NOW You've been doing this for how many years? END
BEGIN NOW In my spare time, I go to church and I go home and get my rest. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW But there's no rest for anyone while J. C. 's on point. END
BEGIN NOW Just so you know, that was the first time and the last time that I ever wore an apron on Triple D. Take it down and give it to the lady with the rolls. END
BEGIN NOW Hurry back. You got to hurry back. END
BEGIN NOW He's gonna call again. END
BEGIN NOW The orders never stop coming in. END
BEGIN NOW Must be something in the water down here, but these people can eat. END
BEGIN NOW It's just all in the food, and they give you lots of it. END
BEGIN NOW S that room right there that girl was sitting in? END
BEGIN NOW I sat in that room for clicks tongue two days. END
BEGIN NOW I must've read the same newspaper 10 times. END
BEGIN NOW You're not gonna find anything like the Beacon anyplace else not that I've ever seen. END
BEGIN NOW 60 years in, and they're still rocking and rolling. END
BEGIN NOW Great Good END
BEGIN NOW This is what we come for. END
BEGIN NOW a one-of-a-kind experience, and some very special people you really ought to meet. END
BEGIN NOW A cheeseburger with END
BEGIN NOW S what time it is? END
BEGIN NOW Bell dings 's 5:30. END
BEGIN NOW We'd been there since 7:00 in the morning and we didn't leave until 10:00. END
BEGIN NOW three days. END
BEGIN NOW Up next, we're heading out to the midwest, where, for a couple in their 20s, one diner simply ain't enough. END
BEGIN NOW When we got here, we just couldn’t pass it up. END
BEGIN NOW Camera won't fit, and it's too dark. END
BEGIN NOW the last thing you'd probably expect to find would be a 50- or 60-year-old diner. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, we're not in New Jersey, but to find two of them or three of them side by side by side? END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW When this came here, we hadn't seen a diner before. END
BEGIN NOW You know, unless you went out east. END
BEGIN NOW But even out east, no one had seen anything like this before END
BEGIN NOW How do you like your spice? END
BEGIN NOW Chili flake spice, Sriracha spice? END
BEGIN NOW Sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW You got to put it on. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I hope you're hungry. END
BEGIN NOW Just so you know, you're gonna burn your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Look at this. END
BEGIN NOW When would this ever happen? END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. [laughs] That's the shot of the year! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW In all seriousness. really good. END
BEGIN NOW Give me the breakdown. What makes it so good? END
BEGIN NOW What do you enjoy about it? END
BEGIN NOW It's got to smell good before you taste it. END
BEGIN NOW Sniffs 'Cause that's a taste bud, too. END
BEGIN NOW The first bite tells the whole story. END
BEGIN NOW It's all got to happen at once like an explosion of taste in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW The spices makes your tongue tingle and sing Hava Nagila. Muttering rhythmically And they do that all the time. END
BEGIN NOW That's a foreign song. END
BEGIN NOW I have it on one of your albums. END
BEGIN NOW You're just going right after it. END
BEGIN NOW That's good. That's really good. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Fried Royale. END
BEGIN NOW Bell dings It is just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Good portions, good price. END
BEGIN NOW Ready to go. END
BEGIN NOW It's almost like that home-cooked loving, feeling food, you know what I mean? END
BEGIN NOW I like these little places like Rutt's because you have somebody who cares about what he does. END
BEGIN NOW It's that down-home ideal. END
BEGIN NOW This is like mom's making your food. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't look le my mom, but this is like mom's making your food. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Gene's got to roll, but I'm sticking around for more of mom's Hawaiian home cooking. END
BEGIN NOW Laulau plate. Laulau dish? END
BEGIN NOW Laulau. We say it twice. END
BEGIN NOW Rutt's Hawaiian Café may be outside of L. A. in Culver City, but according to locals, it's just like being in Hawaii. END
BEGIN NOW When you walk into this place, you get the genuine feeling that you're probably on the islands. END
BEGIN NOW It just brings me back to my first time experiencing Hawaii. END
BEGIN NOW WAHBA: Laulau plate is ready. This is the Laulau dish. END
BEGIN NOW Very traditional Hawaiian dish. END
BEGIN NOW It has pork, usually add some butterfish in it incredible. END
BEGIN NOW A Laulau dish? END
BEGIN NOW Laulau. We say it twice. END
BEGIN NOW We start by trimming the butterfish. END
BEGIN NOW Black cod is also known as butterfish. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Remove the center part first the bigger bone. END
BEGIN NOW You don't want that in your food. END
BEGIN NOW Laulau always has fish with it? END
BEGIN NOW Butterfish adds to flavor. You need to have that. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise, it's not really authentic Hawaiian. END
BEGIN NOW So, there's your fish. We got pork butt. END
BEGIN NOW Now what do we do? Let's make our marinade. END
BEGIN NOW That's some water we poured in there. END
BEGIN NOW Little liquid smoke. END
BEGIN NOW Hawaiian sea salt. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna whisk it up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Now what we're gonna do is you want to mix it all in there. END
BEGIN NOW Make sure it all gets marinated properly. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna turn into Kahlua. END
BEGIN NOW When we marinate it, it's a Kahlua. END
BEGIN NOW It's two days to marinate. END
BEGIN NOW When we come back, we'll put it all together in the taro leaf. END
BEGIN NOW We'll make Laulau. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start by getting a taro leaf, and then we cut the stem. END
BEGIN NOW These are fresh leaves. These haven't been frozen? END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW This is pretty much what we need. END
BEGIN NOW You want to put the foil. END
BEGIN NOW Nonstick spray hissing Completely cover it. END
BEGIN NOW So, you put a lot of the taro. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna get the kahlua pork the marinated pork that we did. END
BEGIN NOW About this much. Drop it right in the center. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna get butterfish. END
BEGIN NOW It's gonna go in there with it? END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. You want to put on top. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna wrap it up tightly. END
BEGIN NOW Wrap it up with the foil. END
BEGIN NOW Nice and tight. END
BEGIN NOW This is ready to go. END
BEGIN NOW Steam it for four hours. Steam it for four hours. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see it. It's ready to go. END
BEGIN NOW Serve it with rice. What else goes with it? END
BEGIN NOW It's always two scoops of rice, one scoop mac. END
BEGIN NOW And that's it. END
BEGIN NOW That's your Laulau. END
BEGIN NOW Are you supposed to eat the taro leaf? END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW Look at how tender that pork is. END
BEGIN NOW The pork is about as ridiculously tender as you can imagine. END
BEGIN NOW It's not over seasoned. END
BEGIN NOW You added liquid smoke because typically, this is cooked in a pit, so you're getting a little bit of that smoke imparted into it. END
BEGIN NOW But it's not super smokey. END
BEGIN NOW It's not fishy, but it is definitely island. END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me of Hawaii. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job. Thank you very much. END
BEGIN NOW Laulau. END
BEGIN NOW This is about as good as any Laulau I've ever had. END
BEGIN NOW It's such an amazing taste. END
BEGIN NOW It's a little unique. It is. END
BEGIN NOW Once you get that appreciation for it, it's END
BEGIN NOW It's good. rock star. END
BEGIN NOW Here's your fried Hawaiian Royale. END
BEGIN NOW This is the closest thing to like the way my family cooks it. END

BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add our buttermilk, yogurt, and some whole eggs. END
BEGIN NOW It has to be incorporated for about a minute. END

BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna just add a little bit END
BEGIN NOW more flour. END
BEGIN NOW It's about 2 of these cups. It kind of varies. END
BEGIN NOW That's it. END
BEGIN NOW Mixture's out of the way. Now time to roll. END
BEGIN NOW Time to roll. Look at that. END

BEGIN NOW I'm going to just knead it. END
BEGIN NOW So what have we got going here? Are we gonna roll it again? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, we're just gonna get it kind of into a rectangle. END

BEGIN NOW Take off the skin. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause you can eat that stem. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW And then we Olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW King prawn. END
BEGIN NOW King prawns. One by one. END
BEGIN NOW And we leave the head on for the flavor, right? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Sea salt. END
BEGIN NOW And then honey chestnut. END
BEGIN NOW The what? END
BEGIN NOW Chestnut honey. Honi? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, honey! END
BEGIN NOW Both laugh And then brandy. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, of course you should. END
BEGIN NOW It's beautiful. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Then finish with just a cube of butter. END
BEGIN NOW Now we grab the artichokes. END
BEGIN NOW This dish has already started to take another level, just in the time and the energy that Chef is taking to put it together. END
BEGIN NOW Look at how beautiful this is. END
BEGIN NOW Warming up the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW And just finish. END
BEGIN NOW Tender, little sweet, little kiss of the brandy. END
BEGIN NOW Aa The sauce is nice and light. END
BEGIN NOW And the artichoke 's simple, it's what's in season. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job, Chef. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW The man, right here. END
BEGIN NOW Pick up the king prawn, please. END
BEGIN NOW It's very fresh and high-quality. END
BEGIN NOW The flavors all mix together. Very tasty. END
BEGIN NOW Worth the drive. Go up the hill. END
BEGIN NOW Find the joint. W. O. W. END
BEGIN NOW Wow is right. W. O. W. END
BEGIN NOW Both laugh Coming up END
BEGIN NOW we're headed south to San Miniato END
BEGIN NOW This is crazy. for a bucket-list adventure END
BEGIN NOW The whole experience is based off a 2-year-old dog? END
BEGIN NOW that's all about the truffles. Aha! I got it. END
BEGIN NOW So, here I am, taking a little break from Triple D, because I am in the land of rules. END
BEGIN NOW I'm about 50 miles west of Florence. END
BEGIN NOW So, here's the deal. END
BEGIN NOW Truffles form below the soil, near the tree roots. END
BEGIN NOW They're super expensive. They're like buried treasures. END
BEGIN NOW They're decadent, flavorful, and really rare. END
BEGIN NOW Plus, they're one of my favorite things in the world to cook with. END
BEGIN NOW So when I heard we could actually go truffle hunting here in Italy, forget about it, I'm going. END
BEGIN NOW I grabbed a couple of my American buddies, and we're hooking up with the experts. END
BEGIN NOW This is my buddy Fabio. Fabio, what's up, brother? END
BEGIN NOW Nice to see you. END
BEGIN NOW And this is the truffle man. Riccardo. END
BEGIN NOW The truffle guy. Riccardo. Nice to meet you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Are we gonna hunt with a pig, a dog? What do we want? END
BEGIN NOW FABIO: Turbo. We have Turbo. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian This is our truffle dog? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW How old is Turbo? END
BEGIN NOW 2 years old. END
BEGIN NOW 2 years old? END
BEGIN NOW The whole experience is based off a 2-year-old dog? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Turbo never fails. END
BEGIN NOW Turbo never fails? Never. END
BEGIN NOW This I want to see. END
BEGIN NOW We just follow the dog? END
BEGIN NOW We just follow Turbo, which is a special breed for hunting the truffle. END
BEGIN NOW And why are we using a dog and not a pig? END
BEGIN NOW I always heard about the pig. END
BEGIN NOW Because the pig eats the truffle. END
BEGIN NOW You can't pull the pig off? END
BEGIN NOW You can't pull the pig off from the truffle. END
BEGIN NOW All right. Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian When Turbo stops and starts to get his dig on, everybody just END
BEGIN NOW And, then, he doesn't find any. END
BEGIN NOW All right, come on, Turbo. END
BEGIN NOW Why this region are there more truffles? END
BEGIN NOW The soil, the climate is perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Perfect. END
BEGIN NOW There's no rhyme or reason why the truffle's there or not there. END
BEGIN NOW I me, that's why they can't cultivate truffles. END
BEGIN NOW That's why they're so expensive. END
BEGIN NOW That's probably why they're cherished so much, besides the fact that they taste awesome. END
BEGIN NOW But this is crazy. END
BEGIN NOW Just wondering around the field, looking for a tuber that grows on the root that's gonna be dug up by a dog. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] Turbo. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] Speaks Italian Speaks Italian He's on it? Uh-huh. END
BEGIN NOW Turbo. Turbo! END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Speaks Italian Oh, Turbo's going nuts. END
BEGIN NOW This is how I get about truffles. END
BEGIN NOW I just can't dig that hard. Oh, man. END
BEGIN NOW So that's it right there? END
BEGIN NOW The dirt smells like truffle. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian, [whistles] Okay. END
BEGIN NOW So, okay, just END
BEGIN NOW Whoa! END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW Pulling it right out of the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man. END
BEGIN NOW Good job. END
BEGIN NOW Turbo. Good job, Turbo. END
BEGIN NOW Once he got after it, we had to get after it. END
BEGIN NOW Thank goodness we got Turbo. END
BEGIN NOW Uh-huh. I got it. END
BEGIN NOW Listen, that was bucket-list stuff right there. END
BEGIN NOW But I got one more joint I got to check out before I leave Italy. END
BEGIN NOW It's north of here, in the city of Lucca END
BEGIN NOW My mouth is just firing up for this. END
BEGIN NOW where they're serving up traditional Tuscan dishes END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that is delicious. END
BEGIN NOW along with a little improvisation. END
BEGIN NOW The Italian judges give him a 9! END
BEGIN NOW So, here we are on a rainy day wrapping this Tuscany Trip even on a rainy day. END
BEGIN NOW But the one question that still remains is, where do I eat? END
BEGIN NOW From what I'm told, this is a jot you can't miss. END
BEGIN NOW This is Port Ellen Clan. END
BEGIN NOW Here we get the mackerel. END
BEGIN NOW It's Italian, light food. END
BEGIN NOW Traditional, but at the same time elegant. END
BEGIN NOW for gentleman that shows the passion and then the character of the owner. END
BEGIN NOW That would be Chef Leonardo Calo, who's been serving Tuscan food with a twist here END
BEGIN NOW Mussel carbonara. Since 2012. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you from? I was born in Pisa. END
BEGIN NOW There's something else going on in the accent you're not telling me. END
BEGIN NOW I tried to cook, first of all, in England. END
BEGIN NOW Leonardo is not afraid to be influenced by international food. END
BEGIN NOW The oxtail tortelli. END
BEGIN NOW It's a very peculiar interpretation of tortelli. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make one of our favorite dishes, the oxtail tortellis. END
BEGIN NOW First of all, the fresh-pressing olive oil, which is made three days ago. Let me try this. END
BEGIN NOW Shut the back door. END
BEGIN NOW We have carrots, celery, and onion. END
BEGIN NOW Sage and rosemary. END
BEGIN NOW I love both of them. END
BEGIN NOW Crush the garlic like that. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're gonna work on the oxtail. END
BEGIN NOW Some olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW The Italian judges give him a 9! END
BEGIN NOW Welsh salt. END
BEGIN NOW Welsh. Yes, you should put some on. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Now we add the oxtail to the vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW The red wine from Tuscany. Cover the oxtail with water. END
BEGIN NOW Just a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW And now we are working a very low temperature for three hours. So let it cool. END
BEGIN NOW Shred it off the bone. END
BEGIN NOW We have to go now with the bread. END
BEGIN NOW We get the oxtails. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna let the bread soak up all the jus. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make a party happen. Yeah, okay. END
BEGIN NOW Parmesan cheese. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're gonna add eggs. END
BEGIN NOW And then, we'll get some pasta sheets, and we start to do it. That is an egg wash. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW So, I like that you make the pasta by hand. END
BEGIN NOW Now I cut it and form it into tortelli. END
BEGIN NOW Next, they are gonna go in the water now. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Now is the reduction of the oxtail and the carrots together with a touch of butter and sherry vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Now we get the tortelli. END
BEGIN NOW Just let it get that a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. That's it. END
BEGIN NOW So, now we add the Vezzena cheese, the olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. END
BEGIN NOW That olive oil is in a different class all by itself. END
BEGIN NOW Do you mind if I try some? Oh, please, please, please. END
BEGIN NOW You know, my favorite part about the whole thing is that little kiss of that vinegar. END
BEGIN NOW The pasta has bite. Incredibly flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW The texture is nice and creamy. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, all of it is delicious. END
BEGIN NOW One of the best tortelli in Lucca. END
BEGIN NOW They are perfect with red wine. END
BEGIN NOW When you come to a city like this, you don't know what is local, what is tourist, and this is kind of off the beaten path. END
BEGIN NOW And when you come into your restaurant, it's like coming into somebody's home. END
BEGIN NOW I think that is what I was looking for. END
BEGIN NOW The quality of the ingredients is really very good, using the tradition of Lucca and some creative approach. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make next? The carbonara mussel. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of the bacon, which is a traditional recipe, we use the mussel. END
BEGIN NOW Should we drop the pasta? This is like short, fat rigatoni. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so now we take all the mussels that are cooked out of the shell, saving the liquid. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so, we work with the mussel and the water of the mussel. END
BEGIN NOW We remove the pasta from the boiling. END
BEGIN NOW We have generous Parmesan cheese on the top. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna make a nice, little sauce with the mussel water. END
BEGIN NOW And then we add only the yoke of the eggs. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna work it in. Great. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful dish. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add the Parmesan cheese. END
BEGIN NOW We add the pepper now with a touch of olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW My mouth is just firing up for this. END
BEGIN NOW Very impressive. END
BEGIN NOW You like your pasta al dente, my friend, and that is how I like mine. END
BEGIN NOW What I love, you've allowed mussels to take the place of pancetta. END
BEGIN NOW It's refined. END
BEGIN NOW It definitely has its respectable notes and accents and representations. END
BEGIN NOW I'm impressed, man. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you very much for having me. END
BEGIN NOW Really, I got to tell you, man, you're a good cat. END
BEGIN NOW Speaks Italian The mix of the eggs, cheese, and mussels They test very well. END
BEGIN NOW I watch you and I listen and things are very precise, but then you have a wild side. END
BEGIN NOW That is one of the best things they say to me in the last 20 years. END
BEGIN NOW So, you're blond, but you're not a nice girl, because if you was a nice girl, I would kiss you, okay? END
BEGIN NOW You're a good friend. END
BEGIN NOW I really like friends like you. END
BEGIN NOW Was that a great Triple D tour in Italy or what? END
BEGIN NOW I got to tell you, there's just one last thing. END
BEGIN NOW You know, you haven't been able to drive on top of the walls of Lucca since '85, but when you got a nice, red Ferrari like this, well, you just have to You know what I mean? END
BEGIN NOW I'll see you next time on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Hey, I'm Guy Fieri, and we're rolling out on a special edition of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives in Italy. END
BEGIN NOW This trip. Oh! END
BEGIN NOW we're filling up on the flavors of Florence. END

BEGIN NOW You're example. END
BEGIN NOW Then, a second-gen chef END
BEGIN NOW dishing out his own twist on tradition. END
BEGIN NOW I've never had a pasta like that. END
BEGIN NOW Plus, a fiery, fresh pizzeria END
BEGIN NOW Geez. You load that up. END
BEGIN NOW piling on a true Italian experience. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that's killer, man. END
BEGIN NOW From pasta to pollo END
BEGIN NOW The original chicken nugget. END
BEGIN NOW get ready for some of the best on the Boot. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, two forks? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you think that's what I need, huh? END
BEGIN NOW Horn honks So, when you think about the big cities in Italy, Mm what do you think of? END
BEGIN NOW Well, of course, you got Rome, you got Naples, you got Venice, and in the top five, right here in Florence. END
BEGIN NOW And they've got it all the museums, the Duomo, and, of course, restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW You got pizzerias, osterias, and old-school icon joints like this place, Fratelli Briganti. END
BEGIN NOW This is not tourist restaurant, but is Italian restaurant for Italian people. END
BEGIN NOW Everything they do is fresh. END
BEGIN NOW Pronto. END
BEGIN NOW The food is very good. It's homemade every day. END
BEGIN NOW By this guy, chef and owner Lido Briganti. END
BEGIN NOW His dad opened the place in 1960, raising his four sons in the biz. END
BEGIN NOW And, today, Lido's daughter, Ema, follows the family tradition. END
BEGIN NOW It's a cool name Fratelli Briganti. Brothers of Briganti? Yeah. Yeah. END

BEGIN NOW All right. So, what are we gonna make? END
BEGIN NOW It's spaghettini de Briganti. END
BEGIN NOW The spaghetti of the house. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna remove the skin from the tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW Where did you learn to cook, Chef? END
BEGIN NOW Speaking Italian Speaking Italian [laughs] He stole the job, looking his brothers and his father, and then END
BEGIN NOW So he watched his brothers and his father, so he stole the job from them. END
BEGIN NOW I love this guy. END
BEGIN NOW Now we put them in the colander. END
BEGIN NOW So, let the water drain out a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of salt. Olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW And that's the whole foundation of this? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking Italian He's the boss. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Hand slaps Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Now, the pasta that has a little bit of texture to the outside of it It's not thin and sheeny. END
BEGIN NOW And that's the difference, I think, in really great pasta. END

BEGIN NOW Ah, very crazy. Oh! Hey, ho! END
BEGIN NOW Coming up, a Korean-German combo in Los Angeles END
BEGIN NOW Spot-on, brother. END
BEGIN NOW Where beer makes the bird END
BEGIN NOW Holy cooked up glazed bird! END
BEGIN NOW And there's a lot more than beef in their burgers. END
BEGIN NOW I could eat one of those every day. END
BEGIN NOW So I'm here on the edge of Koreatown in Los Angeles, right down the street from Beer Belly, remember that place? The duck? Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow, I'm here to check out this Korean restaurant where they've got the traditional environment and the traditional menu Needle scratches on record Not so much. END
BEGIN NOW No, this is Biergarten fusion grill and craft beer. END
BEGIN NOW German fried rice! END
BEGIN NOW I've never seen Korean-German combination before. END
BEGIN NOW It's food that, literally, you can't get anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW Korean fried chicken with French toast. END
BEGIN NOW Koreatown obviously has a lot of different fusion places. END
BEGIN NOW Not German and Korean. END
BEGIN NOW But that didn't stop owner Neil Kwon from playing matchmaker. END
BEGIN NOW kimchi short rib fried rice. END
BEGIN NOW What gave you the inspiration to do a Korean fusion funky craft beer joint? END
BEGIN NOW after college, we backpacked through Europe. END
BEGIN NOW One of the stops, Germany. END
BEGIN NOW If anything, I wanted to capture that vibe. END
BEGIN NOW With the help of Chef Eddie Hah, who started mixing things up in the kitchen in 2011. END
BEGIN NOW HAH: One tempura fries. END
BEGIN NOW He's extremely passionate about everything he's serving here. END
BEGIN NOW Drunken chicken C3. END
BEGIN NOW It's called drunken chicken because they brine it in beer. END
BEGIN NOW It's very moist. Got a great crust on it. END
BEGIN NOW Just perfect. END
BEGIN NOW What are we making? The beer brine for the drunken chicken. END
BEGIN NOW Is that a typical Korean dish? No, it's not. END
BEGIN NOW I dig it. Let's get after it. All right. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna go ahead and put the Korean beer. END
BEGIN NOW Hai! Hai! Right. END
BEGIN NOW Water. We're gonna go ahead and put that honey in there. END
BEGIN NOW Some parsley. Half lemons. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of them. A lot of them. END
BEGIN NOW And garlic peeled. END
BEGIN NOW Add some bay leaf. END
BEGIN NOW Bay leaf, a Korean food? No. END
BEGIN NOW Just checking. END
BEGIN NOW Dry oregano, some kosher salt, and some black pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Fire it up and then END
BEGIN NOW then we'll brine. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Give that a little stir. END
BEGIN NOW Harry Potter called, he wants his spoon. END
BEGIN NOW Basically, we just want the salt to dissolve. END
BEGIN NOW Salt dissolves, bring the flavors together, and that's our brine that we're gonna use for our chicken. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW So we have our brine here now, it's at room temp. END
BEGIN NOW It smells a little like a sweet tea. END
BEGIN NOW You want to smell that? No, I'll smell it, and then you'll probably push my head in there. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] We are gonna go ahead and add the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW Down into the party bowl. END
BEGIN NOW And how long are we gonna hold the chicken? END
BEGIN NOW About 24 hours. END
BEGIN NOW So now that these have brined, we're gonna add the beer to the stems. END
BEGIN NOW And what kind of beer is this? END
BEGIN NOW This is a Guinness, actually. END
BEGIN NOW This is a dark stout, okay. END
BEGIN NOW And then I'm just gonna go ahead and pat this dry, I'll go ahead and season with salt, pepper, and some oil. END
BEGIN NOW Push the chicken down, right into the cavity, and into the oven at about 400 degrees for about 35 minutes. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW Holy cooked up glazed bird! END
BEGIN NOW That's impressive! END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna cut right down the center, and we'll go ahead and plate that with our cabbage frisee salad and garnish it with a pickled jalapeno and pickled diakon. END
BEGIN NOW All right, and that's it? That's it. END
BEGIN NOW We like to do beer can chicken, but I don't think I've ever had one that's infused and has this much flavor of beer. END
BEGIN NOW You get some of that nice roasted flavor from the skin, then you get a little bite of that slaw END
BEGIN NOW A little bite of that jalapeno. END
BEGIN NOW Chef, nicely done. Thank you, Chef. END
BEGIN NOW The skin's crispy, the meat's juicy. END
BEGIN NOW I get it every time I come here. END
BEGIN NOW These are three of my buddies from Guy's Grocery Games, Eric, Gabe, and Francesco. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think of the chicken? END
BEGIN NOW It's so flavorful. Like, I didn't think it would be this flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW The beer, the honey it's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW It's silly how juicy it is. END
BEGIN NOW It's silly how juicy it is? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW How do you describe the menu to people? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man, just anything and everything that pairs well with beer. END
BEGIN NOW That would be 25 types of craft beer, tapped alongside everything from kimchi pancakes to German sausage END
BEGIN NOW One wurstplatte, END
BEGIN NOW And a unique take on the burger. END
BEGIN NOW The meat is completely unique to any other burger in Los Angeles. END
BEGIN NOW All right, what are we making next? END
BEGIN NOW The Chosun burger. END
BEGIN NOW Chosun actually means Korea in Korean. END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't you just say Korea? END
BEGIN NOW I wanted it to sound like it's the chosen burger. END
BEGIN NOW Is that what you were going for? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, that's what I was going for. Gangster. END
BEGIN NOW I'm making some kimchi. All right. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna halve the napa cabbage. END
BEGIN NOW Salt? Four cups of salt. END
BEGIN NOW So this is like quick kimchi? It's somewhat quick. END
BEGIN NOW The cabbage will now sit at room temp for 24 hours. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna bring it back, rinse it, and then hit it with the paste. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. kimchi paste. END
BEGIN NOW We'll start with a little bit of water and then onion. END
BEGIN NOW Red pepper flakes, fish sauce, sugar, garlic whole garlic. Lots of it. END
BEGIN NOW Lots of it. And ginger. END
BEGIN NOW Baby shrimp. Pulse this. END
BEGIN NOW Add the Korean pear. Pear? END
BEGIN NOW You want to try that? END
BEGIN NOW That's good. Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW More like apple. Add the Korean radish next. END
BEGIN NOW So blend this up. END
BEGIN NOW Now we take that, and we're gonna brush it onto each leaf. END
BEGIN NOW Each leaf. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna let it sit out for 24 hours, and then throw it into the wok. END
BEGIN NOW So it gets funky, and then it's chili funky. END
BEGIN NOW Chili funky. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW All right, now we're into the Chosun One burger. END
BEGIN NOW We have a patty that we do 50/50 with beef and pork, and we add a little bit of tofu, which is a Korean thing, actually. END
BEGIN NOW So now it's 110% 110%. END
BEGIN NOW So that's it? And salt, pepper on the outside. END
BEGIN NOW Onto the grill. Fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add some grilled Spam, Korean bacon. END
BEGIN NOW Korean bacon! END
BEGIN NOW All right, we're gonna start off with a little bit of mustard on the bottom bun. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna add some of our sautéed kimchi. END
BEGIN NOW So you are allowed to cook kimchi after you've done it. END
BEGIN NOW It gets better when you sauté it. Really?! END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Man, it does. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW The hamburger patty. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of the pickled diakon. END
BEGIN NOW Red pepper aioli. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna go ahead and add the Spam. END
BEGIN NOW And some fries. END
BEGIN NOW What's the coating on the fry? END
BEGIN NOW It's a little tempura batter. END
BEGIN NOW If someone were to say, I'm gonna make you a hamburger, but I'm gonna Korean-ize it, that's what that is. END
BEGIN NOW Great texture, a lot of meat, acid, sweet, crunch, all there. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome burger. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW I could eat one of those every day. END
BEGIN NOW The patty is unique. END

BEGIN NOW I love coming back. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, there's so much history. END
BEGIN NOW So I'm in Charlotte. And you know what? END
BEGIN NOW To find a restaurant in a building that was built in the year 1900, that's pretty incredible. END
BEGIN NOW What's more incredible is that you got a mother and daughter team that are serving up an eclectic scratch-made menu. END
BEGIN NOW This is 300 East. END
BEGIN NOW French onion soup is in the window. END
BEGIN NOW 300 East is about the most welcoming place in town. END
BEGIN NOW The sweet potato ravioli. END
BEGIN NOW My favorite thing changes every week. END
BEGIN NOW Entrée crab cake up. END
BEGIN NOW Everything you eat is unique. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a classic American menu with some kind of surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Which is no surprise to the locals, 'cause owner Cathy Coulter opened doors in this house way back in 1986. END
BEGIN NOW The building is from the year 1900. END
BEGIN NOW Is that a big deal to folks? END
BEGIN NOW It is because so many of Charlotte's old buildings have been torn down. END
BEGIN NOW But Cathy prefers to build. END
BEGIN NOW So in 2000, she brought in daughter Ashley as general manager and pastry chef. END
BEGIN NOW Chocolate bread pudding. END
BEGIN NOW Guy Fieri And in 2001, Chef Kristine Schmidt came on to spearhead the savory side of things. END

BEGIN NOW For about four hours? Oh, four, four and a half. END
BEGIN NOW Shred it. END
BEGIN NOW We also strain out the braising liquid. END
BEGIN NOW Next step? All right. END
BEGIN NOW So we're gonna start the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW We reserve that lamb fat. I love it. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of fresh rosary. END
BEGIN NOW Bloom that rosemary, then hit the new cloth. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Onion, celery, carrots. END
BEGIN NOW Sweat it down. Sweat it down. END
BEGIN NOW Where were you on Saturday night?! END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Pun. END
BEGIN NOW Different kind of sweating it. END
BEGIN NOW Add in some more wine to glaze. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'm gonna go in with Some garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Crushed red pepper. I like this. END
BEGIN NOW And cinnamon. That is the kicker! END
BEGIN NOW Crushed tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW And then the braising liquid that we saved. END
BEGIN NOW that's nice. END
BEGIN NOW Tomato paste. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're just gonna add a little salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Then we'll drop the mushrooms in. Word. END
BEGIN NOW And then we go to our lamb. END
BEGIN NOW And get all that lamb in here. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that! Oh, man! END
BEGIN NOW Had Def Leppard just tried that, they would have called the song Pour Some Lamb Ragout On Me. The video would have been different. END
BEGIN NOW All right. Got our goat cheese ravioli down. END
BEGIN NOW Did someone locally mix those? Yes, they do. END
BEGIN NOW We provide the filling for them, and they stuff it for us. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, really? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Let's just get some of that right in on the center them raviolis. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Want to put a little bit of what we call goat butter. END
BEGIN NOW Nice fresh sprig of mint. END
BEGIN NOW Done. END
BEGIN NOW Mm Boy, the flavor's nice in there. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yeah. You definitely pick up the mushroom. END
BEGIN NOW I keep getting more and more depth of flavor every bite. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding. Oh, good. END
BEGIN NOW Glad you like it. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a professional. END
BEGIN NOW I've got a spotter now when I eat. END
BEGIN NOW Lamb and mushroom ragout. END

BEGIN NOW This is, like, the best thing I ever ate. END
BEGIN NOW Veggie black bean tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, the food's immense, but the vibe here is great. END
BEGIN NOW It welcomes you in, it feels good and homey. END
BEGIN NOW Walk across the tile floor, you see the old fireplace mantle here. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, it really has that warm feeling about it. END
BEGIN NOW And there's food you like. END
BEGIN NOW Especially if you're in the mood for dessert. END
BEGIN NOW The ice cream sandwich is well worth a visit to 300 East. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going from this to an ice cream sandwich? END
BEGIN NOW Yep, yep, yep. END

BEGIN NOW Welcome back. Hanging out in Charlotte, North Carolina, at 300 East with don't smile. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] There we go. I wanted to make sure. END
BEGIN NOW I was told I wasn't able to make her laugh. END
BEGIN NOW That's 'cause pastry chef Ashley Boyd takes her desserts seriously right down to old-fashioned desserts. END
BEGIN NOW Butterscotch ice cream sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW Other than my mom's house, I probably won't get any ==her homemade ice cream sandwiches. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so what are we making? END
BEGIN NOW First, we're gonna make the molasses cookies. END
BEGIN NOW So we couldn't just buy the cookie. No. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make the cookie. Of course. END
BEGIN NOW So let's get into this. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Unsalted butter, granulated sugar. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're gonna let it go for about three minutes. END
BEGIN NOW So we cream the sugar. END
BEGIN NOW This mimics a gluten-free flour mix that I make here. END
BEGIN NOW Get it going. We have baking soda, kosher salt, ground cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW Ginger? Ground ginger. END
BEGIN NOW Chia seed. END
BEGIN NOW Ch-ch-ch-chia! END
BEGIN NOW And some fresh nutmeg. END
BEGIN NOW Mix that together. END
BEGIN NOW Incorporate it evenly. Next step. END
BEGIN NOW Add the molasses. END
BEGIN NOW Next, we add the eggs? One at a time. END
BEGIN NOW Now we add in the dry mix. END
BEGIN NOW So we'll take this now? END
BEGIN NOW Now we scoop it into dough balls, put it in some sugar. END
BEGIN NOW We're just gonna roll them around. END
BEGIN NOW You're very precise. Very gentle, very END
BEGIN NOW Soft music plays That's very elegant. Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's those sausage fingers that say elegance. END
BEGIN NOW So these are gonna go for 18 minutes at what temp? 350. END
BEGIN NOW When are we gonna make the ice cream? Let's do it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna melt some unsalted butter and some brown sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy cream and whole milk. END
BEGIN NOW That's coming to a simmer. What's next? END
BEGIN NOW So then we take some egg yolks, brown sugar, and salt. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna temper this in? We are. END
BEGIN NOW So you pour in about 1/3 of the hot cream. END
BEGIN NOW So then this can just go back in. END
BEGIN NOW It needs to get up to 175, 180. END
BEGIN NOW I will strain it, put it in an ice-bath, and then we add the vanilla. Let this cool down. END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't have to be ice-cold, right? END
BEGIN NOW It needs to be ice-cold. It's got to be ice-cold, just what I was saying. END
BEGIN NOW And then we'll go to the machine. END
BEGIN NOW So the ice cream is churned. END
BEGIN NOW Scoop it all out. END
BEGIN NOW And it needs to firm up. END
BEGIN NOW Can I lick the bowl? Sure. Go for it. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] So now this goes in the freezer for four hours. END
BEGIN NOW l right. Cookies are ready, ice cream's ready. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it. END

BEGIN NOW What a great place. END
BEGIN NOW Eclectic, creative, and the food's great. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. Good job. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's it for this trip, but don't worry. END

BEGIN NOW I'll be looking for you next week on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Where are we gonna make these cookies, down in the basement? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, let's go. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] Guilty pleasures are definitely something that you just say, This is a treat. There are foods that I'm, like, addicted to. END
BEGIN NOW GOLD Not only is it irresistible, you kind of know you shouldn't be eating that way. END
BEGIN NOW It's just an amazing sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW BURRELL: Guilty pleasures fall at, like, sort of the tippy-top of the food pyramid. END
BEGIN NOW You know, like, the smallest, but also at the top kind of like the most important. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] This is the type of pizza that I wish was made in New York City. END
BEGIN NOW Angry yelling I'm gonna get in trouble for that. END
BEGIN NOW I love you, New York, and I love New York pizza, but I really love Lou Malrati's pizza. END
BEGIN NOW What is this? What am I doing here? END
BEGIN NOW Turn to the left. END
BEGIN NOW There is one place that I need to go to every single time I'm in Chicago, you know, when the night before has been exceedingly fun. END
BEGIN NOW Now I have a headache and need something salty, greasy, cheesy, and tomato saucy. END
BEGIN NOW That is the guilty pleasure where Lou Malrati's pizza comes in. END
BEGIN NOW This is a splurge. This is a treat. END
BEGIN NOW The crispy, crunchy brown crust I mean, that does it for me. END
BEGIN NOW Lou Malrati's pizza is a Chicago institution. END
BEGIN NOW LINDBERG: We're using the same recipe that we used when we first started back in 1971. END
BEGIN NOW BURRELL: What is so special about it is a couple of things. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a huge appreciator of the Lou's thin crust. END
BEGIN NOW I am a thin-cruster. END
BEGIN NOW Just the way I roll. Sorry, Chicago. END
BEGIN NOW It's not like a New York pizza where it's so thin and you have to fold it in half. END
BEGIN NOW I like the thickness that it's sort of a medium-thick kind of pizza. END
BEGIN NOW LINDBERG: Our thin-crust pizza is ma with our famous butter crust. END
BEGIN NOW It's the same dough that we use in our deep-dish. END
BEGIN NOW You don't want to overwork the dough END
BEGIN NOW All right Whoa! It's hot. END
BEGIN NOW A little warm for you? END
BEGIN NOW But that is hot crab. END
BEGIN NOW That's outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW Without question, the most seafood-flavored crab. Right. END
BEGIN NOW really, I think, has to be the Dungeness. END
BEGIN NOW Some lemon juice. END
BEGIN NOW I'll take a little dip in some butter. END
BEGIN NOW That slaw END
BEGIN NOW Nice crunch. Really refreshes the palate. END
BEGIN NOW That's the freshest experience you can get. END
BEGIN NOW Aa It's juicy. It's succulent. END
BEGIN NOW You don't even need the butter, it's so wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW Dungeness crab dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Dungeness crab is especially sweet. END
BEGIN NOW And it's got such a really good flavor. You can't get it fresher. END
BEGIN NOW WOI like the Fisherman's Market because there's just nothing else like it. END
BEGIN NOW It's extremely unique. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a crazy place. END
BEGIN NOW You got tanks making noise and coolers, people buying fish, dudes cooking right there. END
BEGIN NOW It's different food that you can get from anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW You can get fish and chips with any kind of fish? END
BEGIN NOW Any kind of fish. END
BEGIN NOW Seriously Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW You can't get bored. END
BEGIN NOW You can always try something new. END
BEGIN NOW The Cajun crawfish pie. END
BEGIN NOW Here's the deal. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging out at Fisherman's Market in Eugene, Oregon. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make when we come back? END
BEGIN NOW Crawfish pie. END
BEGIN NOW Cajun crawfish pie. Crawfish pie. END
BEGIN NOW This guy's off the hook. Don't touch any of this. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] thickness? END
BEGIN NOW Welcome back. Triple D. In a little bit of a food coma at the Fisherman's Market in Eugene, Oregon. END
BEGIN NOW Dungeness crab done simply, but outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW It literally has been a mess. END
BEGIN NOW But I'm gonna stop, because you promised me real crawfish pie. END
BEGIN NOW Cajun crawfish pie. END
BEGIN NOW Cajun crawfish pie? END
BEGIN NOW The Cajun crawfish pie is really good. END
BEGIN NOW It's really unusual. The flavor's incredible. END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me of New Orleans. END
BEGIN NOW And how are we gonna start this off? END
BEGIN NOW Bb We're gonna purge the crawfish, get them cleaned up. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. Those are some monsters. END
BEGIN NOW So, these are farm-raised? END
BEGIN NOW No. No. These are wild. No? These are wild-caught? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. They come out of clean lakes, clean streams. END
BEGIN NOW Crazy. ah. END
BEGIN NOW Next step? END
BEGIN NOW Put them in the boiling water. END
BEGIN NOW Seasoned lightly. Salted water. END
BEGIN NOW How long we gonna let them go? END
BEGIN NOW ROGERS: About five minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. They're done. END
BEGIN NOW We'll crack them, peel them, harvest all the meat, then make the pie? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make the filling. END
BEGIN NOW Dump the butter in. END
BEGIN NOW So, just a small, petite amount butter 5 pounds. END
BEGIN NOW Green pepper, diced onion END
BEGIN NOW red pepper, celery. END
BEGIN NOW Let the vegetables sweat. END
BEGIN NOW Next step? Ready for our spices. END
BEGIN NOW We got salt, pepper, granulated onion. END
BEGIN NOW Granulated garlic, so thyme. END
BEGIN NOW Cayenne. Cayenne. END
BEGIN NOW Paprika. And this is the weird one. END
BEGIN NOW Brown sugar? You got it. END
BEGIN NOW All right. So, we'll let this all come together. END
BEGIN NOW And what are we gonna tighten it up with? END
BEGIN NOW So, we put our flour with flavor in. END
BEGIN NOW We add some things to it a little garlic, a little pepper. END
BEGIN NOW You got yourself a little roux. END
BEGIN NOW Get our potatoes in and the crawfish. END
BEGIN NOW Seriously? That much? END
BEGIN NOW Nice, big pieces. Wow! END
BEGIN NOW Meaty pie. END
BEGIN NOW You got to keep the customers happy. END
BEGIN NOW They won't go home. [laughs] That's how much heavy cream we're putting in? END
BEGIN NOW What's wrong with that? 5 pounds of butter and a thimble of heavy cream. END
BEGIN NOW We'll let that simmer till it's all warm. END
BEGIN NOW And then, we're gonna start making these. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start filling the pies. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that is ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna be sending me that for Christmas. END
BEGIN NOW All right. In the oven how long? About 20 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW We got lots of beers to drink while you wait. END
BEGIN NOW Pssh! Fishermen are cool. END
BEGIN NOW Time for pie. END
BEGIN NOW What's that you're putting on top? END
BEGIN NOW Sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW And what do you have over here on the salad? END
BEGIN NOW We got smoked salmon, house salad. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, that's outrageous! END
BEGIN NOW You smoke this in-house? END
BEGIN NOW Of course. END
BEGIN NOW You're so gangster. END
BEGIN NOW Let's look at this. END
BEGIN NOW Great crust. Not soupy. END
BEGIN NOW Not too thick. Tender. END
BEGIN NOW They're as tender and succulent, and the texture of them is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know about the sour-cream thing you were doing, but it's excellent. END
BEGIN NOW This is crazy, man. END
BEGIN NOW It's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Just enough spice to have a little kick. END
BEGIN NOW This is to die for. END
BEGIN NOW It's so flaky. END
BEGIN NOW It just can't get any fresher unless you caught it yourself. END
BEGIN NOW If I'm hungry, I just say, We're going here. This is a full seafood culinary experience from the live tank to the fresh seafood market, doing the food, dishes like that. END
BEGIN NOW How much do you think we can fit in the back of that car? END
BEGIN NOW You know, I'm only about eight hours away from my town. END

BEGIN NOW I'm here in West Des Moines, Iowa, on a warm summer day right off the 235 freeway. END
BEGIN NOW And of all places, I'm in a strip mall, 'cause I hear they're serving up the bomb Ecuadorian food. END
BEGIN NOW This is Mi Patria. END
BEGIN NOW Lomo saltado, table one. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a mom-and-pop shop here. END
BEGIN NOW Got churrasco in the window. END
BEGIN NOW Finding this restaurant here in Des Moines is great. END
BEGIN NOW It's a hidden gem. END
BEGIN NOW This South American treasure is owned by Chef Cesar Miranda, who's been serving up a taste of Ecuador since 2011. END
BEGIN NOW It's just from the heart. END
BEGIN NOW That's what I love the most about it. END
BEGIN NOW Hornado con mote. END
BEGIN NOW I love the pork. END
BEGIN NOW That's one of my favorites. END
BEGIN NOW WOAH! There are so many distinct flavors, but they all blend together so well. END
BEGIN NOW It just makes your taste buds dance. END
BEGIN NOW All right. So, what are we gonna make, man? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make our ho ado con mote, which means pulled pork with Ecuadorian white hominy. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Let's make the pork. END
BEGIN NOW Season first with salt. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW And our house suiza we make the red onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and water. END
BEGIN NOW Then, we add our achiote oil. END
BEGIN NOW It's gonna give it some color. END
BEGIN NOW Water. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna cover it with plastic and foil. END
BEGIN NOW How long we gonna cook this? END
BEGIN NOW 4 1/2 hours. END
BEGIN NOW At what temp? Gotcha. 350. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] That plastic wrap with the foil just locks in all that steam and really cooks that meat down. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW We shred this. We drop it. END
BEGIN NOW Now, what will happen after we shred it? END
BEGIN NOW We got a little bit of achiote oil in it, our pork fat, our white hominy, and season it with salt. END
BEGIN NOW So, where do you get this big, fat corn from? END
BEGIN NOW From Ecuador. END
BEGIN NOW So, you ship corn into Iowa? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna put this together? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. Little white rice, lettuce, our salad. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Our corn. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add our pulled pork, top it with a potato patty. END
BEGIN NOW And that just goes right up on top? END
BEGIN NOW Right on top. END
BEGIN NOW The meat is super-tender, but a lot of uniqueness to it. END
BEGIN NOW Everything's done perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW The hominy is spot-on. END
BEGIN NOW You know, get the acid out of the salad. END
BEGIN NOW Then you get the nuttiness of the corn. END
BEGIN NOW But you put all of that together in this perfect bite. END
BEGIN NOW That's outrageous. END

BEGIN NOW this joint is traditional with a capital two with Italian American classics like pastine soup, veal and peppers, or their Sicilian take on thinly sliced beef. END
BEGIN NOW Braciole is up! END
BEGIN NOW The meat is absolutely tender and delicious. END
BEGIN NOW we're gonna make our basic sauce first, or as we would call it, a gravy. END
BEGIN NOW We start with pork trimmings, oil. END
BEGIN NOW And once that browns up, we add some garlic. END
BEGIN NOW A little rough chop. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're gonna add our onion, hot red pepper seeds. END

BEGIN NOW that's it. END
BEGIN NOW and we're gonna tie these off. END
BEGIN NOW In the pot? in the pot. END
BEGIN NOW we're gonna put some celery and some onions. END

BEGIN NOW That's all right here, right now END
BEGIN NOW I'm here at a cool little town called Geyserville in the northern California wine country to check out a place that I kinda have some history with. END
BEGIN NOW I imagine a coach feels really proud when one of his players turns pro, 'cause that's how I feel when one of my guys that's worked with me in my restaurants ventures out to open his own place. END
BEGIN NOW That brings us here to Catelli’s. END
BEGIN NOW we got your food ready END
BEGIN NOW and his sister Domenica END
BEGIN NOW Spaghetti, d. c. sauce. have come home. END
BEGIN NOW My nonny and nonno, Virginia and Santi, opened Catelli’s in 1935. END
BEGIN NOW table 11. END
BEGIN NOW 'cause we've always dreamt of it. END
BEGIN NOW But the family lost the business back in '91. hello, mama. hi, papa. END

BEGIN NOW Oh yeah. she's ready to roll. okay. END
BEGIN NOW That goes in here. then we just squish it. END
BEGIN NOW And this is going in the fridge for two days. END
BEGIN NOW To really let those flavors come out. END
BEGIN NOW what in the world are we into now? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna roast off the meat, big beef chunks. END
BEGIN NOW and then here's our house-made sausage. END
BEGIN NOW outside of the pasta. END
BEGIN NOW It holds the sauce real well, so I guess it would work good for mac and cheese, but that's not typically what you find for mac and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW We don't do elbows. No elbow? END
BEGIN NOW No elbow. Doing wrong stuff is fun. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, look who's Sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW Look who's talking. END
BEGIN NOW We got the pasta working, and now we're gonna go into the cream sauce. END
BEGIN NOW First, we add the milk and heavy whipping cream. END
BEGIN NOW So, heavy cream really adds the richness to it. Adds the richness. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Into the milk and cream mixture, sea salt, freshly-ground black pepper, ground nutmeg. END
BEGIN NOW I'm just gonna bring it to a simmer. END
BEGIN NOW This mac and cheese was written up in a big paper. END
BEGIN NOW Somebody stole the recipe. Borrowed the recipe? END
BEGIN NOW Man, this was a big deal in Clarkston, Michigan. END
BEGIN NOW We almost had some gangster activity going on here over the mac and cheese. END
BEGIN NOW How was there not a song about this? END
BEGIN NOW Wrote plenty of songs about mackin'. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] What's the next step? We start the roux. END
BEGIN NOW Butter, diced onions, garlic paste. END
BEGIN NOW Pureed garlic? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW And now the flour to build the roux. END
BEGIN NOW A roux's made. END
BEGIN NOW Milk and the cream have simmered. END
BEGIN NOW The noodles are finished. What's the next step? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add the hot milk mixture to the roux, and we're gonna let it thicken, then we're gonna add some parmesan cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Are we gonna make Bob cook all, or are we just gonna stand here and look good at this? I thought you just took some noodles, cheese, and some all purpose, milk and threw it in the oven. END
BEGIN NOW What's pap milk? It's like a cream sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, it's, like, for your dog or something. END
BEGIN NOW That's pap milk. Guys from California. END
BEGIN NOW We don't know stuff like this. END
BEGIN NOW So, now you chill it before you add it to the pasta, and then you add the cold pasta and the cold cheese sauce. END
BEGIN NOW You all together. END
BEGIN NOW That is tight, man Give a rundown. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we're gonna add the sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna put more cream in, more half and half. END
BEGIN NOW You are not short on the dairy on this, man. END
BEGIN NOW Got to do it by hand so you can feel the love. END
BEGIN NOW That's it. That's how you know it's done. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna put it into dishes. END
BEGIN NOW Some Pinconning Cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Have you had this Pinconning Cheese, this super cheddar? I wouldn't know what to ca it. END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't even know how to pronounce that. END
BEGIN NOW It comes in a wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, good stuff, man. END
BEGIN NOW Got to layer that cheese in there - two layers in the mac. Sharp white cheddar. END
BEGIN NOW Now you go with a little panko on top. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we take this. We're gonna bake it off. END
BEGIN NOW What temp? 425, about 12 mites. END
BEGIN NOW I usually clip it open and let it steam a little bit, then you get some of the crust, get noodle in there. Do you see the steam coming up? END
BEGIN NOW Did you just shove that in your mouth already? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Did you hear that Kid Rock canceled seven concerts? END
BEGIN NOW Why? Oh, he's hanging out with Guy Fieri. END
BEGIN NOW He ate hot mac and cheese. He kicked his taste buds. END
BEGIN NOW ! You got the cheese right in there, then you got the cream, then you got the crunch on top with the white cheddar, which has got me real nice tang to it. END
BEGIN NOW That is in the bomb cheese category. END
BEGIN NOW thank you. END
BEGIN NOW It's very rich. It's really good. END
BEGIN NOW Can you eat the whole thing in the first place? END
BEGIN NOW No, I eat half, and then I take the rest to go. END
BEGIN NOW Meat loaf. END
BEGIN NOW What's the whole foundation of food? END
BEGIN NOW We do broad-shouldered, American comfort food with a Mediterranean twist. END
BEGIN NOW We let the food do the talking. END
BEGIN NOW Kid Rock, he says some of the best he's ever had. END
BEGIN NOW This is a man who travels a lot, so, like, his word obviously means a lot, and we're fortunate that he comes in. END
BEGIN NOW It is real deal just an all-American joint. END
BEGIN NOW That why we built it. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking Spanish we're filling up at a gas station END
BEGIN NOW I mean, this is the real deal serving authentic Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here in Elkridge, Maryland, right outside of Baltimore, getting a little fuel for the '68 and a little fuel for the Guy. END
BEGIN NOW Now, the crazy thing is when you're doing a Triple D road trip You pull into a place like this and find out that they've got the bomb taqueria right next door. END
BEGIN NOW The other crazy thing is you have your buddy Joe. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, Joe! What? END
BEGIN NOW Joe Theissman, that is. END
BEGIN NOW You like tacos? Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW Check it out. This is R&R Taqueria. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] Four chicken tacos. END
BEGIN NOW Have you guys been here before? Of course. END
BEGIN NOW And this is where you bring her for a date is back here in the corner of a gas station? END
BEGIN NOW Every time, it's excellent. END
BEGIN NOW Rodrigo is from Mexico, and I think he brings what he learned growing up in his mother's kitchen to the restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW Must've been a righteous place to get cooking skills, 'cause Rodrigo Albarran-Torres used them to pay for flight school before landing back in the restaurant biz in 2009. END
BEGIN NOW [Speaking Spanish] Here's the play I've got two quarterbacks, one a Super Bowl champ in Joe, who lives nearby, the other a super chef in Rodrigo. END
BEGIN NOW It's game on. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] What was so attractive about being right in a gas station? END
BEGIN NOW I opened this place I started thinking about putting authentic Mexican food, and I realized it's not the location. END
BEGIN NOW It's really the food. END
BEGIN NOW It can be real deal although it's not tables and chairs. END
BEGIN NOW Correct. END
BEGIN NOW Speaking Spanish What are we making first? So, we're gonna work on the al pastor. END
BEGIN NOW The is a pork butt. What are you talking about, pork butt? END
BEGIN NOW I know pork butt. That's my middle name is pork butt. END
BEGIN NOW You'll notice there's two cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. So that works out very well. END
BEGIN NOW Stop, you're gonna get me kicked off the network. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna slice them first. Start out thin. END
BEGIN NOW I don't have a telestrator with me, okay? END
BEGIN NOW I got a pen. I got a plate Now, what he does is he takes it and slices it just a little bit, then grabs it, peels it off. END
BEGIN NOW What you do is you get a nice, even cut like that. END
BEGIN NOW This is the Triple D telestrator. END
BEGIN NOW Guajillo chilies my favorite chili. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't get any better. Doesn't get any better. END
BEGIN NOW This is for the al pastor sauce. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna take these, break them down, take the steams and the seeds off them. END
BEGIN NOW Let this steep in the warm water. END
BEGIN NOW Then into the blender with all the ingredients? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're gonna put oregano. END
BEGIN NOW Thyme leaves. END
BEGIN NOW You're getting in his way. END
BEGIN NOW Garlic. I'm helping. END
BEGIN NOW I'm an assistant. Pineapple. END
BEGIN NOW Pepper. You got have the pineapple. END
BEGIN NOW The enzyme of the pineapple helps in the marinating process. END
BEGIN NOW Cinnamon. A little cinnamon. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so, now we're taking the guajillos and the chile de árbol. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna put them in the blender. END
BEGIN NOW And a little bit of that pepper water. END
BEGIN NOW You got to save that. END
BEGIN NOW And this isn't super spicy. END
BEGIN NOW It's a very But it's very flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW Not spicy. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna go ahead and mix it up all in the pork, the onions. END
BEGIN NOW How long does it marinate? END
BEGIN NOW We usually marinate for a day. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you know it's got some good flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW Rodrigo, what are we doing, Chef? END
BEGIN NOW Right now, we're doing huarache. Huarache. END
BEGIN NOW Means, like, flip-flop, like sandal? END
BEGIN NOW A sandal. Give us a rundown. END
BEGIN NOW Corn flour, masa, and a little bit of water. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you mix this with your feet, Joe. END
BEGIN NOW A little salt. END
BEGIN NOW You want to get this just to the right point. END
BEGIN NOW It's nice and light and fluffy. Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Refried beans. END
BEGIN NOW Make a cup, fill it, fold it. END
BEGIN NOW That looks like a little football. END
BEGIN NOW Everything looks like a little football to you. It does. END
BEGIN NOW Now you just roll this out, and then we're gonna cook this on the flat-top while we cook the al pastor? END
BEGIN NOW Correct. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] Look at those huaraches, man! END
BEGIN NOW Oaxaca cheese, and this cheese right here comes in a ball. END
BEGIN NOW And you peel it off. It's kind of like mozzarella. END
BEGIN NOW Al pastor. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW A little parm cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Parmesan in Mexican food? END
BEGIN NOW Now you got your red sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Avocado. END
BEGIN NOW The key is, you've got to season it correctly, cook it correctly. END
BEGIN NOW It's got to have that chauuto it, so cooking it on the flat-top is critical. END
BEGIN NOW The meat is tender enough. It's not overcooked. END
BEGIN NOW You taste the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW The avocado gives it a nice freshness. END
BEGIN NOW The salsa gives you a little bit of sniffs my nose is running. END
BEGIN NOW Listen Yep, what you just heard is Guy Fieri's career ending. END
BEGIN NOW It's not too much of any one thing. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, this is the real deal. END
BEGIN NOW I'm serious, and I eat a lot of Mexican food. END
BEGIN NOW Outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW Any restaurant that can get by where there's no place to sit down really It's all about the food. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you got to love it. Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Tacos enchilados. END

BEGIN NOW Course, I got to always get the back end. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you very much. Rodrigo, what's this all about? END
BEGIN NOW We're about to do some lamb tacos. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna chop it up and roast the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW No processed stuff here. END
BEGIN NOW So, you got the lamb broken down. END
BEGIN NOW Do you have a certain way that you stack this in here? END
BEGIN NOW Just want to make sure this meat is exposed Mm and make sure it's cooked. END
BEGIN NOW Next? The vegetables. END
BEGIN NOW So you got some onions and some tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW And use a little beef base. END
BEGIN NOW Basically, we're braising it. Correct. END
BEGIN NOW This is the real key Now, these you have to get sent in from Mexico, right? Yes, they're from Mexico. END
BEGIN NOW Avocado three leaves. END
BEGIN NOW You won't recognize the flavor specifically. END
BEGIN NOW It's not like you're gonna have a leaf from an orange tree or you're gonna be able to smell it like that, but it is real unique flavor. END
BEGIN NOW A little salt? A little salt. END
BEGIN NOW These banana leaves, man, this is the way to go because they're waxy. END
BEGIN NOW It holds the moisture in. END
BEGIN NOW This was your plastic wrap in Mexico. END

BEGIN NOW Here, Steve whips them into shape while Andi runs the kitchen, a. k. a. an Airstream trailer, and cranks out her family favorites END
BEGIN NOW Order up potpie! END
BEGIN NOW which are very, very unique. END
BEGIN NOW We're baking in this? We're baking in that. END
BEGIN NOW This I got to see. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start by making the dough. END
BEGIN NOW Flour. END
BEGIN NOW A little kosher salt. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, and we're gonna cut in our butter. END
BEGIN NOW Wow. [laughs] Pulse that in. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Get in there. END
BEGIN NOW Form it into a big ball. Let this rest? END
BEGIN NOW and let it rest. END
BEGIN NOW Flatten it out a little bit so it's easier to roll. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Good to go. END
BEGIN NOW Then we use the tops of our mason jars to cut a circle. END
BEGIN NOW Build the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW Form the sides. END
BEGIN NOW And then I've got to cut the tops out. END
BEGIN NOW Here we go. You power-bake them. END
BEGIN NOW These go in there pop in the oven at 350, two, three minutes. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna get into the filing? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make the filling. Start with butter. END
BEGIN NOW So you feel that it's okay to give copious amounts of butter in your food END
BEGIN NOW I do. because you have a boxing ring? END
BEGIN NOW I fatten them up. Steve trims them down. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add boneless chicken thighs. END
BEGIN NOW Get your fly with the chicken thigh. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't dry out as much as white meat does. END
BEGIN NOW We tried it with white meat. END
BEGIN NOW And then brown that. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna add in a little chopped onion and add diced celery, and diced little carrot. END
BEGIN NOW A little kosher salt We're gonna add in a little chicken stock. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna let that simmer. END
BEGIN NOW So, while that's browning, we're gonna make the roux. END
BEGIN NOW We're going to start with a little butter. END
BEGIN NOW Whisk in a little flour to thicken a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, with the chicken stock. Add the chicken stock. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy cream. END
BEGIN NOW Stir that till it thickens. END
BEGIN NOW So, the roux goes in with the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW And now the corn so it stays nice and tender. END
BEGIN NOW Parsley. END
BEGIN NOW So, we'll let it continue to tighten up. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so, we have these baked off. [chuckles] Now you're gonna fill them. END
BEGIN NOW All the way to the top. END
BEGIN NOW That's a nice, little portion you're giving in there. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna top it with a circle of pie dough. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna pop them in the oven. END
BEGIN NOW And they're ready to taste. END
BEGIN NOW Smoking hot. END
BEGIN NOW Really nice, flaky crust, and the key corn. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh corn. END
BEGIN NOW But the kicker Chicken thigh makes it. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. END
BEGIN NOW That dark meat. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW is still tender and great flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, there's a little bit of crust on the side. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! There you go. END
BEGIN NOW Come to papa. END
BEGIN NOW Muffled Nice job. END
BEGIN NOW Give me some of that. It's amazing. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, it's loaded with vegetables, which is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW It's almost like a cookie. END
BEGIN NOW It's got a little sweetness to it, but it is just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW Good job you got the gym right next door. END
BEGIN NOW I plan on working out after I eat. END
BEGIN NOW Bell dings Have you guys been in the ring? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW I boxed my brother two days before his wedding in that ring 'cause his rehearsal dinner was here. END
BEGIN NOW Seriously? END
BEGIN NOW And what is your favorite menu item? END
BEGIN NOW The mac-and-cheese bites. END
BEGIN NOW These are good. Mac-and-cheese muffins. END
BEGIN NOW Mac-and-cheese muffins. END
BEGIN NOW one of my favorite words. END
BEGIN NOW Butter? Butter! END
BEGIN NOW Flour. END
BEGIN NOW And add in the milk. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add a little Worcestershire. END
BEGIN NOW Have some salt here, too. Would you like that? END
BEGIN NOW I would love that. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're ready for the Gruyère. END
BEGIN NOW Whose recipe was this? This is mine. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add a little cheddar. END
BEGIN NOW Local goat cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Local go cheese? Unbelievable taste. END
BEGIN NOW Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW I like the tang of that. END
BEGIN NOW I fold that in and dump the pasta down. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, we should probably just test this. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna be fine. END
BEGIN NOW it's on, is it? END
BEGIN NOW Cut! END
BEGIN NOW We're actually gonna make a little bit of a panko mixture to put on the bottom of the muffin tins. END
BEGIN NOW Start with panko crumbs. END
BEGIN NOW Extra virgin olive oil. END
BEGIN NOW Add in some fresh ground garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Want me to hit this? Yes, please. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Really good so they come right out easily. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, really good. Like, really good. END
BEGIN NOW A little fresh parmasean cheese. END
BEGIN NOW So, that little mixture now? END
BEGIN NOW Now we're going to fill it. END
BEGIN NOW Just fill a little bit on the bottom of each. END
BEGIN NOW While you do that, I'm just gonna make sure that nothing has changed over here on this. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Still okay. END
BEGIN NOW Now we blind bake this off? END
BEGIN NOW Yep, brown for about a minute. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're going to fill them. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] What? END
BEGIN NOW Sprinkle a little bit of the panko. You sprinkle that on top so it gets a little crunch on top. END
BEGIN NOW Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Bake them off. END
BEGIN NOW For about 8 to 10 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW 10 muffins in a basket. END
BEGIN NOW Ahh, it's like culinary Christmas! END
BEGIN NOW Look at that little c-and-cheese nugget/slammer/popper. END
BEGIN NOW And whatever of the fat of the cheese that was melting got captured down here in the little panko zone. END
BEGIN NOW The key is the outside crunchiness. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Mm This is like an extra week, now, at the gym. END
BEGIN NOW You're the bomb, Andi. END
BEGIN NOW You got to try this one. END
BEGIN NOW Does everybody in Phoenix know about this? END
BEGIN NOW It's still a little underground, but more and more people are finding out about it. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you can't beat it. END
BEGIN NOW It's just The Duce. END
BEGIN NOW Coming up END
BEGIN NOW One, two, three, and one for me. END
BEGIN NOW we're headed to Vancouver for some legit seafood END
BEGIN NOW Right in there. It's a shovel bag! END
BEGIN NOW There you go. So, I just I wear it! END
BEGIN NOW coming out of a streamlined mobile kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW Somebody has got to take all of his moves and put this to some disco music. END
BEGIN NOW I'm cruising through the downtown of Vancouver, British Columbia, just a few blocks from the water. END
BEGIN NOW Now, the business people in this area are looking for a quick lunch. END
BEGIN NOW The great thing about this corner is, they can get a quick lunch that's also fresh, local, and wild. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh seafood? Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW That does it? Oh, absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW We're literally a block away from the ocean. END
BEGIN NOW Finding organic food in a street truck is not easy. END
BEGIN NOW But chef and owner Josh Wolfe wouldn't really call this a street truck anyway. END
BEGIN NOW I call it a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW Just happens to have wheels on it. END
BEGIN NOW 'Cause this place is a permanent fixture on downtown Vancouver's Burrard and West Hastings. END
BEGIN NOW So, how'd you pick this corner? END
BEGIN NOW For me, it was really important to be in a spot where people do lunch. END
BEGIN NOW I want people who want to eat. END
BEGIN NOW No problem. END
BEGIN NOW Vancouver's a city that really believes in their food. END
BEGIN NOW Local food is something that's really important to us. END
BEGIN NOW So, of course, you got to have the Canadian mashup, poutine. END
BEGIN NOW How do you describe it here? Classic poutine French fries a beef gravy or a brown gravy, and cheese curds. END
BEGIN NOW But this poutine is the fresh, local, wild way. END
BEGIN NOW We're not gonna use brown gravy. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make seafood gravy 'cause END
BEGIN NOW Of course we are. I don't know if you noticed, but the ocean's two blocks away. END
BEGIN NOW I dig it, I dig it and you got people starting to line up, so what are we gonna cook? END
BEGIN NOW Butter. We use a little bit of canola oil. END
BEGIN NOW We got our fat down there. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna lay our base flavor layer down. END
BEGIN NOW Shallots, garlic. END
BEGIN NOW A little fennel You okay with that? Ooh! END
BEGIN NOW Carrots, a little celery. Give them a little stir. END
BEGIN NOW We'll get them sweated down just a little bit, and then we're gonna hit them with the love. END
BEGIN NOW This is gonna get ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW I know, I know, I know, I know. END
BEGIN NOW Clams going down. END
BEGIN NOW Now we need the liquid. END
BEGIN NOW Good, old white wine. Bay leaves little aromatics. END
BEGIN NOW Black pepper. White pepper. Imitates French laugh Coriander seed beautiful with shellfish. END
BEGIN NOW Déjeuniez. END
BEGIN NOW J-j-juniper! END
BEGIN NOW Fantastic, and now just to round it out, a little bit of fresh thyme. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna seal the deal. END
BEGIN NOW Let them steam. Keep all the liquid in there When those clams start to open, we're gonna throw down our mussels 'cause we don't want to overcook anything. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna try and do it all right. END
BEGIN NOW Somebody has got to take all of his moves and put this to some disco music. END
BEGIN NOW Disco music playing He has got so much animation, I want Stayin' Alive. I want a little Bee Gees. END
BEGIN NOW Breathing rhythmically We're gonna separate the liquid from the mussels and clams and we're gonna chill those down so we can handle them. END
BEGIN NOW Now these are cooled down to where you can handle them. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that beautiful mussel. END
BEGIN NOW So, clams and mussels Shells back in. END
BEGIN NOW Shells back in. END
BEGIN NOW Next up? Now we need something put all those beautiful shellfish into, so we're gonna talk chowder. END
BEGIN NOW So, really, we are making a chowder? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, we are making a chowder. That's gonna go over fries? END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] That's bacon. That's smoked bacon. Okay, pork belly. Nice. END
BEGIN NOW Equal part onion. We're gonna start those melting down. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna throw in the same base flavors that we used. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna sweat all that out. END
BEGIN NOW So, we're rendered down. We got enough fat in there. END
BEGIN NOW Now we'll add a little flour, build a roux. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're just gonna stir it real good, make sure everything's coated. END
BEGIN NOW What are you throwing in next? END
BEGIN NOW A little me of that white wine. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Limited moisture, maximum flavor. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I'm gonna overeat. I can already tell. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] A little heavy cream. END
BEGIN NOW So, you got the nice richness of the heavy cream working with the roux, but it doesn't have to be all heavy cream if you have a nice roux in there. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna use milk for the rest of that. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is the liquor that we strained out from all the shells that we cooked. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you did. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you did! END
BEGIN NOW All right, so, we're gonna bring this up to a simmer. END
BEGIN NOW To serve this, we're gonna take our portion of gravy. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add those beautiful shellfish that we picked before. END
BEGIN NOW That much shellfish?! Yeah, why not? END
BEGIN NOW That's more shellfish than you get at most seafood restaurants for a nice plate at $21.99 Well, tell everyone you know. END
BEGIN NOW Alright, fries down, and that gravy's nice and bubbly hot. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna throw a little parsley to finish it. END
BEGIN NOW Ladies and gentlemen, you are stepping into the ridiculous zone. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the cascading deliciousness. END
BEGIN NOW My friend, that looks dynamite. END
BEGIN NOW ere you go. Now, how do you attack it? END
BEGIN NOW Just dump it right in there. It's a shovel bag! END
BEGIN NOW ere you go. So, I just I wear it! END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna try to do the old chopstick French fry. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. That's one of the new methods. END
BEGIN NOW There we go! END
BEGIN NOW Delicate flavor, rich flavor, not over-seasoned, super-crunchy fries, and look at all the seafood. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that big mussel right there. END
BEGIN NOW I've had some crazy fries in my life. END
BEGIN NOW This is the first time I've ever had seafood fries, and incredibly well done. END
BEGIN NOW Here we go, guys! I got those poutines you're dying for! END
BEGIN NOW In the world of poutine, this is. Absolutely delicious. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think makes it so good? Good-quality food. END
BEGIN NOW Like, you can tell everything's made fresh. END
BEGIN NOW WOLFE: Fresh fish comes, a lot of it, directly from the fishermen. END
BEGIN NOW There's boats coming in every day. END
BEGIN NOW You're a block away from the water. I am. END
BEGIN NOW I'm four blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf. END
BEGIN NOW B. C. 's known for some absolutely stunning oysters. END
BEGIN NOW These happen to be some of the biggest ones you can find. END
BEGIN NOW And he's piling them up po'-boy style for a chicken-fried oyster sandwich with trailer-made tartar sauce. END
BEGIN NOW What are we making? Buttermilk The buttermilk has a really nice acidity to it. END
BEGIN NOW A creamy acidity. A creamy acidity. END
BEGIN NOW Which mixes well with this. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW A little of my favorite hot sauce I know. Sriracha Just a little. Maybe a little more. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Oysters are going down. END
BEGIN NOW We take them, we marinate them. All right, in the fridge. END
BEGIN NOW Go to marinate. Okay, and then what are we gonna dredge them? END
BEGIN NOW Just a little simple flour. All-purpose flour. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the size of these things. Those are big boys. END
BEGIN NOW How many come in an order? END
BEGIN NOW Three, but I'm gonna eat one off the edge the while you're eating the sandwich. Oh, is that how that's gonna work? END
BEGIN NOW I'm a little selfish right now. I'm thinking about me. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW And then we'll fry some oysters. Then we're gonna cook some oysters. END
BEGIN NOW Down into some canola oil. END
BEGIN NOW S those gorgeous Ready? Pull them! END
BEGIN NOW Little salt the end. END
BEGIN NOW Boom, we're gonna serve them up. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful, soft, toasted bun. END
BEGIN NOW Tartar sauce on both sides. END
BEGIN NOW One, two, three. And one for me. END
BEGIN NOW All right. Romaine lettuce. END
BEGIN NOW I love shredded romaine lettuce on this one. END
BEGIN NOW It's simple. That's all you. Look at that! END
BEGIN NOW [laughing] Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I know that look! END
BEGIN NOW Delicious. This is simple. END
BEGIN NOW It's rich. It's delicate. END
BEGIN NOW Nice tartar sauce to complement, and just a nice, little crunch on the outside of a monster of an oyster. END
BEGIN NOW You killed it completely, man. END
BEGIN NOW It's actually my favorite sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW homemade tartar sauce is out of this world. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think?! END
BEGIN NOW She's saying it's very delicious. END
BEGIN NOW The seafood's incredibly fresh. END
BEGIN NOW Was I correct? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Congrats, man. You rock it out. Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW Big time. Cheers. END
BEGIN NOW Guy's bananas. END
BEGIN NOW He's wild, ridiculous, and out of control. END
BEGIN NOW Or fresh, local, and wild. You call it. END
BEGIN NOW Up a head on our hour of wild joints END
BEGIN NOW This is gonna get messy. END
BEGIN NOW an old feed store in Oregon END
BEGIN NOW Try and put that in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I'm about 10 miles southeast of Tacoma, Washington, in Puyallup. END
BEGIN NOW Now, as most of you know, it's home to the Puyalp Fair, one of the top 10 fairs in the country, but for me, I'm here for a funky, little Triple D joint. END
BEGIN NOW It was once a feed store, then an antique shop, and now it's Crockett's Public House. END
BEGIN NOW Mom's sloppy joe coming up! END
BEGIN NOW I actually eat here more than I probably eat at home. END
BEGIN NOW This is the place? This is the place. END
BEGIN NOW All cheer Dreamt up and built up by owner Shaun Brobak END
BEGIN NOW I'm a career restaurant guy. END
BEGIN NOW who got his start washing dishes at age 16. END
BEGIN NOW I practiced and got experience on everybody else's restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW Smartest thing in the world you can do. END
BEGIN NOW And he found a kindred spirit in Chef Brian Johnston. END
BEGIN NOW I started out washing dishes. END
BEGIN NOW Really cool chef gave me a shot. END
BEGIN NOW Now a couple of guys who came through the ranks are dropping culinary bombs on the peeps of Puyallup like this mesquite-smoked peel-away piece of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Fire-grilled artichokes up! END
BEGIN NOW Give me the breakdown. END
BEGIN NOW You want to take the bottom leaves off a little bit tougher. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna peel the bottom leas and the stem, start seeing just the white part in the middle that's real tender. That tender meat, kind of like the heart of the artichoke. END
BEGIN NOW Then you're gonna want to cut it in half right down the middle of the stem. END
BEGIN NOW Got it. Get it cut in half. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that, huh? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna dig out all the fibers on the inside right down to the bottom of the artichoke, then they go straight in the boiling water. END
BEGIN NOW Is the water salted? END
BEGIN NOW Salted, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so, we let these go for 10 minutes, pull them out, hit them in an ice bath. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Now, we're gonna make the Calabrian aioli from Calabria, the peppers. END
BEGIN NOW You want to take the seeds out of them first. END
BEGIN NOW Seeds and stems are off. END
BEGIN NOW The lemon juice. END
BEGIN NOW And we have some Dijon mustard. END
BEGIN NOW Puree the pepper. END
BEGIN NOW This is gonna be strong, huh? END
BEGIN NOW Probably a little spicy. [whistles] All right, so, we're gonna take this. END
BEGIN NOW Now fold it into the mayo. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW All right, artichokes are done. END
BEGIN NOW The artichokes are ready. You can take them to the grill. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna brush them with a little bit of canola oil, and we're gonna season them a little seasoning salt. END
BEGIN NOW They go right on the fire. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent. END
BEGIN NOW I'm an artichoke-eating machine. END
BEGIN NOW And then serve that with the Calabrian aioli? END
BEGIN NOW This is my favorite part getting right down here to the heart of it. END
BEGIN NOW Into a little bit of that aioli. END
BEGIN NOW Nice and tender. END
BEGIN NOW Just give it a little dip right there. END
BEGIN NOW And the kicker is that smoke from the mesquite. END
BEGIN NOW I wish you would've made some for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW You're not sharin'? Here's the deal. END
BEGIN NOW My name's not Sharon. It Guy Fieri. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think that we've ever done roasted artichokes on Triple D, and I don't think I've ever had one of the chefs call me Sharon. [laughs] Couple firsts. END
BEGIN NOW Artichokes in the window! END
BEGIN NOW I have never tasted anything quite like this. END
BEGIN NOW Plating flagship! END
BEGIN NOW And this joint's got a menu with everything END
BEGIN NOW Colossal shrimp! END
BEGIN NOW but the kitchen sink. END
BEGIN NOW St. Louis ribs in the window! END
BEGIN NOW And he's been turning this classic Italian dish END
BEGIN NOW Public House meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW into a high-end, meaty feast. END
BEGIN NOW Now we make the meatballs. Yep. END
BEGIN NOW We've got gelatin and water. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna bloom the gelatin first. END
BEGIN NOW It's gonna kind of hold the meatballs together, and we'll set that aside. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're going bread crumbs. END
BEGIN NOW Buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Incorporate all that fat and a little bit of that tang. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're just using the egg yolk just for the richness. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh garlic. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] Next, we use the gelatin that we bloomed. END
BEGIN NOW Get it mixed in with the bread crumbs. END
BEGIN NOW We've got fresh ground pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Cayenne pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of heat. END
BEGIN NOW White pepper, chili flakes, kosher salt. END
BEGIN NOW Just get it all mixed in. END
BEGIN NOW Next up, we're going with ground veal, then we're going with the Kurobuta pork. END
BEGIN NOW Kurobuta pork, so you're talking, like, the high end of pork. END
BEGIN NOW And then we've got fresh-ground sirloin. END
BEGIN NOW Big in flavor. END
BEGIN NOW So you're using the big three, which I think is completely necessary, but you're going to the extreme. END
BEGIN NOW And then the prosciutto, also. END
BEGIN NOW Of course. END
BEGIN NOW These are $95 meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Mix that. END
BEGIN NOW Now, what would you like me to do besides finish the prosciutto? END
BEGIN NOW Well, if we have any left, we're gonna put the prosciutto in. END
BEGIN NOW Uh-huh. Mr. Funny-funny. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Got fresh-chopped parsley. END
BEGIN NOW Mm Italian? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Grated Pecorino Romano. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna mix one more time. END
BEGIN NOW So, now we're gonna form the meatballs about 4½½ ounces. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna roast these off in the oven 350, 20, 25 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW All right, man Meatballs are done? END
BEGIN NOW Yep. Meatballs done. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so we've got our marinara. END
BEGIN NOW Three meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna go chopped pistachios. END
BEGIN NOW Seriously? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't see that coming. END
BEGIN NOW The Grana Padano. END
BEGIN NOW Parmesan cheese. [laughs] I like this move. Fresh, grated lime zest. END
BEGIN NOW Adds a nice, little zing to it. END
BEGIN NOW Aa There we go! END
BEGIN NOW This is gonna get messy. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] END
BEGIN NOW That's a really tender meatball. END
BEGIN NOW It's real traditional in the way you made it, using the three meats. END
BEGIN NOW You add your own little twist to it, throwing these pistachios on top. END
BEGIN NOW But the lime zest really key. END
BEGIN NOW Needs a little more prosciutto, though. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Public House meatballs up! END
BEGIN NOW These meatballs are amazing. END
BEGIN NOW This is a wonderful treat for a meal. END
BEGIN NOW What are we gonna make next? END
BEGIN NOW Mom's sloppy joe. END
BEGIN NOW Let's start it off. END
BEGIN NOW Start with canola oil, hot pan. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] We're going fresh-ground sirloin. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] Fresh-ground Kurobuta pork. END
BEGIN NOW Meat's browned. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add diced red onion and diced red bell pepper. END
BEGIN NOW We got fresh minced garlic, some minced jalapeños. END
BEGIN NOW And then we're gonna stir and kind of let it cook a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Next up? END
BEGIN NOW Gonna hit it with some red wine. END
BEGIN NOW Some red-wine vinegar And some Worcestershire sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Tomato paste. END
BEGIN NOW Dark brown sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Dry mustard. Cumin. END
BEGIN NOW Cayenne pepper. Paprika. END
BEGIN NOW It's like speed sloppy. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh black pepper and kosher salt. END
BEGIN NOW Mix it all up, let it cook down. END
BEGIN NOW How long's this gonna cook? END
BEGIN NOW This is gonna cook for about a half hour, 40 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Tapping Ready? I'm ready. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. We're gonna go coleslaw first. END
BEGIN NOW Then we've got a sesame-seed brioche bun Got our hot sloppy joe mix here. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] And it is sloppy. END
BEGIN NOW Put a big pile of crispy, fried onion rings. END
BEGIN NOW Just got the bun on the side. END
BEGIN NOW And that's it. END
BEGIN NOW Try to put that in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW That's ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW You guys haven't seen the hunch in a while, have you? END
BEGIN NOW Arms up, loosening the neck, rotating. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yeah! END
BEGIN NOW In the world of sloppy joes, there has to be some key pieces. END
BEGIN NOW One, the tang. END
BEGIN NOW Got to have a little bit of heat, not hot, but a little bit of heat, little bit of spice, but the key important piece is texture. END
BEGIN NOW There's got to be texture in the meat. END
BEGIN NOW This has got all those components, and then the kicker END
BEGIN NOW get some of these onion straws. END
BEGIN NOW Great sloppy joe. That is up there. END
BEGIN NOW Whosever mom made this, she's The Mom The Bomb. com. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah Mom's sloppy joe coming up! END
BEGIN NOW I don't know that I would've driven through this little town and thought I was gonna find food like this, but this is the kind of joints we want in Triple D. Coming up END
BEGIN NOW This might be one of the funkiest things we've ever tried. END
BEGIN NOW we're headed to the basement END
BEGIN NOW for a jamming restaurant going way, way out with the waffles. END
BEGIN NOW Shut the front door! END
BEGIN NOW On the road to Flavortown I say it all the time if it's funky, I'll find it. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here in Syracuse, New York, right by the campus this is called S. U. Hill to check out a joint that's funky. END
BEGIN NOW How funky? you ask. END
BEGIN NOW So funky, it's called Funk-n-Waffles. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, wait, wait END
BEGIN NOW Rapping indistinctly And this is like adult version of waffles. END
BEGIN NOW Falafel waffle. There's nothing like it. END
BEGIN NOW Wait, wait, wait END
BEGIN NOW Who runs around with a bunch of waffle irons? END
BEGIN NOW These guys. END
BEGIN NOW Syracuse grads Kyle Corea and Adam Gold. END
BEGIN NOW We threw these crazy house parties when we were in college. END
BEGIN NOW I'd be deejaying with my buddy, and my business partner Kyle would be slinging waffles at the bar. END
BEGIN NOW Get your beer. You get your waffles. Really? END
BEGIN NOW Just handing them out. And in 2007, they made it legit and kept it underground when they opened this joint in the basement. END
BEGIN NOW Savory waffles and breakfast waffles and lunch waffles and fries chicken and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW Battered fried chicken on top of a fresh buttermilk waffle. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make some buttermilk batter here. END
BEGIN NOW For? END
BEGIN NOW The fried chicken and waffle dish. END
BEGIN NOW And the batter is for the. For the waffle, but we're also gonna use the batter for the chicken. END
BEGIN NOW That's like chicken and waffles to another level. It is. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start with the buttermilk first. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna pour this milk right here. END
BEGIN NOW Next up, we're gonna bring this thing to temp. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna use the espresso machine's steamer. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make our own buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Living on the edge. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so now, lemon juice. END
BEGIN NOW Gonna turn this into our buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW You don't even need to mix it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna separate some eggs, like this style. END
BEGIN NOW Gangster. Oh, yeah. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna whisk these egg whites till they're a bit foamy. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're gonna mix the buttermilk and the egg whites. END
BEGIN NOW Throw them in there. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna whisk the yolks a bit. END
BEGIN NOW So, we are going to add the yolks and the butter together into the rest of the wet mix. END
BEGIN NOW All right, let's keep this thing popping. END
BEGIN NOW Dry time We're gonna start with our local, organic, all-purpose white flour. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna throw in sugar. END
BEGIN NOW All right, we got salt and the baking powder. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Now I'm gonna whisk it up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Put the wet in the dry mix. END
BEGIN NOW And now the waffle batter's ready go. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make some fried chicken wings. END
BEGIN NOW First, we're gonna marinate the wings in buttermilk? That's right. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna let it soak overnight. END
BEGIN NOW Next up, we're gonna make a dredge. END
BEGIN NOW Organic A. P. END
BEGIN NOW Some bread crumbs. Paprika. END
BEGIN NOW Cayenne joink. Joink? END
BEGIN NOW You hear that on Scooby-Doo. It's always zoink. That's your own That's my own thing. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Garlic powder. New sound? END
BEGIN NOW Ska-blam. [laughs] Kosher salt. Black pepper. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Let's whisk these guys up. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's the dredge. So, let's get some of this. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that foamy frothing. See, it kind of changed a little bit right? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. It thickened up. END
BEGIN NOW We're going to load it up in this guy, thin this out with a little bit of whole milk. END
BEGIN NOW That's just 'cause it would be way too coaty-coaty. END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW Stir it up. Now it's thin enough. END
BEGIN NOW Time to batter these wings. END
BEGIN NOW Go! Let's get this up in here. END
BEGIN NOW All right, there's our six. END

BEGIN NOW It's all right. We can make a little mess. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. There we go. And we're gonna spin her. END
BEGIN NOW There's another move that we do here So, we drop it like this That way, when it wants to expand, it's locked in. END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna start hearing some funny sounds. END
BEGIN NOW Squeaking What is going on right now? END
BEGIN NOW This is still gurgling. END
BEGIN NOW Urgling is the term? It's urgling? END
BEGIN NOW I clearly should just write like a new dictionary for this restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW The Funk-n dictionary. All right. END
BEGIN NOW We can make the sauce our house special sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Get some maple syrup up in here. END

BEGIN NOW These wings are ready. END
BEGIN NOW Wow Look how nice that looks. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the chicken and waffles. END
BEGIN NOW I want to just try the wing by itself. END
BEGIN NOW Fried chicken is righteous, man. END
BEGIN NOW So, is there an appropriate way that you see I mean, I feel it's sacrilege to eat this with a fork. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna go with this. END
BEGIN NOW Kind of like double-fisting it. Yes. END
BEGIN NOW The waffle's dynamite nice and crisp. END
BEGIN NOW Get the buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW You get the little sour coming through that. END
BEGIN NOW The fried chicken is sweet, crispy, spicy I mean, just all the components of it. END
BEGIN NOW And then the syrup I mean, that's just what pushes it over the top. END
BEGIN NOW ! I'm glad you like it. END
BEGIN NOW It is delish It's really crunchy, and that's why I like it. END
BEGIN NOW I love hot sauce and maple syrup. END
BEGIN NOW It's one of my favorite things. END

BEGIN NOW And now that the waffle's down, we're gonna start preparing everything else. END
BEGIN NOW We got some turkey right here. Got it. END
BEGIN NOW This is probably one of the weirdest waffles I've ever seen, but I am going to steal this. END

BEGIN NOW Just this press, yep. You have to do by hand. END
BEGIN NOW Just put it there. END
BEGIN NOW Just press a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Do it again because it's not equal. END

BEGIN NOW They are. They're great. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] This is the taco spot. END
BEGIN NOW I'm done. My job here is done. END
BEGIN NOW Coming up, we're headed to the marina END
BEGIN NOW Light it up. for the perfect front-row seat to the freshest catch of the day. END
BEGIN NOW Real typical dish you see in Mexico all the time. END
BEGIN NOW So, if you've ever been to Cabo San Lucas before, this looks familiar. END
BEGIN NOW It's the marina. All kinds of shops, all kinds of restaurants. END
BEGIN NOW This is where you go fishing from. END
BEGIN NOW Now, the place that I'm taking you to, I've been there before. END
BEGIN NOW If you're looking for some real-deal food and a great view, you got to check out Solomon's Landing. END
BEGIN NOW You'll love the food, you'll love the atmosphere, everything about the place. END
BEGIN NOW Spectacular views, very romantic. END
BEGIN NOW And the food, well, as you can see, is to die for. END
BEGIN NOW And you can thank owner Brian Solomon for that, a California ex-pat who ditched the corporate life to buy this former taco stand back in '95. END
BEGIN NOW Over the years, Brian's transformed the taquería into a laid-back, outdoor oasis. END
BEGIN NOW He goes all out. He just caters to his customers. END
BEGIN NOW And he really wins them over with this fresh catch. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffed fish. Straight out of San Lucas Bay. END
BEGIN NOW Tantalizes the taste buds. END
BEGIN NOW So, what are we gonna make? END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna make the lobster sauce. END
BEGIN NOW So, we got everything mirepoix, shrimp shells, lobster shells, lobster claws, you name it. END
BEGIN NOW It's all in here. END
BEGIN NOW Got it. END
BEGIN NOW So, that's been roasted off. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna put some butter into there. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna put a little brandy in here. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW Flour there. END
BEGIN NOW And we're just gonna cook it down a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Now the water. END
BEGIN NOW How long are we gonna let this cook down for? END
BEGIN NOW Probably about 20 minute Add a little roux to there to thicken it up a little bit more. END
BEGIN NOW Shrimp base to give it a little bit more depth. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of tomato puree to give it some color. END
BEGIN NOW Reduce this down. END
BEGIN NOW Strain it off. END
BEGIN NOW So, now we have the lobster reduction done. END
BEGIN NOW Did you catch the fish? END
BEGIN NOW Actually, I did not, but he was a happy camper yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW So this is that fresh? END
BEGIN NOW Really? END
BEGIN NOW This is actually what they call a true red snapper. END
BEGIN NOW In Spanish, they call huachinango. END
BEGIN NOW There's the filets. END
BEGIN NOW Basically, you dip it in whole-e batter. END
BEGIN NOW Panko it. END
BEGIN NOW Then put it in clarified butter on the grill. END
BEGIN NOW Char them up on the grill. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna make the finishing sauce that's gonna go on top of the fish. Correct. END
BEGIN NOW A little olive oil, a little garlic. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna add tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and some white wine. END
BEGIN NOW Real typical dish you see in Mexico all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add the lobster sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Marinara. And heavy cream. END
BEGIN NOW So, let this reduce down a little bit, and then this will go on top of the fish. END
BEGIN NOW Plate it up. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Cilantro risotto. END
BEGIN NOW Another piece. END
BEGIN NOW And now the little sucker that brings it all to life. END
BEGIN NOW And there. We're ready to eat. END
BEGIN NOW First, I got to say, you could put the lobster sauce on a flip-flop and it would taste good. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, literally. END
BEGIN NOW The risotto, with that cilantro is nice, bright, fresh, clean flavor. END
BEGIN NOW The richness of the lobster is outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW Good one. Really nice. Excellent. Thank you very much. END
BEGIN NOW Your delicious stuffed fish. END
BEGIN NOW It's always flaky. I know it's fresh. END
BEGIN NOW We get the freshest seafood here. END
BEGIN NOW It's three or four hours from ocean to plate. END
BEGIN NOW And you just can't beat watching the sun rise while chowing down on this classic Mexican breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW A dish of chilaqles. END
BEGIN NOW If you want real chilaquiles, this is the place to come? Yes. END
BEGIN NOW All right, Chef, now, what are we into? END
BEGIN NOW We're making the red sauce with chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW stewed-down tomatoes, onions, peppers, garlic? END
BEGIN NOW Uh-huh. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. That's it. END
BEGIN NOW Put some olive oil in there. END
BEGIN NOW Almost get to where it's smoking. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna actually scorch it in the very beginning. END
BEGIN NOW The first part goes in there. END
BEGIN NOW Really want to have that scorched flavor. END
BEGIN NOW A little pan juice in there. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add a little bit of chicken base and salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Let that cook down just a little bit longer, and then I'm gonna add the tomato sauce in there to give it some color. END
BEGIN NOW What's next? What we're gonna do is take a sauté pan. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna pour the sauce we just made into there. END
BEGIN NOW Boiled chicken. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add the cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW In with the tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW Fried tortilla chips. END
BEGIN NOW Nice, big, thick tortillas. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're going to start plating. END
BEGIN NOW This is fresh cheese actually made here in the Baja they call farmer's cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Take a little heat off the palate. END
BEGIN NOW Red onions, and then some sour cream, and a sprig of cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW Sprig? That's like a garden. END
BEGIN NOW Now, I have had a lot of chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW You want them to get a little bit soggy but still have texture in the tortilla. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of heat in that. END
BEGIN NOW The texture's great, the flavor's great, the spice isn't too much. END
BEGIN NOW A little sour cream, a little farmer's cheese in there. END
BEGIN NOW You'll get a dip the guacamole. END
BEGIN NOW What I love about it, Chef, is just all the little component that you take that extra step with, and it really makes a real deal. END
BEGIN NOW Awesome. Outstanding, man. END
BEGIN NOW Best chilaquiles I ever tasted, not even at home. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, Mom. END
BEGIN NOW When we come back, Chef has got a hangover delight. END
BEGIN NOW Killer stuffed French toast. See you in a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Triple D in Cabo San Lucas. END

BEGIN NOW Triple D going international, across the border, Cabo San Lucas. END
BEGIN NOW And we're hanging out at Solomon's Landing. END
BEGIN NOW Now, we have tried fantastic chilaquiles. END
BEGIN NOW We've also tried what they call a stuffed fish. END
BEGIN NOW This, this is supposed to be, from what I've heard from everybody around here, the hangover cure of all time. END
BEGIN NOW Stuffed French toast. END
BEGIN NOW After some tough nights in Cabo, it'll help you a little bit with our hangover. END
BEGIN NOW What are we into? END
BEGIN NOW This is the compote for the stuffed French toast. END
BEGIN NOW Starting out with a little whole butter, fresh strawberries, bananas. END
BEGIN NOW Raw sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Frozen strawberry compote. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add >>little brandy to really bind these flavors really good. END
BEGIN NOW Next up? END
BEGIN NOW A nice, big pullman loaf. END
BEGIN NOW You bake it? END
BEGIN NOW We have a bakery that bakes it for us. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We're just gonna slice a couple pieces off of here. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're going to put some cream cheese on both sides so we can stuff it. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna stuff it with the fresh strawberries. END
BEGIN NOW We try to use a local product. END
BEGIN NOW A lot of the year, we're able to get local-gro strawberries. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna go in for some bananas. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna push it together. END
BEGIN NOW Let's hit it, brother. END
BEGIN NOW Now, what's in our batter over here? END
BEGIN NOW Eggs, milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream? END
BEGIN NOW And brandy. END
BEGIN NOW Compote with the brand Beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a huge breakfast fan, but I do appreciate good French toast. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of sweet, a lot of fruit. END
BEGIN NOW Some banana. END
BEGIN NOW Really nice. END
BEGIN NOW No need for any syrup. END
BEGIN NOW The juice from the compote itself is just great. END
BEGIN NOW Can't beat it. Well, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Can't beat it. Delicious. END
BEGIN NOW It's unbelievable. END
BEGIN NOW I tell them we can never make it at home. END
BEGIN NOW Good food, good price, good people. END
BEGIN NOW I love this place. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job, Chef. Well done. Thank you very much. END
BEGIN NOW Up next END
BEGIN NOW I'm picking up what you're laying down. END
BEGIN NOW the sushi spot. I like where that starts. END
BEGIN NOW rocking out the deep-fried fusion flavors. END
BEGIN NOW So, on my final leg of this Triple D tour of Cabo San Lucas, I found myself back at the marina, not too far from Solomon's Landing. END
BEGIN NOW I'm here to check out a joint that my buddy Gorilla You remember Gorilla Rich from Gorilla Barbeque in Pacifica He says he's been to this place a bunch of times. END
BEGIN NOW It's off the hook. This is Tiki Bar. END
BEGIN NOW Fish tacos are ready. END
BEGIN NOW This is our local spot to come to. END
BEGIN NOW It's in kind of a touristy area. END
BEGIN NOW Locals and tourists, we mix and mingle well. END
BEGIN NOW It's right here on the marina. I love the food, everything. END
BEGIN NOW Just the kind of place owner Moises Gonzalez was looking for after he became a local in 2005. END
BEGIN NOW A place for people to come in, hang out. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't find a place like home in Cali. END
BEGIN NOW Really? END
BEGIN NOW And to make it feel more like home for the locals, chef Manuel Aradando is taking advantage of the surroundings. END
BEGIN NOW I know it's fresh 'cause if I didn't catch it, my friends did. END
BEGIN NOW So, fresh fish all the time, every day? END
BEGIN NOW Every day. END
BEGIN NOW The sushi is excellent here. END
BEGIN NOW That's right sushi in a Mexican joint. END
BEGIN NOW It's fresh. You can't fake that. END
BEGIN NOW the classic rolls like the rainbow and spider to the turducken of sushi. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy Nagasaki. END
BEGIN NOW Layers of fresh fish inside a butterflied shrimp roll drizzled with homemade eel sauce. END
BEGIN NOW You see it every day. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna prepare today the heavy Nagasaki. END
BEGIN NOW So, what we're gonna do is start with this surimi salad. END
BEGIN NOW And this is imitation crab. Imitation crab. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna add a little bit of mayonnaise. END
BEGIN NOW The masago. That is the END
BEGIN NOW Fish eggs. fish eggs. END
BEGIN NOW Add the togarashi. END
BEGIN NOW Japanese peppers, with a little bit of sesame seeds and orange zest. END
BEGIN NOW And last but not least, the Sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW So, then what we're gonna do is just mix it up a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW Try it. END
BEGIN NOW I like where that starts. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know why you got to do anything else to it. END
BEGIN NOW This tastes great. [laughs] We're gonna take our Pacific blue shrimp. END
BEGIN NOW We are going to butterfly it, and then we do one more. END
BEGIN NOW So once and then twice? That's correct. END
BEGIN NOW Then we're gonna go ahead and do our salad. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Next, we're gonna do a piece of salmon. END
BEGIN NOW That guy's a surgeon. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. END
BEGIN NOW [speaking indistinctly] Then we fold it, and we wrap it in nori, the seaweed. END
BEGIN NOW I'm picking up what you're laying down. END
BEGIN NOW These are beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW Then our tempura, and then bread crumbs. END
BEGIN NOW Fold it in tempura like this. END
BEGIN NOW Then the bread. END
BEGIN NOW All good to go. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW So, the next thing, we're gonna fry. END
BEGIN NOW And we're gonna serve it with the eel sauce. END
BEGIN NOW A little rose. Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW Mango sauce. END
BEGIN NOW And then more eel sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Finish it off with a little red sesame seeds, and we have some microgreens. END
BEGIN NOW Gorgeous plate. END
BEGIN NOW  Okay. END
BEGIN NOW The way you treat the shrimp and the tenderness of that shrimp is outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous. END
BEGIN NOW Although it was fried, it doesn't have a real heavy fried taste to it. END
BEGIN NOW It's very light. END
BEGIN NOW The salad has just enough of the Sriracha. END
BEGIN NOW A little hint of the salmon. END
BEGIN NOW This is outstanding. Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Heavy Nagasaki up. END
BEGIN NOW Super-crispy and really delicious. END
BEGIN NOW We're at the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula where the fishing is the greatest in the world So it's the freshest in town. END
BEGIN NOW I love this restaurant. I come here every day, ever since he's had it. END
BEGIN NOW Just bring people here. It's a wonderful spot. END
BEGIN NOW I'm just like you guys. I mean, you go somewhere, you're like, Where should I go eat? A funky little place small and these guys do it legit. END
BEGIN NOW We got to do more sushi on Triple D. So, that's it for this edition of the Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Cabo tour. END
BEGIN NOW Now, before you leave, there's one joint you got to check out. END
BEGIN NOW It's not about the food. It's all about the rock. END
BEGIN NOW This is the Cabo Wabo Cantina. END
BEGIN NOW Rock music playing I hope Sammy's in the house. END
BEGIN NOW 00 Yeah! Sammy Hagar! END
BEGIN NOW Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, we in Cabo, baby! Whoo! END
BEGIN NOW [laughter] Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, all of them. END
BEGIN NOW Triple D. Cabo. Yes! END
BEGIN NOW There's your outtakes. END
BEGIN NOW [laughter], applause The local diner is an American tradition, but one by one, they're disappearing off the map. END
BEGIN NOW It is so hard to keep up. END
BEGIN NOW Located between Detroit and Toledo on Lake Erie, Monroe, Michigan, is one of the oldest towns in the state. END
BEGIN NOW Named after President James Monroe, this is General Custer's childhood home. END
BEGIN NOW And a walk down main street Monroe is proof that this a textbook all-American town, complete with its ow hometown diner Dena's. END
BEGIN NOW I don't go to any other diners in town. END
BEGIN NOW don't want to mention any other names, but I prefer my Dena's. END
BEGIN NOW It feels just like home. END
BEGIN NOW You could get breakfast anywhere, but you cannot get the love that pours out in that restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW It's just a fascinating place to come, not only for the food, but the way that Dena makes people feel. END
BEGIN NOW She's head and shoulders above everybody else in Monroe. END
BEGIN NOW That's just the way I feel about it. END
BEGIN NOW Originally opening as Al's Diner back in the '50s, Dena Voukides is the current owner of Monroe's favorite diner. END
BEGIN NOW When Dena immigrated here from Greece through the former owner recognized Dena's passion and gave her the diner for next to nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Since I was 13 years old, I've always dreamed of havin my own business. END
BEGIN NOW I learned how to take an order from the restaurant before I learned to speak English. END
BEGIN NOW You know, being an outsider from Monroe, they make me feel like I'm one of their families. END
BEGIN NOW give you a ride home, okay? END
BEGIN NOW To me, Dena represents the essence of community. END
BEGIN NOW Living by the motto Where friends are family, Dena has continually opened her doors to the neediest in Monroe, holding fundraisers and donating resources for families who have fallen on hard times. END
BEGIN NOW You know, with us working with the homeless, Dena's always feeding the homeless, she's always sending us stuff. END
BEGIN NOW She just gives from the bottom of her heart. END
BEGIN NOW I have established some really beautiful relationships with a lot of people here. END
BEGIN NOW I feel that a lot in my life because my actual family's not here. END
BEGIN NOW Voice breaking And, uh, a lot of people here have filled their void in my life. END
BEGIN NOW And I think that's what keeps me moving and pushing as much as I can because not only I don't want to disappoint myself, but most of all, I don't want to disappoint them. END
BEGIN NOW Dena has always paid for was the kindness to the community that the previous owner showed her. END
BEGIN NOW But it's come at the expense of the diner's bottom line. END
BEGIN NOW For the Thousand Island dressing, we grow our cucumbers, make those into into pickles. END
BEGIN NOW We make our own ketchup. END
BEGIN NOW And we put local honey in the the mayonnaise I don't even know that I'm worthy to eat this. END
BEGIN NOW They should have a shot of that in the Louvre. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] [laughs] have anything to say. but I don't what's better on all of this. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna hit the Thousand Island. END
BEGIN NOW You know this pig probably. END
BEGIN NOW We found one for two certified organic butchers in Ohio. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so this is all gonna go in the grinder. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Ice water. And the ice water because? END
BEGIN NOW It binds everything and also helps dissolve the spices. END
BEGIN NOW Ground black pepper, savory, dried thyme, marjoram. END
BEGIN NOW This is fresh sage. END
BEGIN NOW And sage and pork are like Mickey and Mouse. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Some kosher salt. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, what do you think of that? END
BEGIN NOW Well, what I want you to do is just run your fingers through my hair. END

BEGIN NOW Put scallions right on top. END
BEGIN NOW Wow! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, this is nuts. END
BEGIN NOW The sage, the meat, the scallion, the cheddar. END
BEGIN NOW I like that there's texture to the biscuit because then it becomes re fortified inside of the gravy, hitting those onions at the last moment. END
BEGIN NOW A little sharp at the end cuts through the richness. END
BEGIN NOW And you could taste the cheddar in the biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW What's that? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, he thinks this is my first rodeo? Oh, no. END

BEGIN NOW Why do you call it Yalie? END
BEGIN NOW Part of this restaurant is inspired by New Haven, Connecticut. END
BEGIN NOW Yale, New Haven. END
BEGIN NOW So we take our little neck clams, a bunch of whole garlic, lemons, and we got fresh thyme. END
BEGIN NOW A bunch of olive oil. And just let them go. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as they start popping open END
BEGIN NOW Give it a stir, pour them out, shuck the pizzas. END

BEGIN NOW All you do is take a gallon of milk, a gallon of buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Want me to give you some help with that? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, that would be good. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna chug the buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Go! Go! Go! END
BEGIN NOW Whoo-hoo! END
BEGIN NOW And the activation of the buttermilk alone is what takes care of that milk. END
BEGIN NOW You just see it starts to pull away from the whey. END
BEGIN NOW You're separating, yeah, the curd and the whey. END
BEGIN NOW You put this cheese cloth in here. END
BEGIN NOW You take this ricotta. END
BEGIN NOW Let it separate out. Grab this baby out of its water. END

BEGIN NOW Let it cool. Just like 15 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW So this pizza's called the Stanley. END

BEGIN NOW Nice and creamy and light. END
BEGIN NOW Dynamite. That's it. END
BEGIN NOW Into the oven. This should be good. END
BEGIN NOW 600 degrees on the deck. END
BEGIN NOW Cook it slowly so it melts out. END
BEGIN NOW That ricotta's nuts, man. Wow! END
BEGIN NOW All right, here we go. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END

BEGIN NOW Coming up, in Kaneohe, Hawaii END
BEGIN NOW I wonder who it is, honey. END
BEGIN NOW a crazy dude going the extra mile END
BEGIN NOW You catch your own octopus? for a real-deal taste of the islands. END
BEGIN NOW In Hawaii, this is how we do it. This is old-school style. END
BEGIN NOW I'd like to see more of the old Lady. END
BEGIN NOW I'd like to see her go back to her more you know social side. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe see if it's something that has an effect on her social side. END
BEGIN NOW She literally started changing. END
BEGIN NOW It was shocking. [laughs] The difference has been incredible. She's much more aware. END
BEGIN NOW A brighter look to her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW She loves the food. END
BEGIN NOW She wants to learn things. END
BEGIN NOW I went in as not a believer, but I am now. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. She's a good dog. END
BEGIN NOW You're getting a bit emotional there? END
BEGIN NOW me, I want more yes, more please, I want more fun, more style, I want more love, more smiles, I want more. J-e-l-l-o You know in the movie Forrest Gump when Bubba talks about shrimp and all the ways you can have it? END
BEGIN NOW That's kind of how I feel about poke. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you know, you’re talking about the cut-up fish that's seasoned so many different ways. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you can have tako poke that's octopus ahi poke, shrimp poke. END
BEGIN NOW That's why I'm here at Kaneohe. END
BEGIN NOW About 11 miles from Honolulu, this is Fresh Catch. END
BEGIN NOW Fire bowl ahi. END
BEGIN NOW Spicy salmon. END
BEGIN NOW I drive all the way from the other side of the island just to come here. END
BEGIN NOW He eats here about seven days a week. END
BEGIN NOW He got an ahi katsu. END
BEGIN NOW It's purely Hawaiian. As Hawaiian as Reno Henriques END
BEGIN NOW One smoking Hawaiian plate. END
BEGIN NOW an East Side native whose love for the poke trumped the family business. END
BEGIN NOW They're probably the biggest rubbish company in Hawaii. END
BEGIN NOW Rubbish? Pick up rubbish. END
BEGIN NOW Trash? Yeah, trashmen. END
BEGIN NOW Trading rubbish for fresh fish? Not a bad deal. END
BEGIN NOW I love to make people happy and watch the smile on everybody's faces while they eat my food. END
BEGIN NOW There's smiles all around, for the 30 different pokes coming out of the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW This is Dom Raiola. He plays for the Detroit Lions. END
BEGIN NOW Over premium steakhouses across the country, this is your go-to. This is what I was raised on. END
BEGIN NOW The regular smoked tako. END
BEGIN NOW What makes great Hawaiian food? END
BEGIN NOW I think the freshness. END
BEGIN NOW And if you want it really and I mean really fresh, sometimes you got to do the job yourself. END
BEGIN NOW We go diving, catch our own octopus. END
BEGIN NOW You catch your own octopus? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, we catch our own octopus. END
BEGIN NOW The squid will kind of be in the hole, hiding with his little hand over there. How is that? END
BEGIN NOW You got to get one of these, like one END
BEGIN NOW Like a END
BEGIN NOW Straight from the ocean and into the kitchen for this island favorite. END
BEGIN NOW Spicy tako, it's a smoked octopus. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, poke. END
BEGIN NOW One of our most popular pokes is a spicy smoked tako. END
BEGIN NOW Tako T-A-K-O. T-A-K-O is takos. END
BEGIN NOW Octopus, in Hawaii we call it he'e. I'm gonna hit you in the he'e. head Yeah, there you go. END
BEGIN NOW So that's probably about a four- to five-pounder right there. END
BEGIN NOW It's that new hairdo I was looking for. END
BEGIN NOW  Squidlocks. END
BEGIN NOW So what do you have to clean on it? END
BEGIN NOW First of all, we're just gonna cut the head. END
BEGIN NOW So we got the beak right there, so we're gonna cut his beak. END
BEGIN NOW So the next thing we're gonna do is we need to put the octopus in the bowl, and we need to put the Hawaiian salt on top. END
BEGIN NOW And then again, we're gonna use the salt to tenderize the squid and take off the slime. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, you're really working this thing out. END
BEGIN NOW So now we'll just put it in this bowl. END
BEGIN NOW I've cooked a lot of squid, and I've seen a lot of squid cooked. END
BEGIN NOW I've never seen this process. END
BEGIN NOW This is the best way 'cause he'll become the most tender. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, my man. So now we're just gonna cut it up. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. So now we're just gonna string one right through. END
BEGIN NOW Just gonna hang him like that, really? Yeah, just like this. END
BEGIN NOW Where are we going with this rod of fun? END
BEGIN NOW Right into my smoker. END
BEGIN NOW Look, someone's pullin up. I wonder who it is, honey. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so we're gonna go to the smoker. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, take a walk over to the smoker. END
BEGIN NOW We're walking our octopus. END
BEGIN NOW This is the Diablo 5,000. END
BEGIN NOW Come here. END
BEGIN NOW We have got some aluminum siding. END
BEGIN NOW I think he cut the hole in here with a hatchet. END
BEGIN NOW What was this? END
BEGIN NOW This was actually a cabinet. END
BEGIN NOW It was a cabinet, wasn't it? Yeah, it was a cabinet. END
BEGIN NOW In Hawaii, this is how we do it. This is old-school style. END
BEGIN NOW As he explains it to me, he walks around with the octopus and keeps smacking me in the legs with it. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, like that. END
BEGIN NOW Let's smoke some octopus. END
BEGIN NOW What kind of wood? END
BEGIN NOW Kiawe wood. Kiawe wood? END
BEGIN NOW It's a hardwood, so easy to use. END
BEGIN NOW We only got kiawe or guava wood in Hawaii. END
BEGIN NOW How long are we gonna smoke this? END
BEGIN NOW Four hours. END
BEGIN NOW Four hours? Don't ask me what temperature it is. END
BEGIN NOW When the skin starts to peel off of a little bit, it's just about ready. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Smoked octopus. END
BEGIN NOW It's octopus jerky. END
BEGIN NOW Tasty. END
BEGIN NOW Let's go. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Now what are we gonna do? END
BEGIN NOW Take our squid off. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Cut it up thin. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Nice and tender, almost buttery. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so now we're gonna make our sauce for our smoked tako. END
BEGIN NOW In Hawaii, we use a lot of mayonnaise on it. END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW That's like a hot tub of mayonnaise. END
BEGIN NOW Wasabi. END
BEGIN NOW And then we have our kimchi base. END
BEGIN NOW Mm-hmm-hmm! END
BEGIN NOW These are my homegrown chili peppers front my house. END
BEGIN NOW Are they hot? They're hot, man. END
BEGIN NOW Whisk them up. END
BEGIN NOW All right, bro, give it a taste. END
BEGIN NOW Rock star. All right, so we got our cut octopus. END
BEGIN NOW Dump it in a bowl. END
BEGIN NOW We got our spicy sauce right here. END
BEGIN NOW Give it a couple good mixes. END
BEGIN NOW Now, do people come in and buy this to go, eat it here? END
BEGIN NOW Well, we make poke bowls two scoops of rice in, like, a hoagie tray. END
BEGIN NOW Hoagie tray, so this is, like, hoagie poke? END
BEGIN NOW hokey-pokey Yeah, hoagie poke. END
BEGIN NOW You do a little hokey to the right, a little hokey to the left. END
BEGIN NOW A little hoagie poke. END
BEGIN NOW So we got our smoked tako in here. END
BEGIN NOW Garnish it with a little bit of green onions. END
BEGIN NOW And then tobiko fish and There you go, my man. Good to go. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, there you go. END
BEGIN NOW You got great texture. END
BEGIN NOW The octopus is tender, a little bit of smoke. END
BEGIN NOW Good heat in the mayonnaise. END
BEGIN NOW The tobiko on there is nice, the fresh green onion. END
BEGIN NOW It's outstanding. END
BEGIN NOW Tako poke. END
BEGIN NOW This is just delicious. END
BEGIN NOW You can taste the mesquite, or the kiawe wood, as we call it out here. END
BEGIN NOW It has a nice little flavor to it that makes it stand out. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what exactly what Reno does, but it's good stuff. END
BEGIN NOW It's perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, I'm telling you, this is, like, poke paradise. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you very much, my man. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] This guy's the bomb. END
BEGIN NOW Up next END
BEGIN NOW an old-school diner car in Gardiner, Maine END
BEGIN NOW Tile original. The counter original. END
BEGIN NOW taking an unexpected turn with the menu. END
BEGIN NOW That's duck-licious. END
BEGIN NOW Then, chef-made sandwiches in Fairhope, Alabama END
BEGIN NOW Hold me put out by the prince of panini. END
BEGIN NOW That's slamma jammain Alabama. END
BEGIN NOW ready for suspense. END
BEGIN NOW Unbridled jealousy. END
BEGIN NOW She's still there. END
BEGIN NOW New beginnings. END
BEGIN NOW Now, under its fourth owner, this local legend is serving up way more than traditional diner fare. END
BEGIN NOW Mm That's what we're looking for. END
BEGIN NOW I travel around with this spoon. END
BEGIN NOW Aw, man, this is great. END
BEGIN NOW They got all of the old favorites END
BEGIN NOW Meatloaf. END
BEGIN NOW Evidently, you didn't like it because you cleaned the whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW and some with a twist. END
BEGIN NOW Banana walnut pancakes? Banana walnut pancakes. END
BEGIN NOW Whose recipe is this? Our recipe that we've had for years. END
BEGIN NOW Let's talk about this. This, I get a kick out of. END
BEGIN NOW Here you are at the diner. END
BEGIN NOW Chili dog, mac and cheese. HH Let me have the double cheeseburger. END
BEGIN NOW I'll have some fries. But then let's step right in and get some Szechuan beef sauté. END
BEGIN NOW You can blame that on Kenneth. Kenny. Oh, geez. END
BEGIN NOW Kenneth's a Seattle transplant who drops specials like spicy Asian noodles with shrimp, lamb tagine with couscous, and chicken Marbella with prunes, green Olives, and garlic. END
BEGIN NOW There are so many interesting things. END
BEGIN NOW Now, is this your recipe? END
BEGIN NOW This is my concoction, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Your concoction? END
BEGIN NOW It's a Greek stuffed flank steak roulade. END
BEGIN NOW Aa You start with a little salt and pepper. END
BEGIN NOW It looks like you have fresh ground this pepper yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW A little garlic, spinach, and a little red pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Roasted red bells. END
BEGIN NOW We got some artichoke hearts here. END
BEGIN NOW And then some feta. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Give it a little tuck. This will go on the menu. END
BEGIN NOW Now, how long has your special been running? END
BEGIN NOW I run it until it runs out, and then I'll take a break for a couple of weeks. END
BEGIN NOW Or I'll stuff it with something else, just change it up. END
BEGIN NOW Never keep the same one constantly. END
BEGIN NOW Check that out. END
BEGIN NOW Looking good. Feta's nice. END
BEGIN NOW I'm totally down with that. That's gonna be a hit. END
BEGIN NOW Nice balance. Cooked perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW That's bananas.! END
BEGIN NOW Bananas is good. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] The roulade and all the wild new dishes have been a big hit with the locals who have been coming to the A1 for 60 years. END
BEGIN NOW Hi, how are you? How are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Mike Giberson's the fourth owner. END
BEGIN NOW His dad was number 3. END
BEGIN NOW And the place itself, known as Heald's Diner when it was first opened back in '46, really is a local legend, set up on 30-foot stilts next to the bridge over the Cobbosseecont Stream right in the middle of town. END
BEGIN NOW The tile original. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Yep. END
BEGIN NOW The counter original. END
BEGIN NOW The counter original. The booths original. END
BEGIN NOW ah, the booths original. All mahogany. END
BEGIN NOW Where do you find the little letters? END
BEGIN NOW We can still buy those white letters, but I can no longer buy the red letters. END
BEGIN NOW Those red letters are precious to me. END
BEGIN NOW And so is Mike's goal of keeping the customers happy. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, wow. END
BEGIN NOW It's really good food, and you get to try different things. END
BEGIN NOW When you sit down and have some END
BEGIN NOW Leek strudel. leek strudel, which you don't find every menu, in case you didn't know. END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe some duck, topped with Kenneth's mojito glaze. END
BEGIN NOW Rum. Harrison: rum. END
BEGIN NOW Brown sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Brown sugar. END
BEGIN NOW When those cook down a little bit, you go ahead and add in the mint. END
BEGIN NOW I actually keep sugar on the side with mint in it specifically for this purpose. END
BEGIN NOW The oils are extracted into the sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Now, how long did you let that mint and that sugar hang out. END
BEGIN NOW I let it sit around for about two weeks, three weeks. END
BEGIN NOW Really? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW You're putting it on! I try and do something nice. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, it's more than nice. END
BEGIN NOW That's duck-licious. END
BEGIN NOW Nice job, brother. END
BEGIN NOW But don't think this classic diner's ignoring the diner classics. END
BEGIN NOW Root beer and duck, you can only do that at the diner. END
BEGIN NOW We've met tons of people and made great friends, and it's our life, so why not make it fun? END
BEGIN NOW When you think fast food, you think American, right? END
BEGIN NOW You know, burgers, fries, the speaker box, the whole giddy up, but really, there's fast food all over the world. END
BEGIN NOW And here in Fairhope, Alabama, there's a that's decided to his his fast food with a European spin. END
BEGIN NOW You got to meet Panini Pete. END
BEGIN NOW Turkey, tuna, two more rosemarys. END
BEGIN NOW A classically trained chef. Here we go. END
BEGIN NOW cranking out those pressed Italian-style sandwiches called panini. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna paninan-ize this. END
BEGIN NOW It's really good. END
BEGIN NOW And fast enough for the tightest lunches. END
BEGIN NOW You can get lunch and eat it and be back at work. END
BEGIN NOW Order up! It's fast and yet END
BEGIN NOW It's not fast food. END
BEGIN NOW Our dressings are made from scratch, the aioli END
BEGIN NOW You're making your own? END
BEGIN NOW Right. Wow. END
BEGIN NOW Pete's a first-class chef. END
BEGIN NOW This is the raw curd? Correct. END
BEGIN NOW He's even doing his own mozzarella with fresh curd brought in from Wisconsin. END
BEGIN NOW You're coddling it gently. END
BEGIN NOW The less milk and cream you squeeze out of there, the creamier the final product's going to be. END
BEGIN NOW Do it! Do it! END
BEGIN NOW Yeah! END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW We could play this game all day! END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna do the portion basket. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my God! END
BEGIN NOW This that good or what? Hold me. END
BEGIN NOW Stack it with basil, fresh tomato, and a homemade balsamic vinaigrette, and you've got Italian caprese panini END
BEGIN NOW A mozzarella tomato. END
BEGIN NOW And get his one with mozz, red pepper, and turkey. END
BEGIN NOW I go with the turkey every time. END
BEGIN NOW You know the mozz is fresh, the peppers are fresh-roasted, and so is the turkey, starting with Pete's special herb rub. END
BEGIN NOW A little bit of rosemary, sage, salt, pepper, garlic. END
BEGIN NOW Now we got to do the mons here. END
BEGIN NOW I think we're good. END
BEGIN NOW Wow, that's nice. Whoo! END
BEGIN NOW A chef like you, I would be thinking bone-in for sure. END
BEGIN NOW When you get to the method, you'll understand the cooking method. You know what? END
BEGIN NOW I didn't even know why I opened up my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW My brother-in-law taught me this one. END
BEGIN NOW Triple wrap. Called an almost-fried turkey. END
BEGIN NOW That's how we roll. That's my line. END
BEGIN NOW Now why fry it, versus bake it? END
BEGIN NOW The same temperature 375 in the end. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's shorter cook time, it's really convenient, and really creates a good product. END
BEGIN NOW You'll see. END
BEGIN NOW You want to slice some of this up, take it for a ride? END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW What a great blend of those spices. END
BEGIN NOW That might be the most tender, moist turkey I have ever tried. END
BEGIN NOW All right, let's make a sandwich. END
BEGIN NOW We start off with a little focaccia. So it comes in, raw dough. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. Dijon. END
BEGIN NOW Some of our homemade aioli on top. END
BEGIN NOW Most people would just fancy up a little mayonnaise. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir. Not here. END
BEGIN NOW Some of our turkey. END
BEGIN NOW A healthy portion. END
BEGIN NOW Some roasted peppers. END
BEGIN NOW A little pepper, fresh-cracked pepper, kosher salt. END
BEGIN NOW Hit it with some baby greens. END
BEGIN NOW Homemade balsamic vinaigrette. END
BEGIN NOW Mozzarella. Remember your best buddy? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, I should try that before you put it on there. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, you better test that. END
BEGIN NOW A little butter and olive oil just to help keep it from sticking and give it a nice color. END
BEGIN NOW Right in the basket. You better hold one for me. END
BEGIN NOW Mm. END
BEGIN NOW I got to tell you, you start with the bread nice, light, good crunch. END
BEGIN NOW Move right into that mozzarella. END
BEGIN NOW The greens, the balsamic pops. END
BEGIN NOW Everything worked together, but nothing overpowers another. END
BEGIN NOW That's slamma jamma in Alabama. END
BEGIN NOW Dude! END
BEGIN NOW Food is really fresh. The people are really nice. END
BEGIN NOW All right, y'all enjoy everything. END
BEGIN NOW It feels like it's really been tenderly cared for specifically for you. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you know he is the prince of panini. END
BEGIN NOW Woman [laughs] Obviously, yes. He is very good at what he does. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that right, Pete? END
BEGIN NOW I am the prince of panini END
BEGIN NOW says you. END
BEGIN NOW Says me. END
BEGIN NOW Up next END
BEGIN NOW a Chinese-Mexican mash-up in Phoenix END
BEGIN NOW The unity, the bonding! END
BEGIN NOW cruising for the ultimate combo. END
BEGIN NOW I am just in awe. END
BEGIN NOW Then, a taste of Haiti in Miami Beach END
BEGIN NOW Ah, man. Wow! END
BEGIN NOW that's making a heck of an impression. END
BEGIN NOW You have got to come try this fish. END
BEGIN NOW flavors, colors, sweeteners, preservatives, and no artificial smiles. END
BEGIN NOW When I opened Tex Wasabi's Southern-style Barbecue and Sushi Restaurant, people thought I was crazy. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's nice to come down to Phoenix, Arizona, and find out that there's another group that's off the hook and out of bounds serving Chinese and Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome to Chino Bandido. END
BEGIN NOW It's bizarre, but it's good. Order up! Egg foo young! END
BEGIN NOW ERI: You should call this egg foo fun. It is very unusual, but that's why we like it. END
BEGIN NOW Chinese food in a quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW That's awesome. The unity, the bonding! END
BEGIN NOW Love it. END
BEGIN NOW You won't find another place like it. END
BEGIN NOW It comes from the culture of the family that owns it. END
BEGIN NOW One of each? That'd be Arizona natives Eve and Frank Collins END
BEGIN NOW Hi, sir. How are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW who opened this place 17 years ago. END
BEGIN NOW FRANK: Before we opened it, we sat up in bad, and she said, What are we gonna serve? And I said, Well, we'll serve what we eat at home. That meant the Mexican food that's so big in Arizona END
BEGIN NOW Honey, quesadilla. Okay, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW the Chinese food Eve grew up with. END
BEGIN NOW EVE: The Chinese barbecue comes from my mom and dad. END
BEGIN NOW and the Caribbean foods some friends turned them on to. END
BEGIN NOW It's jerk chicken, named after a yet-unknown customer. END
BEGIN NOW It's delicious. It's amazing. END
BEGIN NOW And then they put it all together. END
BEGIN NOW The combination is rice and beans and any two of these numbers. END
BEGIN NOW Put just the number, it's a pile on a plate. END
BEGIN NOW B is burrito, Q is quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW Mark your bean black or refried. END
BEGIN NOW Mark your rice. END
BEGIN NOW They're white, jerk-fried, pork-fried, plain-fried, and chicken-fried. END
BEGIN NOW Let's say you like number 1 and you like number 7. END
BEGIN NOW Anybody doesn't understand? END
BEGIN NOW Double jerked-chicken combo, one in a quesadilla with black beans and jerk-fried rice. END
BEGIN NOW There wasn't even a hesitation. And there's something for everybody. END
BEGIN NOW I'm having J-bread chicken with rice. A J-bread quesilla. END
BEGIN NOW It's a little sweet, and it's got a nice spicy kick to it. END
BEGIN NOW What are we making? END
BEGIN NOW Red sauce for J-Bread chicken. END
BEGIN NOW I get sesame oil, some red chili oil because of the color. END
BEGIN NOW What else is there? There's a secret oil. END
BEGIN NOW You gonna tell me? No. END
BEGIN NOW Tomato sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Right into the oil. END
BEGIN NOW Are you serious? END
BEGIN NOW We fry it. END
BEGIN NOW Do you see this? END
BEGIN NOW Then we put the garlic in. END
BEGIN NOW The oil into END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW It forms a glaze. END
BEGIN NOW It looks like a ketchup hot tub in Flavortown. END
BEGIN NOW It is. END
BEGIN NOW This is sugar. END
BEGIN NOW Powdered sugar? Powdered sugar. END
BEGIN NOW You let that boil, pop the green onions in. END
BEGIN NOW I am just in awe. END
BEGIN NOW And that'll boil down. END
BEGIN NOW [whistles] So we have thigh meat, egg whites, corn starch. END
BEGIN NOW Does this help keep the corn starch off the so it doesn't get so dense? Yep. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! I'm excited. END
BEGIN NOW A little garlic salt. END
BEGIN NOW And you put it in there, versus in the corn starch? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, so it will be nice and white. END
BEGIN NOW You will see this on Guy's Big Bite. It has to be pure corn starch. END
BEGIN NOW Pure? No flour? Not a derivative. END
BEGIN NOW Shake it up. Ooh! END
BEGIN NOW Hop it over here and drop it in. END
BEGIN NOW It's the volumizing of the egg whites. Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that pretty? END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so now we get the sauce remade. END
BEGIN NOW When it's boing hot, we're gonna take this chicken. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna wear, like, a jumpsuit next time. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW You only look like you've done that 900,000 times. END
BEGIN NOW That's your red chicken. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! That's gonna be hot. END
BEGIN NOW It's very hot. END
BEGIN NOW Or like Ryder would say, Num, num, num. It's glazed. It's hot. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! That's awesome! END
BEGIN NOW However you get it with rice, in a burrito, or a quesadilla. END
BEGIN NOW It's so good, with all the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Were you always in the restaurant business? END
BEGIN NOW No. [laughs] I burned rice until I was 20. END
BEGIN NOW But nothing's burning now. END
BEGIN NOW ese quesadillas are to die for. END
BEGIN NOW The fusion of the Mexican, Chinese food works well together. END
BEGIN NOW I have a little machaca here. It's delicately spiced. END
BEGIN NOW It's Mexican shredded beef, but look how they're doing it. END
BEGIN NOW This is where the Chinese style comes in. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. It cooks over high heat. END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW And then you're doing it quickly. END
BEGIN NOW It gets served in quesadillas, in burritos, and with Chinese fried rice. END
BEGIN NOW Look what I happen to have, a random fork. END
BEGIN NOW Getting a little bit of everybody in there. END
BEGIN NOW Great texture of the meat, big garlic, dynamite. END
BEGIN NOW Now you know why I come here every time we're in town. END
BEGIN NOW We're hooked on the food. All you got to do is try the food one time, and that'll sell you. END
BEGIN NOW Does it say body by chinos? It does. END
BEGIN NOW I made it. END
BEGIN NOW Loyal. Very loyal. END
BEGIN NOW This is just hands-down I have been looking so forward to coming here. END
BEGIN NOW It's remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW It's probably one of the neatest places that we've shot on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Ah, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Every year, BBI come down to Miami for the South Beach Food and Wine Fest, I've cruised by this joint right here. END
BEGIN NOW It's called Tap Tap. END
BEGIN NOW And I'd say, Tap Tap? What is it? Maybe a tapas restaurant? END
BEGIN NOW Tap Tap No, a dinner/dance joint. END
BEGIN NOW Tap Tap maybe it's beers from around the world. But then I hear that it's the rockin' Haitian food, so you know I just got to stop and check it out. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, hello. Grilled conch. END
BEGIN NOW When I have it here, it always reminds me of Hai. END
BEGIN NOW I have never had Haitian food. END
BEGIN NOW You don't have to travel to Haiti to get it. Come to Tap Tap. END
BEGIN NOW The art and the food, it is just like home. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Fish and shrimp and oxtail. END
BEGIN NOW Grilled goat. It's really wonderful. END
BEGIN NOW What inspired you to open Tap Tap? END
BEGIN NOW The Haitian people and the great food That owner Katherine Kean END
BEGIN NOW All right, guys. END
BEGIN NOW fell in love with when she lived there as a filmmaker. END
BEGIN NOW So, 15 years ago, she opened this joint END
BEGIN NOW Pickup! END
BEGIN NOW and hired Haitian-raised Gary Sanon-Jules. END
BEGIN NOW He used to work as a bus boy. We're doing all right? END
BEGIN NOW Now he's running the place and serving up Haitian classics. END
BEGIN NOW You guys keep enjoying the meal All of the recipes from the different parts of the country are reflected here. END
BEGIN NOW Like this one. Poisson gros sel. END
BEGIN NOW a Central Haitian fish classic served poached, grilled, or fried. END
BEGIN NOW The yellowtail, the way that they prepared it, so flavorful. END
BEGIN NOW So we have a base marinade olive oil, vinegar, bouillabaisse, mustard, shallots garlic, onions. END
BEGIN NOW Start adding in the red pepper, Scotch bonnet peppers, scallions, parsley, fresh pepper. END
BEGIN NOW Thyme, lime juice, and salt. END
BEGIN NOW Our snapper has been cleaned and marinated. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna make the broth that we're cooking today. That's correct. END
BEGIN NOW So we start with the celery. END
BEGIN NOW Red pepper in there. END
BEGIN NOW Some scallions, some onion Onion! END
BEGIN NOW Scotch bonnet pepper. END
BEGIN NOW We'll throw a block of butter in there. END
BEGIN NOW A block? A block, baby. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh-squeezed lime juice. END
BEGIN NOW A little olive oil. Put a little salt in there. END
BEGIN NOW It's gonna come to a boil. END
BEGIN NOW We have our yellowtail snapper here. Boil/poach. END
BEGIN NOW So that's got to be in there for 8 to 10 minutes. END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna make the Scotch bonnet lime sauce. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, that doesn't scare me. END
BEGIN NOW No, don't worry. Scotch bonnet. END
BEGIN NOW Some oil, garlic, some onions. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Red bell peppers. END
BEGIN NOW Squeeze some lime in there, some butter. END
BEGIN NOW Now we'll take some water from the stock. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you are grabbing a Scotch bonnet. END
BEGIN NOW I'm getting nervous. You're not gonna get heat from it because we didn't puncture the Scotch bonnet pepper. END
BEGIN NOW You do get a little bit of the flavor, but none of the heat until you open that up, if that's what you want, but we leave that up to the customer. A little bit of salt. END
BEGIN NOW Fish is done tub in the hot tub, sauna. END
BEGIN NOW And now we're gonna take our Scotch bonnet lime sauce, and then we'll just top the fish with it. END
BEGIN NOW Looks beautiful. Really, it got a lot of colors to it. END
BEGIN NOW A little lime. Just go ahead and squeeze it right on. END
BEGIN NOW Where do you like to start eating at? END
BEGIN NOW I like the knee. I like the elbow. END
BEGIN NOW Submerge it in a little sauce! END
BEGIN NOW Ah, man. Wow! END
BEGIN NOW I credit you for it having massive flavor. END
BEGIN NOW The fish is unbelievably tender. END
BEGIN NOW The sauce that goes along with it It almost has a French influence to it. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, absolutely! END
BEGIN NOW I want to eat it all! END
BEGIN NOW Listen to me right now. END
BEGIN NOW You have got to come try this fish, even if you don't like fish. END
BEGIN NOW It is so legit. END
BEGIN NOW It's too legit to fish. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] To die for. END
BEGIN NOW This is really, really good. Enjoy it? END
BEGIN NOW Tap Tap is an icon. END
BEGIN NOW Grilled goat. It's fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW Original. It's beautiful. I'm moving in. END
BEGIN NOW Earlier, I was just gonna come and stay for a while. END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm moving in. Oh, beautiful. Well, welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Can I put my stuff up there? END
BEGIN NOW So that's it for this road trip. END
BEGIN NOW But don't worry. END

BEGIN NOW Just like mom couldn't make. END
BEGIN NOW Just like mama couldn't make! END
BEGIN NOW Then we're headin' north END
BEGIN NOW It's cold out here. END
BEGIN NOW for biscuits and gravy in Oregon END
BEGIN NOW I could be eatin' a paper towel with that gravy on it. Wow. END
BEGIN NOW N'awlins in Indiana END
BEGIN NOW Once you cross over the threshold here, you're in Louisiana. END
BEGIN NOW and good old gizzards yeah, gizzards in Michigan. END
BEGIN NOW This place is a trip. END
BEGIN NOW So, get ready for a down-home, down-South food-coma kind of show. END
BEGIN NOW This is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW you know, on Triple D, we've hit joints that are all about pizza, all about burgers. END
BEGIN NOW We've even hit a joint that's all about fried carp. END
BEGIN NOW And today, ladies and gentlemen, we take another culinary leap to visit a joint that's all about the tender, flaky Is the anticipation killing you, or what? END
BEGIN NOW The tender, flaky, gravy-topped Southern delicacy known as biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome to Portland's Pine State Biscuits END
BEGIN NOW Full tray comin' up. END
BEGIN NOW The best biscuit ever. END
BEGIN NOW About three minutes on biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW This is the perfect bite. END
BEGIN NOW Biscuit and huckleberry jam. END
BEGIN NOW And a biscuit with sausage gravy. END
BEGIN NOW Do you run here? END
BEGIN NOW Some good home-cooked comfort food. END
BEGIN NOW I got some gravy comin'. END
BEGIN NOW all served up by college buddies Brian Snyder, Walt Alexander, and Kevin Atchley END
BEGIN NOW Hot tray. We're all from North Carolina. END
BEGIN NOW All of you? Yep. How y'all doin'? END
BEGIN NOW who ended up in Portland, reconnected, and opened this place. END
BEGIN NOW Why biscuits? 'Cause we missed 'em. END
BEGIN NOW People need a place they could stop by and get a good, hearty breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW Like this North Carolina classic. END
BEGIN NOW The best biscuits and gravy. END
BEGIN NOW So get me started. END
BEGIN NOW Flour. All-purpose? END
BEGIN NOW Unbleached. Baking powder. Baking soda. END
BEGIN NOW Why the two? That's what gives us the best rise, flakiness. END
BEGIN NOW Little bit of salt. And we whisk this together. END
BEGIN NOW Put the dry ingredients together first. END
BEGIN NOW Then we got the wet mix. Buttermilk. END
BEGIN NOW Is that buttermilk light? END
BEGIN NOW Reduced fat. END
BEGIN NOW We got some full-fat yogurt. Some eggs. END
BEGIN NOW We'll whisk all this together, and then we shred the butter. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. We're gonna what? Oh, this is awesome. END
BEGIN NOW Dude, I have seen biscuits all over the world, and I have never seen butter shredding. END
BEGIN NOW It's rock-hard frozen. Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW It's gonna create flaked deliciousness. END
BEGIN NOW You two it. END
BEGIN NOW Check that out. That's nuts. Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Actually, it's butter. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna do our vaca frita for our Chimi. END
BEGIN NOW Vaca frita! Vaca frita. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna start off with our chopped onions. END
BEGIN NOW So, we got the green peppers, whole garlics, and then our bay leaf. END
BEGIN NOW This is USDA choice flank steak. END
BEGIN NOW Just gonna cook it down. END
BEGIN NOW While that's working, we're gonna make the mojo? END
BEGIN NOW Correct. Classic mojo marinade. END
BEGIN NOW Sliced onions. Naranja ria. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. Sour orange, baby. Sour orange. END
BEGIN NOW Chopped garlic. END
BEGIN NOW  A little bit of salt. END
BEGIN NOW We're just gonna let this kind of marry together. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is the vaca frita. END
BEGIN NOW This is the flank steak that's cooked down. END
BEGIN NOW I should probably just try this for, like Yeah, just a test? Oh! END
BEGIN NOW So, what we do is shred it by hand. END
BEGIN NOW In the ropa vieja style. END
BEGIN NOW Exactly, and removing all the little connective tissue that you have. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever you say. [chuckles] Once it's all shredded, we'll go ahead and take our mojo, pour it over the top. END
BEGIN NOW All right, let's do this. END
BEGIN NOW [sizzling] Exact translation of vaca frita fried cow so you got to get it nice and crispy. END
BEGIN NOW While that's going, we'll take the tortilla, throw it on the flattop, give it a nice little warm-up. END
BEGIN NOW That's it? Voilà. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so we got our three-cheese blend. END
BEGIN NOW You want to start on the bas Chuchi rice. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that your mom's name? END
BEGIN NOW That's my mom's nickname, is Chuchi. Put the sweet plantains directly inside the burrito. END
BEGIN NOW Then we take the vaca END
BEGIN NOW and we roll, squeeze the ends, fold again, push in. END
BEGIN NOW Always make sure you push it in, 'cause it'll blow up on you when it goes and gets dropped for the flash fry. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're gonna fry it? END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna drop it. Cool. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, a Chimi football. There you go. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna slice it open. END
BEGIN NOW You got all that goodness inside. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that. END
BEGIN NOW The avocado lime. END
BEGIN NOW The Crema Mexicana. END
BEGIN NOW Sour cream. END
BEGIN NOW We use these as our fries. We call it our tangled love. END
BEGIN NOW Our fresh pico de gallo. END
BEGIN NOW The Chimi burrito. END
BEGIN NOW Don't do the fork-and-knife thing. END
BEGIN NOW Do it the right way. END
BEGIN NOW Like that. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] You get the salty meat and this deep, rich beef flavor, and then you get that super-seasoned rice, and, all of a sudden, that fried sweet plantain comes in. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, wow. END
BEGIN NOW That is a Thanksgiving in a burrito END
BEGIN NOW just Cuban style END
BEGIN NOW with Mexican influence END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] with French fries on top. END
BEGIN NOW [laughs] Chimi burrito. END
BEGIN NOW The meat is so tender and so full of flavor. END
BEGIN NOW The kicker the maduros. END
BEGIN NOW The plantains, when you take a bite of that, it's like it explodes in your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I want to introduce you to a neighbor of yours 200 yards away over at Scully's. END
BEGIN NOW This is a Triple D legend, man. END
BEGIN NOW So, I thought I would bring him over here to give you a little insight of what happens when you get in the Triple D world. END
BEGIN NOW Just get prepared for it and just get your stamina going, 'cause it's gonna be wall-to-wall. END
BEGIN NOW You got anything else for me in the kitchen? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, we're gonna go do some lobster right now. END
BEGIN NOW The lobster lollipops are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW The presentation is amazing. END
BEGIN NOW Your lobster lollipops. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is a spiny lobster. END
BEGIN NOW This is the way we kind of take apart the lobster. END
BEGIN NOW Go. END
BEGIN NOW You have all this beautiful meat inside. END
BEGIN NOW Nice sharp blade. END
BEGIN NOW You can kind of just slice through. END
BEGIN NOW Then put your weight down on it. END
BEGIN NOW Take your finger, kind of fix it right in there between the meat and the shell. END
BEGIN NOW You want to get nice big chunks. END
BEGIN NOW So, then we take our chunks, put them in our seasoned flour. END
BEGIN NOW We take off the excess flour, and we drop it into our tempura and into the oil. END
BEGIN NOW And we go ahead and take the tails, fry them, and plate them on the presentation and deep-fry the head, also. END
BEGIN NOW Gives it a nice, big, bright-red color. END
BEGIN NOW All right, so this is our lobster lollipops. END
BEGIN NOW It's four sticks, two pieces per stick. Dig it. END
BEGIN NOW We'll go ahead and put the tail on the bottom of the plate. END
BEGIN NOW Our beautiful head. Three sauces. END
BEGIN NOW Mango habanero, the aioli, and the garlic cilantro. END
BEGIN NOW Very, very hot and sweet, so I don't know if you want to start with that one and work your way up. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, that's gonna hurt. END
BEGIN NOW It's like a good burn. Wow! END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, governor! END
BEGIN NOW Cool. END
BEGIN NOW You get a little sweet kiss on the tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Refreshing. And then it just aah! END
BEGIN NOW Just burns out the rest of your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW And then. Our roasted tomato and garlic. END
BEGIN NOW You really get a different profile in each one. END
BEGIN NOW They're great. END
BEGIN NOW And it's super, super fresh. Chef, you rocked the house, man. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, man. Thank you so much. END
BEGIN NOW The lobster pops are delicious. END
BEGIN NOW You dip it in the signature sauces, it's incredible. END
BEGIN NOW This is Dr. Mori, a buddy of mine. END
BEGIN NOW Lives down here in Miami. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what you think of Latin House. END
BEGIN NOW Great stuff. Fantastic. END
BEGIN NOW It's a hidden gem that everybody should experience. END
BEGIN NOW Big thank you to you. END

BEGIN NOW Come on down for the Lumberjack Special. END
BEGIN NOW for a meatball-makin' smackdown. END
BEGIN NOW You know what? I'll be here all week. END
BEGIN NOW So, I'm here in Salt Lake City, Utah, right on Main Street, about four blocks from the state capitol, to check out a joint where an east-coast transplant/ snowboarder/bartender has opened up a joint where he's serving his grandma's recipes. END
BEGIN NOW This is Maxwell's East Coast Eatery. END
BEGIN NOW Four-cheese ravioli in the window. END
BEGIN NOW Donnie Brasco with meatballs. END
BEGIN NOW Scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this place an 11. END
BEGIN NOW Caprese Salad. END
BEGIN NOW It's got that home-style cooking to it. END
BEGIN NOW Flavors Jersey-born Steven Maxwell started serving when he opened in 2008. END
BEGIN NOW How'd you get here? END
BEGIN NOW I went to Park City and planned on bartending for a winter, and I just never left. END
BEGIN NOW That was it? That was it. END
BEGIN NOW How good is this Italian? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what's going on here, but it's an infusion of good stuff that I love, and I just want to get more of it. END
BEGIN NOW Philly cheesesteak. Lasagna. END
BEGIN NOW Yo, chicken parm in the window. END
BEGIN NOW Love the chicken parm. END
BEGIN NOW Big, thick pieces of white chicken. END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing like it in the state of Utah. END
BEGIN NOW that's because the sauce that kicks it off is no Utah native. END
BEGIN NOW What are we making? END
BEGIN NOW Today we're making mom mom's gravy. Who? END
BEGIN NOW Mom mom's my grandmother. END
BEGIN NOW don't see it everywhere else, but west Jersey, see, people call tomato sauce on Sunday is called gravy. END
BEGIN NOW All right, let's hit it. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna sauté a little olive oil with fresh onion, roasted garlic. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW We're just gonna add our San Marzano tomatoes. END
BEGIN NOW Are you gonna marry these back and forth to rinse them out? END
BEGIN NOW I'll do the real deal. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. It's like the bucket brigade. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] All the cans are [whistles] washed out. END
BEGIN NOW Some paste. Now? END
BEGIN NOW Now we're gonna add our dry ingredients. END
BEGIN NOW Sugar, salt, pepper. Dry parsley? END
BEGIN NOW Dry parsley. And a mother lode of basil. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh basil. How long we gonna let this cook? END
BEGIN NOW Six to eight hours. And when this reduce down, we're gonna hit it with an immersion blender? END
BEGIN NOW Exactly. END
BEGIN NOW So, tell me what makes great chicken parmesan. END
BEGIN NOW We use panko breadcrumbs instead of just regular END
BEGIN NOW Italian breadcrumbs. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW It's a little bit lighter, gonna keep the chicken a little bit crispier. END
BEGIN NOW So, this is a Milanese breast, so you cut the breast down. END
BEGIN NOW Are you pounding these first? We are gonna pound them END
BEGIN NOW Awesome. lightly. END
BEGIN NOW Max, you know the old concept wet hand, dry hand? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Avoid Frankenstein fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Is that right? Where did you get that? END
BEGIN NOW That's what we call them in my family. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, really? Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW [groans] [laughs] What we'll do is we'll brown it off both sides, we'll put it onto a tin, and we'll cover it with a mozzarella/provolone mixture, and then we'll bake it off in the oven, melt it up. END
BEGIN NOW Put a little bit of mom mom's gravy in a pan. END
BEGIN NOW Take our homemade fettuccini down into the water, give it a little stir so it doesn't stick. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. Sauce is hot. END
BEGIN NOW Drain our pasta. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken parm's out. Then we'll plate it up. END
BEGIN NOW And next time in Salt Lake City, come on down for the Lumberjack Special. END
BEGIN NOW Dude. You top with some cheese. END
BEGIN NOW Finish with a little parsley. There you go. END
BEGIN NOW Let me put on my muumuu. [chuckles] And this is how your grandma would make it when you were a kid? END
BEGIN NOW This is how she'd make it. END
BEGIN NOW The slow-cooked gravy, homemade pasta, the chicken parm, thick breading, melted cheese, but that's about as real deal as you're gonna get it, ma Nicely done. Nicely done. Right on. END
BEGIN NOW Chicken parmesan. END
BEGIN NOW It's great food, hearty. END
BEGIN NOW All the recipes basically come from your childhood. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. Back to my grandmother's house. END
BEGIN NOW So, you're back to your grandma's house. END
BEGIN NOW Her restaurant was open in the '30s and the '40s, but it was the front of their house, like a lot of immigrants. END
BEGIN NOW All of us, all the kids learned how to roll pasta, make raviolis, gnocchi. END
BEGIN NOW And grandma's recipe for a man-sized meatball. END
BEGIN NOW Spaghetti, 10-ounce meatball. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a little bit intimidated by that meatball. END
BEGIN NOW It's really big. [chuckles] I don't know if I'm gonna be able to eat all that. END
BEGIN NOW Making a 10-ounce meatball. A what? END
BEGIN NOW 10-ounce meatball. Starts at 12, cooks down to 10. END
BEGIN NOW That's how your grandmother used to make it? END

BEGIN NOW All right, let's get into this. All right. END
BEGIN NOW Pepper, parsley, crushed red, kosher salt, oregano, basil. END
BEGIN NOW Finish it off with parmesan cheese. END
BEGIN NOW All the dry comes together. Right on. END

BEGIN NOW Start by adding our eggs. END
BEGIN NOW Drop our dries. END
BEGIN NOW Worcestershire. END
BEGIN NOW Little water for moisture. Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh breadcrumbs. END
BEGIN NOW And we're mixing this all up like a gigantic tartar salad. END
BEGIN NOW [chuckles] Okay, now how good are you at grabbing the 12 ounce of meat? END
BEGIN NOW Takes years of practice. I bet it does. END
BEGIN NOW Hang on. END
BEGIN NOW How close do you think you are? END
BEGIN NOW I'm pretty close. Going for 12 ounces. END
BEGIN NOW Where are we at? 10? END
BEGIN NOW That's not 10. You're looking down at it. END
BEGIN NOW That's 12. [laughs] That's how Look over there! Pretty bird! END
BEGIN NOW I got to go after that 12. END
BEGIN NOW Could be a bit heavy, but we'll see. END
BEGIN NOW Camera shows it at 12. You know what? END
BEGIN NOW I'll be here all week. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, so the meatballs cook off in the oven then get dropped in mom mom's sauce. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna serve them today with spaghetti. END
BEGIN NOW Parmesan. Finish with a little parsley. END
BEGIN NOW New Jersey accent Yeah, come on down to Maxwell's. END

BEGIN NOW Same start, different finish. END
BEGIN NOW Do you like dirty martinis? I like dirty martinis. END
